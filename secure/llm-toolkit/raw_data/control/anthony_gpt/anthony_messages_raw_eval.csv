"Can you transcribe these lists of names into text"
"I'm going to paste two things. The first thing is a bunch of auto generated docs from a python client generator. The second thing is going to be some examples of how to use it. The first thing has examples but it isn't customized to the generated client, it's generic. Can you use the actual examples (second) to update the auto generated readme's examples. Examples aren't comprehensive but you can extrapolate.\n\n# whylogs-container-client\n\nA client library for accessing FastAPI\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, create a client:\n\n```python\nfrom whylogs_container_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(base_url=\"https://api.example.com\")\n```\n\nIf the endpoints you're going to hit require authentication, use `AuthenticatedClient` instead:\n\n```python\nfrom whylogs_container_client import AuthenticatedClient\n\nclient = AuthenticatedClient(base_url=\"https://api.example.com\", token=\"SuperSecretToken\")\n```\n\nNow call your endpoint and use your models:\n\n```python\nfrom whylogs_container_client.models import MyDataModel\nfrom whylogs_container_client.api.my_tag import get_my_data_model\nfrom whylogs_container_client.types import Response\n\nwith client as client:\n    my_data: MyDataModel = get_my_data_model.sync(client=client)\n    # or if you need more info (e.g. status_code)\n    response: Response[MyDataModel] = get_my_data_model.sync_detailed(client=client)\n```\n\nOr do the same thing with an async version:\n\n```python\nfrom whylogs_container_client.models import MyDataModel\nfrom whylogs_container_client.api.my_tag import get_my_data_model\nfrom whylogs_container_client.types import Response\n\nasync with client as client:\n    my_data: MyDataModel = await get_my_data_model.asyncio(client=client)\n    response: Response[MyDataModel] = await get_my_data_model.asyncio_detailed(client=client)\n```\n\nBy default, when you're calling an HTTPS API it will attempt to verify that SSL is working correctly. Using certificate verification is highly recommended most of the time, but sometimes you may need to authenticate to a server (especially an internal server) using a custom certificate bundle.\n\n```python\nclient = AuthenticatedClient(\n    base_url=\"https://internal_api.example.com\",\n    token=\"SuperSecretToken\",\n    verify_ssl=\"/path/to/certificate_bundle.pem\",\n)\n```\n\nYou can also disable certificate validation altogether, but beware that **this is a security risk**.\n\n```python\nclient = AuthenticatedClient(\n    base_url=\"https://internal_api.example.com\",\n    token=\"SuperSecretToken\",\n    verify_ssl=False\n)\n```\n\nThings to know:\n\n1. Every path/method combo becomes a Python module with four functions:\n\n   1. `sync`: Blocking request that returns parsed data (if successful) or `None`\n   1. `sync_detailed`: Blocking request that always returns a `Request`, optionally with `parsed` set if the request was successful.\n   1. `asyncio`: Like `sync` but async instead of blocking\n   1. `asyncio_detailed`: Like `sync_detailed` but async instead of blocking\n\n1. All path/query params, and bodies become method arguments.\n1. If your endpoint had any tags on it, the first tag will be used as a module name for the function (my_tag above)\n1. Any endpoint which did not have a tag will be in `whylogs_container_client.api.default`\n\n## Advanced customizations\n\nThere are more settings on the generated `Client` class which let you control more runtime behavior, check out the docstring on that class for more info. You can also customize the underlying `httpx.Client` or `httpx.AsyncClient` (depending on your use-case):\n\n```python\nfrom whylogs_container_client import Client\n\ndef log_request(request):\n    print(f\"Request event hook: {request.method} {request.url} - Waiting for response\")\n\ndef log_response(response):\n    request = response.request\n    print(f\"Response event hook: {request.method} {request.url} - Status {response.status_code}\")\n\nclient = Client(\n    base_url=\"https://api.example.com\",\n    httpx_args={\"event_hooks\": {\"request\": [log_request], \"response\": [log_response]}},\n)\n\n# Or get the underlying httpx client to modify directly with client.get_httpx_client() or client.get_async_httpx_client()\n```\n\nYou can even set the httpx client directly, but beware that this will override any existing settings (e.g., base_url):\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nfrom whylogs_container_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\n    base_url=\"https://api.example.com\",\n)\n# Note that base_url needs to be re-set, as would any shared cookies, headers, etc.\nclient.set_httpx_client(httpx.Client(base_url=\"https://api.example.com\", proxies=\"http://localhost:8030\"))\n```\n\n## Building / publishing this package\n\nThis project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and packaging. Here are the basics:\n\n1. Update the metadata in pyproject.toml (e.g. authors, version)\n1. If you're using a private repository, configure it with Poetry\n   1. `poetry config repositories.<your-repository-name> <url-to-your-repository>`\n   1. `poetry config http-basic.<your-repository-name> <username> <password>`\n1. Publish the client with `poetry publish --build -r <your-repository-name>` or, if for public PyPI, just `poetry publish --build`\n\nIf you want to install this client into another project without publishing it (e.g. for development) then:\n\n1. If that project **is using Poetry**, you can simply do `poetry add <path-to-this-client>` from that project\n1. If that project is not using Poetry:\n   1. Build a wheel with `poetry build -f wheel`\n   1. Install that wheel from the other project `pip install <path-to-wheel>`\n\n\n\n\nREAL EXAMPLES\n\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeVar\n\nimport whylogs_container_client.api.llm.validate_llm as ValidateLLM\nimport whylogs_container_client.api.manage.health as Health\nimport whylogs_container_client.api.manage.status as Status\nimport whylogs_container_client.api.profile.log as Log\nfrom whylogs_container_client import AuthenticatedClient\nfrom whylogs_container_client.models import LogRequest, ProcessLoggerStatusResponse\nfrom whylogs_container_client.models.llm_validate_request import LLMValidateRequest\nfrom whylogs_container_client.models.validation_report import ValidationReport\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\n\ndef _retry(func: Callable[[], T], max_retries=10, interval=0.5) -> T:\n    \"\"\"\n    Retry a function until it succeeds or the max_retries is reached.\n    \"\"\"\n    retry_count = 0\n    while retry_count < max_retries:\n        try:\n            return func()\n        except Exception:\n            time.sleep(interval)\n            retry_count += 1\n\n    raise Exception(f\"Failed to run function after {retry_count} retries\")\n\n\nclass ContainerClient:\n    def __init__(self, port: int = 8000) -> None:\n        self.port = port\n        self.client = AuthenticatedClient(base_url=f\"http://localhost:{port}\", token=\"password\", prefix=\"\", auth_header_name=\"X-API-Key\")  # type: ignore\n\n    def health(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Check if the container is running.

"The problem with this design is that every once in awhile once the pressure is alleviated because water evaporates, the water from the tank will make a gurgling sound as it pours out until equilibrium is reached. Again. My idea for fixing this is to drill a small hole at the top of the tank to allow water to flow in in the hope that the water outflow would be more even and wouldn't have a gurgling sound"
