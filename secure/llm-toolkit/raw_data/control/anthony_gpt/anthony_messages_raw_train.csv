However, there remains a fundamental knowledge gap in nanoplastics because of the lack of effective analytical techniques. This study developed a powerful optical imaging technique for rapid analysis of nanoplastics with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. As a demonstration, micro-nano plastics in bottled water are analyzed with multidimensional profiling of individual plastic particles. Quantification suggests more than 105 particles in each liter of bottled water, the majority of which are nanoplastics. This study holds the promise to bridge the knowledge gap on plastic pollution at the nano level.\nAbstract\nPlastics are now omnipresent in our daily lives. The existence of microplastics (1 µm to 5 mm in length) and possibly even nanoplastics (<1 μm) has recently raised health concerns. In particular, nanoplastics are believed to be more toxic since their smaller size renders them much more amenable, compared to microplastics, to enter the human body. However, detecting nanoplastics imposes tremendous analytical challenges on both the nano-level sensitivity and the plastic-identifying specificity, leading to a knowledge gap in this mysterious nanoworld surrounding us. To address these challenges, we developed a hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging platform with an automated plastic identification algorithm that allows micro-nano plastic analysis at the single-particle level with high chemical specificity and throughput. We first validated the sensitivity enhancement of the narrow band of SRS to enable high-speed single nanoplastic detection below 100 nm. We then devised a data-driven spectral matching algorithm to address spectral identification challenges imposed by sensitive narrow-band hyperspectral imaging and achieve robust determination of common plastic polymers. With the established technique, we studied the micro-nano plastics from bottled water as a model system. We successfully detected and identified nanoplastics from major plastic types. Micro-nano plastics concentrations were estimated to be about 2.4 ± 1.3 × 105 particles per liter of bottled water, about 90% of which are nanoplastics. This is orders of magnitude more than the microplastic abundance reported previously in bottled water. High-throughput single-particle counting revealed extraordinary particle heterogeneity and nonorthogonality between plastic composition and morphologies; the resulting multidimensional profiling sheds light on the science of nanoplastics.\nSign up for PNAS alerts.\nGet alerts for new articles, or get an alert when an article is cited.\n\nPlastic pollution has been a rising global concern, with increasing plastic consumption every year (1). Microplastic contaminations have been identified to prevalently from almost everywhere in the environments and even human biological samples (2–4). Moreover, mounting discoveries suggest that the fragmentation of plastic polymer does not stop at the micron level but rather continues to form nanoplastics with expected quantities orders of magnitude higher (5). With engineered plastic particles with fluorescent dyes or metal labels, researchers have shown the possibility of nanoplastics crossing biological barriers and entering the biological systems (6–9), raising public concern on its potential toxicity (10).\nDespite the urge to assess the concern, nanoplastics analysis remains challenging with traditional techniques. Unlike engineered nanoparticles prepared in laboratory as model systems, real nanoplastics in the environment are intrinsically label-free and have significant heterogeneity in both chemical composition and particle morphologies (11), which are likely to endure correspondingly different toxicity implications (12, 13). To address the existing knowledge gap on nanoplastics regarding their source, abundance, fate, and potential toxicity encoded in such a heterogeneous population, single-particle imaging with chemical specificity is undoubtedly essential to avoid informational loss from ensemble measurement. However, traditional single-particle chemical imaging techniques, namely FTIR or Raman microscopy, suffer from relatively poor instrumental resolution and detection sensitivity (14, 15), which limit their success in revealing the heterogeneity only at microplastic level (16, 17). Particle imaging techniques with nano-sensitivity for plastic particles, such as electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, lack the crucial chemical specificity to distinguish different compositions (18, 19). Extensive efforts have been made; however, most techniques are still bound by the fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, a recurring theme in analytical science (15, 20). Single-particle imaging with chemical spectroscopy, recently demonstrated by AFM-IR and STXM (21–23), tends to have too low throughput (>10 min/µm2 with spectra for plastic identification) to quantify environmental micro-nano plastics with sufficient particle statistics. In summary, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput of single-particle analysis are the three crucial requirements to analyze nanoplastics in real-life samples.\nHerein, we introduce a data science–driven hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy as a powerful platform of nanoplastics detection to meet the three requirements. SRS microscopy utilizes stimulated Raman spectroscopy as the imaging contrast mechanism and has found increasing utility in biomedical imaging (24–27). While SRS is often credited for speeding up regular Raman imaging by over 1,000 times (26–29), which enables fast identification of microplastics (30, 31), the utility for it to analyze nanoplastic remains to be explored. To maximize the sensitivity needed for single-particle detection, we adopted a narrowband SRS imaging scheme by focusing all the energy of the stimulating beam to target characteristic vibrational modes with the largest Raman cross-sections (32). We then showed that, both theoretically and experimentally, narrowband SRS imaging can enable the detection of nanoplastic as small as 100 nm. However, the limited spectral features from only the strongest vibrational signatures above the detection limit impose challenges on automated spectrum identification, which is essential for high-throughput plastic particle analysis. To address this fundamental sensitivity-specificity trade-off and unleash the full potential of hyperspectral SRS imaging, we devised a data-driven SRS-tailored spectral matching algorithm based on the spectral library of seven common plastic standards. The intrinsic chemical specificity from vibrational signatures in the shape of SRS spectroscopy is successfully recovered for automated polymer identification for nanoplastic detection with the help of the data science.\nEquipped with this platform, we then studied micro-nano plastics in daily consumed bottled water as a prototype of a real-life sample. Individual particles for all seven plastic polymers from the library were identified, enabling statistical analysis of plastic particles with sizes down to 100 to 200 nm. The exposure to micro-nano plastics was estimated with a specified polymer composition. Integrating morphological information from imaging, multi-dimensional characterizations of individual plastic particles are reported, unveiling the all-around heterogeneities of plastic particles in a hidden micro-nano world encircling us.\n1. SRS Imaging of Polystyrene Nanospheres with Single-Particle Sensitivity\nSRS microscopy is well known to be orders of magnitude faster than regular Raman imaging (25, 26). The drastically higher imaging speed of SRS microscopy hence provides high throughput on particle imaging. However, whether high-speed SRS has a better detection limit than regular Raman and whether it can actually reach the single-particle sensitivity of nanoplastics are not obvious. A theoretical quantification is helpful to address the question in the first place. For a given major type of plastic polymer, we can estimate the mass of a 100-nm-diameter nanoplastics based on the plastic density and calculate the number of repeating units (i.e., constituting monomer) via its molecular weight. As shown in SI Appendix, Table S1, this number is around 106 for most major plastic types, based on which we can further estimated the number of most abundant chemical bonds in a single plastic particle to be ~107.\nWe can then theoretically explain why a 100 nm nanoplastic particle is difficult to be detected by conventional Raman microscopy. The spontaneous Raman cross-section of a typical C–H vibration is about 10−29 cm2. Hence, the spontaneous Raman cross-section of a 100-nm nanoparticle is 10−22 cm2. The laser waist area can be shrunk to about 2 × 10−9 cm2 under a high numerical aperture microscope objective. The probability of Raman scattering event per excitation photon is then (10−22 cm2)/(2 × 10−9 cm2) = 5 × 10−14. Assuming a moderately high laser power of 10 mW with a conventional 532 nm laser, which corresponds to an excitation flux of 3 × 1016 photons/s, and a rather long acquisition time of 100 ms (a small 128 × 128 image will take half an hour), only about 130 photons can be generated per particle in total via spontaneous Raman scattering. Considering the quantum yield of the entire instrument (including objective, filters, pinhole, spectrometer, and camera) typically is ~1%, roughly only 1.3 photons can be ultimately detected. Such a feeble signal can be easily overwhelmed by noise from other backgrounds such as autofluorescence.\nBy employing an additional coherent Stokes laser, SRS amplifies the feeble scattering crossing section of a specific spectral mode (defined by the energy difference between pump and Stokes lasers) via quantum stimulation. When a pulsed narrowband Stokes laser is used (24, 33), the stimulated Raman enhancement factor can be maximized to more than 108 (32, 34). The probability of a stimulated Raman scattering event per pump excitation photon then becomes 5 × 10−6, which is measured as a stimulated Raman loss experienced by the pump beam targeting C–H vibration. The noise of the pump beam under high-speed SRS microscopy acquisition (18 µs/pixel) is measured to be 5 × 10−7 (Fig. 1), which is about 10× lower than the expected stimulated Raman loss signal from a single 100-nm plastic particle. Thus, we predict that narrowband SRS shall break the detectability barrier of spontaneous Raman and bring a single nanoplastic particle into detection in just tens of microseconds.\nFig. 1.\n\nSRS imaging of standard PS micro-nano spheres for detection sensitivity and resolution characterization.

The red dashed line shows a linear fitting (R2 = 0.998) with a slope of 2.98. Error bars, mean ± SD. Red solid line indicates shot-noise-limited SRS detection limit where SNR = 1.\nWe then experimentally verify the detection sensitivity using standard plastic particles. Polystyrene is one of the most common plastics widely used in daily life. Polystyrene particles of specified sizes are commercially available as analytical standards and have been routinely used as a model material to study micro-nanoplastics (35, 36). The Raman spectrum of polystyrene suggests a prominent peak at 3,050 cm−1 from aromatic C–H vibration on the phenyl ring (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), which can be selectively amplified for SRS imaging by tuning the difference of pump and Stokes beams to match this transition energy. Using commercial PS micro-nano spheres from 100 nm to 3 µm, we evaluated the detection sensitivity of our SRS microscope in imaging nanoplastics. To stabilize the particles during imaging, we embedded the diluted PS particles in agarose gel. As the particle size goes smaller, the residue of the water background around 3,000 cm−1 starts to dominate (SI Appendix, Fig. S2a), overwhelming the authentic spectrum of individual PS nanoparticles. To resolve this background issue for better imaging contrast, we substituted regular H2O with D2O to prepare the agarose gel (SI Appendix, Fig. S2b). Compared to H2O, the Raman spectrum of D2O is red-shifted to the silent region (2,200 to 2,800 cm−1, SI Appendix, Fig. S3), creating a background-free environment for probing C–H vibration.\nSRS intensity of individual particles can be thereby measured from single-channel narrow-band imaging with high-throughput (~1,000 particles in one 51 × 51 µm FOV within 2 s, SI Appendix, Fig. S4). This imaging speed is orders of magnitude faster than other nanoplastic imaging techniques, such as AFM-IR and STXM (21, 23, 37). With the optical diffraction limit, the optimal spatial resolution of SRS microscopy is measured to be 365 nm (Fig. 1 H and I). With a spatial sampling of 200 nm pixel size for high-throughput imaging, individual PS nanospheres of above 500 nm can be discerned with their shape from the images (Fig. 1 D–G). When the size of the particles goes smaller than the diffraction limit (Fig. 1 A–C), the finite optical resolution renders the particle image a diffraction-limited pattern. Yet, the SRS intensity of a single particle can still be readily recognized down to 100 nm based on the diffraction limit pattern and the intensity distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Thus experimentally, we have shown that compared to regular spontaneous Raman, SRS imaging can offer orders of magnitude higher imaging speed/throughput and a superior limit of detection for nanoplastics analysis.\nA linear relationship was observed between the logarithm of SRS signal ( \n ) and the logarithm of diameter for PS particles smaller than 0.7 µm (Fig. 1J and SI Appendix, Supplementary Note3). The trendline with a slope of 2.98 within the range indicates the SRS signal ( \n ) increase linearly with the particles’ volume, which scales in cubic as the particles’ diameters increase. When the particles’ size is enlarged to overfill the effective focal volume sequentially in first x, y, and later z dimensions (SI Appendix, Fig. S14), the linear dependency disappears. This good linearity (R2 = 0.998) is due to the fundamental linear dependency of the SRS signal on the concentration of the target analyte, providing powerful utilities in several aspects. First, the actual size of particles below the diffraction limit can be estimated based on the obtained calibration curve (SI Appendix, Fig. S16a), extending the size characterization limit. Second, with the known information on the plastic density, the same calibration curve can be transformed into a reference to deduce a particle mass out of a detected SRS nanoplastics image (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note3 and Fig. S16b). Finally, taking an SNR of one as the threshold, the detection limit of our narrowband SRS microscope can be determined (Fig. 1K) to reach PS nanospheres down to 60 nm.\n2. Fundamental Challenges on Chemical Identification of Nanoplastics with Hyperspectral SRS Imaging\nNano-sensitivity solves the first-order issue to ensure the plastic particles are detectable. The chemical specificity of a technique is also crucial to identify plastics from other co-existing substances and further distinguishing plastic polymers from each other. Harnessing vibrational spectroscopy as imaging contrast, SRS microscopy, in principle, holds the demanded specificity for chemical imaging. Instrumentally, we perform hyperspectral SRS imaging via the spectral-focusing technique (38, 39). To best cover the characteristic strong feature of the plastic Raman spectrum (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) within the tuning range of the instrument (790 to 910 nm), we carefully choose 793, 804, 886, and 897 nm as four central wavelengths to include the strong and characteristic spectral features of C–H (unsaturated and saturated carbons, 3,110 to 2,800 cm−1), ester bonds (1,770 to 1,670 cm−1), and double bond vibration (1,660 to 1,580 cm−1) for better distinguishment between each plastic type. We constructed a small library by measuring the bulk SRS spectra of seven most common plastic polymers (Fig. 2A): polyamide 66 (PA), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with fine spectral intervals (~3 cm−1).\nFig. 2.\n\nRecovering the chemical specificity for polymer identification with SRS-tailored data-driven spectral matching algorithms. (A) Normalized SRS spectra of plastic standards (PA, PE, PET, PMMA, PP, PS, and PVC) and a nonplastic standard (E. coli). (B and C) Examples of particle spectra: (B) particle A: PA microparticle (C) particle B: standard PS nanosphere. (D and E) Similarity quantification results for particles A and B from conventional spectral-matching algorithms: (D) Pearson’s correlation coefficients and (E) Squared Euclidean Cosine (SEC). The red dashed line indicates the threshold condition with 95% identification rate from the standard PS nanospheres. The same threshold condition creates elusive identification for particle A. (F) The learning process is indicated by the scatter plot of ln(SMCSRS) against SRS intensity α obtained from Eq. 1. Solid data points are from the synthetic dataset based on standards. The blue circular data points are experimental data from hyperspectral SRS imaging of PS nanospheres of three different sizes, which well colocalize with the points from the synthetic PS spectrum (light blue) with good separation from synthetic data from other chemical compositions (solid data points in other colors). The red solid line indicates the threshold line drawn for plastic polymer identification. (G) Confusion matrix for threshold condition evaluation based on experimental plastic particle measurement (H–N). Polymer identification results of the example particle A and particle B using SRS-tailored data-driven spectral matching algorithms. In each image of (H–N), the black line is the determined threshold from the learning process. The light blue circle from standard PS particle B is confirmed perfectly only with the PS matching scheme having the SMCSRS value below the threshold line (Fig. 2M). The red circle from unknown particle A is unambiguously identified to be PA with only the PA matching scheme having the SMCSRS value below the threshold line (Fig. 2H).\nUnlike bulk spectra measurement, single-particle imaging of nanoplastics requires a much smaller pixel size, longer integration time, and higher power for optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, due to the fundamental trade-off between detection sensitivity and specificity, it is nearly impossible to measure nanoplastics with such fine spectral intervals (hours of imaging time per FOV with increasing possibility of sample drifting and burning during the time). Moreover, the spectral resolution of a hyperspectral SRS microscope based on spectral focusing is typically 10 to 25 cm−1. For efficient hyperspectral imaging with a proper balance between throughput and spectral resolution, we further subsampled the spectra (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) with the spectral interval of ~15 cm−1, which is only slightly above the spectral resolution and yielded acceptable imaging throughput (~0.5 h per 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm FOV) for single-particle chemical imaging of nanoplastics.\nHigh-throughput plastic particle analysis also requires automated spectral analysis for plastic identification. Spectral matching algorithms for automated chemical identification are prevalently adopted in microplastic analysis based on FTIR or Raman spectroscopy (40, 41). With thousands of particle spectra in need of analysis in a typical environmental study, manual plastic identification and counting are not only impossibly labor-intensive but also subjected to human bias (14, 40–42). Automated particle analysis helps to speed up the measurement, analyze more particles, as well as ensure ubiquitous and unbiased plastic identification. Understanding the need for automation in environmental science, we started with applying the classic library matching algorithms in FTIR and Raman analysis but found them not so compatible with narrow-band SRS hyperspectral analysis. Take a detected spectrum from particle A prepared from grinding the PA standard as an example (Fig. 2B). After spectrum pre-processing on background subtraction and data normalization, the spectrum of particle A clearly matches the SRS signature of polyamide. However, when measuring the spectral similarities of particle A to bulk plastic standards from the library using common spectral matching algorithms (42), such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PC) or squared Euclidean cosine (SEC) measurement, the identification results appears elusive (Fig. 2 D and E). In a real-life sample analysis, there should be no premise to assume particle A should belong to any standard plastics in the library, which means a yes or no judgment has to be made independently for each plastic standard based on a given threshold. The common threshold employed in FTIR or spontaneous Raman analysis of microplastics is the similarity measurement above 0.7, which is clearly too low to identify Particle A. Since PS nanoparticles are available as model standards, we first try to study the similarity threshold of each algorithm for nanoplastics analysis under hyperspectral SRS imaging. The similarity threshold can then be determined based on the quartile of identifying at least 95% of the PS particles (similarity index above 0.75 for PC, and similarity index above 0.94 for SEC). However, the challenging part of making a binary identification judgment remains in the case of particle A as similarity measurements from three plastic polymers (PA, PP, and PVC) are very close in number and all above the threshold (Fig. 2 D and E). Note that one cannot simply pick the best score among all the standards because it is totally possible for A to be nonplastic materials in real sample analysis. In fact, if we simulate the possible nonplastic SRS spectra based on the model standard spectrum of biomass represented by E. coli, over 95% of them will have similarity measurements against PA standard over the given threshold for both two algorithms (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 a and b).\nWe reflect that the main reason underlying the above difficulty stems from the trade-off between detection sensitivity and specificity. Emphasizing the chemical specificity, spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, or other broadband coherent Raman microscopy can cover an extended spectral window (>1,000 cm−1) by distributing the optical power among a large number of Raman vibrational modes. The rich spectral information can enable chemical identification with simple algorithms but comes with the cost of over thousand times compromised detection sensitivity under a limited pixel dwell time (43–45). However, in the context of nanoplastics analysis, detecting the particle signal is the premise before chemical identification from the vibrational spectrum. With the aim of measuring as small plastic particles as possible under practical throughput, eventually, only the strongest Raman features will be detectable with reasonable SNR. For most plastics, which are organic polymers by nature, the strongest Raman signatures reside within the limited C–H vibration window. In this case, specific chemical identification requires the algorithms to precisely capture the shape feature within the restricted spectral window, which is beyond the capacity of conventional spectral matching algorithms. Moreover, the inevitably compromised and circumscribed signal-to-noise ratio when imaging diminutive nanoparticles create further challenges in spectral interpretation for robust chemical identification. Therefore, new methods are demanded to address the specificity challenge imposed by the SRS instrumentation that enables unprecedented sensitivity in imaging nanoplastics.\n3. Data-Driven SRS-Tailored Spectral Matching Algorithm Recovers Chemical Specificity\nHarnessing data science, we aim to develop algorithms to interpret the shape of detected SRS features and retrieve the chemical specificity for polymer identification. First, an SRS-tailored spectral matching coefficient (SMCSRS) is developed as an indicator to quantify spectral similarity with minimized noise interference (Fig. 2, eq. 1). SMCSRS uses an optimization algorithm that considers the detected SRS spectrum \n originating from scaling (intensity factor α\n ) the normalized bulk standard spectrum \n plus a certain background contribution at the imaging condition ( β\n , β\n < 1). The fitted spectrum ( αβ\n ) was compared with the detected particle spectrum \n to find the minimum possible spectral distance as SMCSRS. The smaller SMCSRS value indicates a higher spectral similarity to the corresponding standards. This indicator SMCSRS provides several advantages for the purpose of detecting nanoplastics. The optimization algorithm considers all spectral points simultaneously, which reduces the direct influences induced by the noise on each particular spectral point. The fitting process leverages the reliability of the similarity measurement. In addition, the outcome of the measurement is interpretable. The well-defined intensity factor α and background factor β can indicate the contribution from each spectral component (the particle and the surrounding backgrounds). Finally, the spectral distance measurement provides metric similarity evaluation.\nWith the spectral similarity quantified in this refined way, we returned to face the challenge of making a nonarbitrary binary judgment for polymer identification. We planned to develop a learning-based method to determine the previously elusive binary threshold for the identification of all plastic polymers. Our premise is that if we can measure the nanoparticle spectra for all types of plastics within the library, we shall be able to learn from the data and draw the correct boundary for identification based on the distribution of the particles with known identities. However, in reality, only PS nanospheres are commercially available to us with well-characterized chemical composition and nano sizes. Without reliable ground truth from other polymer nanoparticles, we have to seek alternative ways to gather the massive information needed for rigorous threshold determination.\nInspired by the increasing utilities of synthetic data in AI (46), and the growing involvement of data science in SRS microscopy (47–49), we realized that we could simulate the experimental SRS spectra of nanoplastics from the bulk standard spectra to serve as a training dataset (i.e., synthetic data). Based on our understanding of the SRS instrumentation, we proposed a model, where there are two main sources of noise in a typical hyperspectral SRS spectrum: one is fundamental noise on the SRS intensity as in a shot-noise-limited scenario, which can be easily read out from the same SRS image; the other is the frequency uncertainty imposed by the SRS instrumentation, where both the laser profile and the moving delay stage can result in fluctuation of the actual frequency excited in each measurement around the preset spectral points. Assuming the fluctuation follows a Gaussian distribution, we used PS nanospheres as the standard model to investigate the fluctuation range and found an impressive consistency in SMCSRS calculation from the synthetic spectra and measured spectra of PS nanoparticles (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 2 and Fig. S10). The combinatory nature of noise origins explains the dependency of the SMCSRS value on the intensity of the spectrum ( α\n ), as suggested in the simulation and validated by the experiment (Fig. 2F).\nApplying the same model for all standards in the library, we generated a synthetic dataset containing the possible SRS spectra for nanoplastics of each polymer in the plastic library. A nice separation of the SMCSRS value appears between the spectra of particle \n ( \n , R is the correct identity of standard polymer) and spectra of particle \n ( \n ) in all scatter plots (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). With the massively generated synthetic data points, a logarithmic function was fitted according to the trend of the scattered points as the threshold line for polymer identification (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 2 and Table S2).\nWe first evaluate the identification performance by simulating another synthetic dataset from all standards in the library as testing data. Compared with conventional spectral matching algorithms, the SRS-tailored developed shows minimal false positives in plastic identification (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). No more than 0.5% of nonplastic spectra (simulated from E. coli) is misidentified as a hit for any plastic types in the library (SI Appendix, Fig. S12c), which is a drastic improvement from over 97% using conventional spectral matching algorithms (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 a and b). False positive between polymers of similar SRS spectrum is also much reduced with the maximum to be around 5% PA misidentified as PP (SI Appendix, Fig. S12c). The same number is also as high as over 97% if PC or SEC are used as similarity measurements with the determined thresholds (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 a and b).\nTo further address the possible rare cases where a particle is identified as hits for more than one polymer in the library, the chemical identity of the corresponding particle will be assigned to the polymer with the smallest SMCSRS value. With the established spectral identification workflow, an over 96% identification rate can be achieved with a false positive rate below 1% for all polymers in the library (SI Appendix, Fig. S12d). Since PS nanosphere was the only available nanoplastic standard, the experimental validation of the workflow is based on the imaging of the corresponding microplastics prepared from grinding the polymer standards with the cryo-mill. Hoping to mimic a similar level of spectral variation to the best extent, the imaging condition is adjusted accordingly to match the signal-to-noise ratio of nanoplastic measurement. Finally, we confirmed the same identification rate of over 96% in the experimental particle measurement with no observed plastic particles misidentified as other polymers within the library (Fig. 2G).\nDevelopment of this data-driven algorithm allows for the identification of each plastic polymer with distinct vibrational features in a restricted spectral window, thus retrieving the required chemical specificity for automated spectral identification. Revisiting the identification of particle A and standard PS nanosphere B, we can correctly identify both particle A and particle B across the library to be PA and PS (Fig. 2 H–N), with SMCSRS well captures the shape differences missed by conventional algorithms and threshold learned from the data-driven study. Coupling the mindset from data science with advanced measurement science, we finally overcome the fundamental sensitivity-specificity trade-off for high throughput hyperspectral SRS analysis. Superb nano-sensitivity from narrow-band SRS amplification and chemical specificity with robust chemical identification are simultaneously accomplished to fill the missing void in tools for nanoplastics analysis.\n4. Developing Workflow for Micro-Nano Plastic Detection from Bottled Water\nWith the platform established, we moved on to apply the utility to study micro-nano plastics from real-life samples. Microplastics have been widely found in human foods (50), drinks (51), and product packaging (52–55), among which bottled water is of particular interest for being an important source of microplastics to be ingested in daily life (56–59). Limited by the sensitivity-specificity trade-off in analytical science (SI Appendix, Fig. S18b), the literature knowledge is constrained to microplastics in bottled water (SI Appendix, Table S4) (19, 60–62), leaving the nanoplastics mostly uncharted. So far, only ensemble characterizations using combinations of techniques are reported to analyze the aliquots of concentrated nanoparticles from bottled water. Information is demanded to address the intrinsic heterogeneity of nanoplastics contamination at a single-particle level (SI Appendix, Fig. S18a) (63, 64). Here, we report a concise workflow for comprehensive micro-nano plastics characterization enabled by rapid single-particle chemical imaging with nano-sensitivity by SRS microscopy. Rich information can be acquired from a single measurement to achieve simultaneous characterization of chemical composition and morphology, enabling multi-dimensional statistics through high-throughput single-particle analysis.\nFiltration is one of the most common methods to collect particles above certain sizes onto a membrane surface. It would be highly preferable for analyzing real-world samples if the collected membrane is directly compatible for SRS imaging. Aluminum oxide membranes have minimal background in the target spectral window and have shown good compatibility with vibrational spectroscopy. The seemingly opaque aluminum oxide membrane can be easily transformed into a transparent imaging window by applying heavy water to reduce refractive index mismatch. This resulted in transmissive SRS imaging with acceptable signal retention (~70% of the original sensitivity, SI Appendix, Fig. S7 b and c). Embedding the particles on the membrane surface in situ with agarose gel prepared with D2O further enabled stationary SRS imaging of individual particles with minimal imaging background. In this way, a concise sample preprocessing is enough for high-quality SRS imaging of the original filtration membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S7a), avoiding undesirable sample loss or contamination in any complicated sample drying or transferring processes.\nThe established workflow for analyzing micro-nano plastics exposure from bottled water with hyperspectral SRS imaging is presented in Fig. 3. For each sample, five or more fields of views (FOVs) were randomly sampled within the collecting area for hyperspectral imaging under SRS microscopy (Fig. 3D). In each FOV, micro-nano plastics were detected by an integrated data analysis workflow that automatically performed the particle segmentation and plastic identification with the developed algorithms and validated threshold conditions. Morphological and chemical information of each individual plastic particle obtained from the hyperspectral SRS images was then combined to provide high-dimensional profiling (Fig. 3E). Following the procedure, we analyzed bottled water from three different brands acquired at the same time from a large retailer. With no access to plastic-free water in the lab (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 6), the Anodisc filters are prepared and measured in the same way as blank control. In the results, we were able to detect individual particles for all seven plastic polymers in the library unambiguously by spectral matching with their corresponding bulk standards (Fig. 4), demonstrating the powerful plastic identification capability of our data-driven hyperspectral SRS imaging platform.\nFig. 3.\n\nDetecting micro-nano plastics in bottled water: sample preparation, SRS imaging, and data analysis. (A) Scheme of the filtration setup for collecting micro-nano plastic particles from bottled water. The particles from the two bottles of water samples are concentrated onto a circular area (d = 13 mm) at the center of the membrane following the procedure described in Supplementary information. (B) Scheme of membrane sandwiching to prepare transparent membrane samples for SRS imaging. The obtained sample (Fig. 3C) is then mounted onto the microscope (Fig. 3D) for hyperspectral SRS imaging. (C) The obtained transparent membrane sample superimposed with a fluorescence image of the standard fluorescent PS particles collected on the membrane illustrates the uniform particle distribution on a circular surface in the center of the membrane (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 5). (D) Scheme of the SRS microscope. (E) Scheme of automated plastic particle identification. The preprocessed stacks of hyperspectral SRS images are analyzed by a MATLAB script for automated plastic particle identification. For each on-resonance image for the target plastic polymer, detected particles are segmented as regions of interest (ROIs) to extract the chemical and morphological information for analysis. The SRS spectrum is extracted in each particle/ROI by intensity measurement across the hyperspectral image stack. For particles with SRS peaks in the correct corresponding spectral window, spectral similarity to the target plastic standard is quantified by calculating SMCSRS with the threshold condition applied to make the plastic identification judgment. Morphological information such as size and shape is extracted in the course of image analysis, and statistical pictures composed by each identified individual plastic particle are created subsequently.\nFig. 4.\n\nIndividual micro-nano plastic identified for each target polymer from bottled water.

(Scale bar, 0.6 µm.) Most of these particles are below 1 µm. (H–N) Corresponding SRS spectra of the detected plastic particles. The blue lines are the spectra of detected particles. The orange lines are the matched spectra from the plastic standards.\n5. Multidimensional Profiling of Micro-Nano Plastic in Bottled Water\nQuantification from single-particle images with identified plastic polymer composition provides multi-dimensional information to build the analytical panorama of underexplored nanoplastics in bottled water.\nNumber quantification through particle counting suggests that on average, 78 to 103 plastic particles were identified in each FOV (0.2 mm × 0.2 mm) for three different brands, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the blank samples (Fig. 5A). Assuming a uniform distribution of micro-nano plastic particles on the surface of the membrane region (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 5), we can make an estimation for the micro-nano plastic exposure from bottled water. We estimate that there are on average about 2.4 ± 1.3 \n 105 plastic particles ingested from every liter of bottled water measured from different brands(Fig. 5C). Individual particles of each type of polymer are analyzed separately to reveal chemical heterogeneity. Within the library, PA, PP, PET, PVC, and PS are found likely to play a significant role in micro-nano plastics exposure from bottled water (Fig. 5B). The exact chemical composition of the micro-nano plastics varied from brand to brand, but PA seem to be the common major contributors in number among all the three brands we analyzed.\nFig. 5.\n\nQuantification of micro-nano plastic exposure from bottled water. (A) Averaged number of plastic particles detected per field of view. Error bars, mean ± SEM. (B) Averaged number of particles for each plastic polymer detected per field of view. Error bars, mean ± SEM. Statistically significant differences were determined using generalized linear mixed model analysis with Bonferroni correction. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. (C) The number of plastic particles estimated in 1 L of bottled water. Error bars, mean ± SEM. (D) Number proportion of each plastic polymer measured in each brand of bottled water. (E) Mass of plastic particles estimated from SRS intensity in 1 L of bottled water. Error bars, mean ± SEM. (F) Mass proportion of each plastic polymer measured in each brand of bottled water.\nHarnessing the linear relationship between SRS intensity and the amount of analytes within the focal volume, we are also able to provide an estimation of exposure in mass besides particle number. The mass calibration curve can be estimated for each polymer out of density and relative SRS intensity from the linear relationship obtained by standard PS nanospheres (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). Integrated intensity within the region of interest for each particle is thus converted to mass (Fig. 5 E and F). The estimated micro-nano plastic exposure in mass is calculated to be at the level of around 10 ng/L. Analyzing the chemical composition in mass, we find unneglectable differences between contribution quantified by mass and contribution by number. Take the results from Brand C as an example. The PS nanoplastics though dominated in particle number, only account for a minor portion of the mass. Instead, PET becomes the major contributor together in mass. Such seeming disparity highlights the potential misunderstanding of plastic composition from collective particle characterization, which originated from the heterogeneous nature of micro-nano plastics from real-world samples.\nMorphological characterization of individual particles enabled by SRS microscopy directly reveals another dimension of particle heterogeneity. Statistical analysis of particle size and shape from the images of individual micro-nano particles with well-defined identities is reported. When measuring the size distribution, we are able to characterize particles below the diffraction limit by extrapolating the size from the intensity reading (assuming the particles as solid spheres) and by using the linear relationship between the volume of the particles and SRS signal as calibration (SI Appendix, Supplementary Note 3). As a result, we find that plastic particles of different chemical compositions actually have different size distribution patterns (Fig. 6 A–G). The direct observation of the particle heterogeneity here provides a natural explanation of chemical compositional differences observed from mass or number measurement. Take PS and PET as an example: the size distribution of PS particles centers around 100 to 200 nm, whereas PET particles tend to have a size distribution that nears 1 to 2 microns, which explains why PET is a more significant component when measuring in mass while PS clearly dominates when counting the number of particles (Fig. 5 D and F).\nFig. 6.\n\nStatistical profiles of particles’ size and shape for each plastic polymer found in bottled water. (A–G) Size distribution of the detected particles for each plastic polymer: (A) polyamide, (B) polypropylene, (C) polyethylene, (D) polymethyl methacrylate, (E) polyvinyl chloride, (F) polystyrene, and (G) polyethylene terephthalate. The red shaded area indicates the microplastics. The green shade area indicates the particles with sizes below the optical resolution of SRS microscopy, which are detected in a diffraction-limit pattern. For particles with size above the diffraction limit, the size of the particles is measured by minimum Feret’s diameter. For particles detected as diffraction-limited patterns, the actual size of the particles is estimated from SRS intensity harnessing the linear relationship between SRS intensity and the volume of the nanoparticles, assuming that nanoplastics exist as a solid sphere. (H) Shape distribution of the detected particles for each plastic polymer measured by aspect ratio. (I–M) Representative SRS images of plastic particles with various shapes indicated by different aspect ratios. SI Appendix, Fig. S9 shows the corresponding SRS spectra. (Scale bar, 0.6 µm.)\nThe shape is another important morphological feature that matters as a critical aspect of nanotoxicity. Studies have shown that shape plays a role in determining the cellular uptake of micro-nano particles (65, 66). SRS images of plastic particles confirmed the existence of shape diversity for micro-nano plastics in bottled water. To account for the shape of plastic particles in a statistical manner, we measure the aspect ratio of individual particles above the diffraction limit (Fig. 6H). The aspect ratio is widely acknowledged in nanotoxicology studies (67, 68). The aspect ratio of the plastic particles detected ranges from 1 to 6, and the average aspect ratio for particles is around 1.7. Fig. 6 I–M provides a pictorial view of how the aspect ratio is related to the particle shape. Particles with an aspect ratio of above 3 are most likely to be fibrous in shape, while particles with an aspect ratio of below 1.4 will be largely spherical. Shape variation on plastic particles has been found in all polymers detected, confirming the widely recognized idea that real-world micro-nano plastics have diverse morphological prosperities. This dimension is hard to be resembled by engineered polymer nanoparticles commonly studied in research laboratories, and the toxicological consequences pertaining to real-life plastic particle exposures and their differing physicochemical properties (i.e., size, shape) have yet to be determined.\n6. Discussions and Conclusions\nBy developing the data-driven hyperspectral SRS imaging platform for micro-nano plastic analysis, we describe a methodology to improve nanoparticle detection sensitivity and polymer identification specificity, which has allowed us to start to address the long-lasting knowledge gap of nanoplastics. We estimate that the exposure to the micro-nano plastics from regular bottled water was at the level of 105 particles per liter, which is two to three orders of magnitude more than the previously reported results merely focusing on large microplastics (SI Appendix, Table S4) (58, 59, 61, 69, 70). As it pertains to the estimation of human exposure, these values are substantially higher than those currently reported in the literature (56, 71), which is a result from the newly detected nanoplastic fraction of plastic particulate. The tiny particles previously invisible under conventional imaging actually dominate in number and account for ~90% of the entire population of plastic particles detected. The remaining 10% identified as microplastics have a concentration of around 3 × 104 particles per liter (SI Appendix, Fig. S17), with the majority of them in the size below 2 µm. Larger particles (>2 µm), which are easier to identify under regular optical microscopy, are in the same order of magnitude as the reported microplastic analysis depending on the detection limited reported based on different technologies (SI Appendix, Fig. S17 and Table S4). Our results confirm the plastic fragmentation beyond the micron level by unambiguously detecting nanoplastics in real-life samples. Similar to many other particle size distributions in the natural world, there are substantially more nanoplastics, despite being invisible or unidentified under conventional particle imaging techniques, than previously counted large micron ones. This population of nanoplastics can be easily overlooked in mass quantification as well since nanoparticles with smaller sizes contain cubic-less substances. However, given the capability of these nanoplastic particles to cross the biological barrier, nanoparticles, despite the seemingly trivial contribution to the mass measurement, might play a predominant role in terms of toxicity evaluation (72, 73).\nWe also find many detected particles present SRS spectra that do not match any of the standards. In fact, our small library of seven plastic polymers can only account for roughly about 10% of the total particles/dots imaged under SRS microscopy. A similar level of identification rate is reported in the microplastic analysis in bottled water using vibrational microscopy, indicating the complicated particle composition inside the seemingly simple water sample (SI Appendix, Table S4). In this sense, if we assume all detected organic particles originate from plastics [the same assumption entailed by the quantitative result from SEM-EDX or Nile Red staining (19, 74)], the micro-nano plastic concentration could be as high as 106 particles per liter. However, the common existence of natural organic matter certainly requires prudent distinction from spectroscopy with polymer specificity. Moreover, careful investigation of unidentified particles suggests other aspects that further increase the complexity of identifying chemical composition. For example, some particles exhibit identical features to the characteristic two peaks (C=O ester bond: 1,730 cm−1; C=C double bond: 1,615 cm−1) of the PET in the fingerprint region but present a great variety of vibrational peaks in the high-frequency C–H region (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 a–d). It is unlikely for a polymer material distinct from PET to display both the C=O and C=C vibrational signatures that perfectly match the standard PET spectrum. A more plausible explanation is that they are small heteroaggregates containing PET and other components, with their SRS spectrum being the superposition of the spectrum from each component. Indeed, for some larger ones, we can even capture the spatial chemical heterogeneity within the aggregates (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 a, e, and i). The possible formation of heteroaggregates between nanoplastics or other natural organic matter has long been recognized as a potential challenge in the analysis of nanoplastics and may influence toxicological outcomes within a biological exposure (11). Direct visualization of such heteroaggregates here in real-world samples supports such concerns. For other possible heteroaggregates formed without PET, rigorous identification will require expanding the spectral library and advancing analytical algorithms for SRS microscopy or other vibrational imaging techniques with extended spectral windows to address challenges imposed by massive particle heterogeneity (27, 75, 76).\nAnother important insight is that the particle size distribution varies with the different chemical compositions, suggesting an interconnection between particle morphology and chemical composition. The observed nonorthogonality between plastic composition and particle morphologies challenges the conventional assumption for micro-nano plastics characterization from ensemble measurement. Take the result from brand C analysis as an example, ensemble measurement of micro-nano plastics might suggest that the major substance is PET from compositional analysis and most of the plastic particles have sizes below 500 nm from the morphological analysis. Assuming the two dimensions as being independent properties, people might have an impression that most of the plastic particles in the bottled water from brand C should be PET particles with a size below 500 nm. However, our result from single-particle analysis presents a clear disparity: the sample turns out to contain a small number of PET particles of about micron size and a large number of PS particles with size below 500 nm.\nSuch nonorthogonality might provide valuable information to understand, trace, and eventually prevent possible sources of micro-nano plastic contamination. Specifically in drinking water production, plastic contamination is confirmed in every step from the well to the bottle (77). The discovered size differences among different plastic polymers might indicate precious information about contamination sources during water production. For example, PET and PE, which are used as the packaging material for bottled water for all three brands we analyzed, have similar size distribution patterns, with a major population of micron sizes compared to other polymers. A possible explanation is that some particles of this kind are newly released from the bottle package during transportation or storage, which are retained faithfully in the water sample. Other polymers such as PA, PP, PS, and PVC, which are not the packaging material but also identified with significant numbers, are most likely introduced before or during water production. PP and PA, which share the same broad distribution of sizes, are widely used as equipment components or coagulant aids in water treatment (78). Particularly, PA is the most popular membrane material used in reverse osmosis (79), which is a common water purification method shared by all three brands. PVC and PS, which have a unique size distribution favoring small nanoplastics, might indicate a contamination source even earlier. PVC is identified to be the most abundant polymer type in raw water from microplastic analysis (77). PS is known to be used as backbone material for ion exchange resins in water purification (80). It is possible large particles of PVC or PS get removed by the RO membranes in the later step of the water treatment, leaving mostly nano populations.\nLastly, the interconnection between particle morphology and chemical composition has profound implications for toxicological concerns. As studies with engineered nanoparticles have suggested and investigations of plastic particles are starting to indicate, toxicity induced by micro-nano particles is not only dose-dependent but also related to particle physicochemical characteristics and their effect on cellular interactions and uptake (81, 82). In the case of bottled water from brand C, the cytotoxicity induced by PS nanoplastics plus a small number of PET microplastics would be presumably different from the effect assumed from PET nanoparticles. True comprehensive toxicity evaluation for micro-nano plastics would require multidimensional characterization of plastic particles and the integration of each individual plastic particle regarding their divergent properties on chemical composition and particle morphologies. Single-particle imaging with nanoparticle sensitivity and plastic specificity provides indispensable information to address the rising toxicity concern. Not only it enables plastic particle profiling with accurate exposure quantification, but also it has a unique potential to directly visualize the particle-biology interactions. Therefore, we envision that the data-driven hyperspectral SRS imaging platform will continue bridging the gap of knowledge on plastic pollution at the nano level with an expanded spectral library to study more complicated biological and environmental samples.\n7. Materials and Methods\n7.1. Hyperspectral SRS Microscopy.\nHyperspectral SRS imaging is performed under a commercial system constructed by sending a dual-output femtosecond laser system (InSight X3, Spectra-Physics) through an integrated Spectral Focusing Timing and Recombination Unit (SF-TRU, Newport Corporation) (38) and coupled into a multiphoton laser scanning microscope (FVMPE-RS, Olympus). The instrumentation and imaging condition are described in detail in SI Appendix.\n7.2. Sample Preparation.\nPS standards of micro-nanospheres in different sizes were bought from Thermo Fisher Invitrogen. Microplastic standards of PET, PP, PE, PVC, and PA were obtained by crushing sub-cm-sized plastic pallets into powders through a freeze mill. Particles suspended in RO water are spread and dried on the surface of the coverslip before being embedded with 1% Agarose gel prepared with D2O for SRS imaging. Details are described in SI Appendix.\nTwo bottles of water from the same brand are filtrated through the 0.2-µm pore-sized Anodisc membrane with carefully cleaned glass apparatuses following the procedure described in SI Appendix. The harvest membrane is sandwiched according to Fig. 3B for SRS imaging. The detailed protocol can be found in SI Appendix.\n7.3. Data Analysis.\nThe methods for SRS-tailored spectral matching algorithms, synthetic data generation, and automated micro-nano plastic detection are described in detail in SI Appendix. The corresponding MATLAB codes are available on GitHub through the following link: https://github.com/qnxcarnation/SRS-tailored-Spectral-Matching-algorithm-for-plastic-identification.git.\nData, Materials, and Software Availability\nMATLAB code used for simulation, spectral matching, and plastic analysis; raw imaging data have been deposited in GitHub and Figshare (https://github.com/qnxcarnation/SRS-tailored-Spectral-Matching-algorithm-for-plastic-identification.git (83); and https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24635793.v2) (84).

"Proof read this for spelling/grammar\n\nI had just graduated from UMaine with a degree in Computer Science. I was originally going to be a Kinesiology major, which I arbitrarily picked because I liked bodybuilding. I happened to meet one of my best friends the first year in York Hall, saw him programming in Python, begged him to teach me, and then transferred into Computer Science the next semester. I was very lucky and I instantly knew I’d rather be doing this than anything else I’d seen so far. I was fairly terrified of failing, especially because of the math requirements, but I was stubborn enough that I went ahead anyway.\n\nI was fairly, incredibly obsessed. Looking back, I’m surprised how much time I spent on programming. I discovered Star Trek TNG the summer after my first semester in Computer Science because I would program until 4am every day and I’d see the latest rerun on channel 11, which is how I knew it was time for bed. I recall being incredibly intimidated at the prospect of having to memorize public static void main(String[]: args) for our first Java course (which I did remember). I met an important mentor who essentially served as my muse for improvement — it’s great having an person in your life whose impossible to impress and way beyond your skill level. By the second half of my third year I was starting to feel very confident in my abilities (outside of discreet math). In our final year, I spent 6 months studying via Cracking the Coding Interview, which prepared me very well for my surprise Amazon recruiter call. I did well on the two phone screens, was flown out for 5 more interviews, did well on all but one, and received an offer for $100,000 with a $20,000 sign on bonus. That was probably the happiest day of my life so far since it represented a real “correction” in my life trajectory and secured my future.\n\nI was thrown into the frying pan in the Display Advertising org and almost immediately faced with making a choice about whether or not to move to a greenfield project to create a self service advertising website with one other developer, or remain on the current team to maintain the legacy system. I met with a few people for advice and the unanimous feedback was to switch to the new team. Not only because it was a new project, but also because of some political concerns between the two teams. My colleague would be in charge of the back-end services and I would be in charge of the build and deploy system, and front end libraries. We were building a platform that dozens of other teams were going to leverage to create pages on the website for setting up campaigns, configuring spend, targeting different ad slots, etc. This was truly a sink or swim situation. I was surprised that they would just leave the fate of their future platform up to a random 23 year old.\n\nOverall, this was a fun and exciting period of my life. I met a lot of people, many of whom were around the same age. I got to experience the full evolution of JavaScript from a series of files depending on jQuery to a full fledged, transpiled programming languages with an elaborate build process. I had to learn how to deal with combative coworkers and I had to perform and meet deadlines. This was period of learning the “basics”, both professionally and technically. I also learned that I really like for things to be perfect and how much that would annoy people around me. I toned it down a little over time, but its still a feature.\n\n"
"This too\n\nIt had been three years since joining Amazon. We had launched the website and advertising on Amazon was doing very well. I recall being astounded at the figures being thrown around in our all hands meetings, but I was honestly still impressed and intimidated at the though of a few thousand dollars, let alone millions. Our platform had evolved a lot since its creation, shifting from a series of Backbone scripts that mutate the DOM into a React/ES6 based application built in Webpack. The front end was universally hated by everyone besides front end specialists and I was used to having a long leash because I actually liked the space (and no one else wanted to touch it). I found all of the instability in the JavaScript world to be exciting, but I can imagine how people would have been deterred by it.\n\nThere wasn’t anything that I needed to do for my job that I wasn’t able to do, but there were a lot of things I didn’t know how to do in general that I was insecure about, despite originally feeling that “making buttons” was beneath me and my fancy degree. Most of that was what I considered “back-end” work. I had mostly split my time between the actual front end and the “back of the front end”, which was the thin layer of CRUD services that directly supported the front end, but I didn’t do anything that I needed my fancy degree for. The closest thing to me that I considered “hard” was the real time forecasting system, which I never touched.\n\nThere were a lot of non technical concerns at this time though. The developers, myself included, were growing more disgruntled by the day for not being given the time to correct various parts of the platform that were aging poorly. This boiled over in a mass exodus of developers from the platform. I wasn’t happy about this because I really liked my teammates, but I was also over the internal drama. I learned that it was important to trust the leadership on your team. My mentor was moving to another org as an SDM and I decided to follow him there because I trusted him. Negative sentiments may have been compounded by my irritability from starving at the time. I was competing in my first “real” bodybuilding show (which I won) and I had to deal with walking down to the secret kitchen every 3 hours to microwave fish so no one would yell at me.\n\n"
"I had followed an ambitious friend and mentor who became a manager to my next team on Consumer Engagement. I had a feeling about what went wrong from my first team but I had no idea what to do differently on my next team. My current theory was that the most important part of choosing a role must be trusting the people in charge. I felt very confident in my technical ability within the scope that I tended to work so I wasn’t worried about not being able to perform anywhere that I would try to go. I was still happy working in the front half of the application. I had a lot of niche skills around internal deployment tools and build infrastructure that most developers tended to dislike, which made me attractive and allowed me to have full authority on the things I worked on since no one else wanted to touch them.\n\nI was really coming into my own technically. I had always liked functional programming and I had recently discovered the Elm programming language. It took me over a week to be able to write anything in it but I was very confident that what I was learning would be valuable investments. I would primarily look at what my mentors spent their time doing when deciding what I should be doing myself. The people I respected the most in college implicitly preferred functional programming and Linux, among other tools. I hadn’t forced them to articular how they arrived there but I assumed that they had good reasons. I started to use several of the niche functional transpiled front end languages around this time as well for personal projects, like ClojureScript and PureScript. I absorbed several default technical stances that I still apply today, including immutability, composition over inheritance, absolutely minimal side effects, message passing for concurrency, and preference for coroutines over threads. I was really excited about the things I was learning.\n\nI was learning so much in part because my new role was so boring though. I thought that all of Consumer Engagement could disappear one night and very few customers would actually care. We were building a chat application that no one really asked for and I didn’t think needed to exist. There was one point where there were actual coloring books in the hallways for people on the floor to play with. I thought that if I stayed in that role that I would slowly wither and fade away, though I would continue to improve considerably at super smash bros, our lunch time activity. I learned here that trusting the management isn’t sufficient. My next theory was that you also had to like the product that you were building.\n\n"
"My manager friend was moving to another secret team in Amazon (which would end up being called Amazon Halo, which is now closed). We worked well together and I was ready to leave the current project. I’m into bodybuilding and fitness and I had already been wearing a Fitbit for years. To me, this was the perfect opportunity to see if working on a product you would use yourself would make a difference.\n\nI felt like I was peaking in my technical abilities as well, which meant I had two options: drastically change the types of things that I work on or move to a team where I could apply everything I’ve learned. Halo was perfect for the latter. I was in charge of the entire mobile application, which mean picking everything from frameworks, to build systems, to deployment methods. I was very confident in my ability to do all of that. I ended up picking React Native as the application framework. I was already partial to react from my web experience but I gave the native SDKs a fair chance, creating a toy podcast app for Android/iOS. That application experience convinced me that I didn’t want to have a platform team with the maintenance burden of two native platform frameworks, and I wasn’t impressed with the MVC style patterns. I really liked the functional approach that react took with the virtual DOM and there wasn’t anything that our designers were creating that we couldn’t do in react native. The momentum of the wider front end community was behind react as well. I crated a thin, Makefile based wrapper around internal npm tools and Brazil (Amazon’s internal build system at the time) and set up a deployment pipeline that teams could integrate with to generate installable applications for android and iOS, independent of each other. I was fairly happy with these choices throughout my tenure there.\n\nThere were some regrets though. Using React Native for the component of the application that we called the “data pipeline” ended up being a mistake. This was the code that interacted with our hardware device to filter and aggregate health data packets and upload them to our back-end. I wanted to make sure that the implementation was the same between iOS/Android and the performance benchmarks I was periodically doing at each stage confirmed that speed wouldn’t be an issue. The real issue ended up being reliability though, particularly on iOS. Sometimes react native would get killed, sometimes the app would startup in the background but the react native portion of it wouldn’t. This flakiness lead to ballooning metrics around total sync time since it effectively only reliably worked while foregrounded on iOS. Fortunately we had those metrics, but the pipeline ended up having to be rewritten in native code for launch, which was a hard lesson learned.\n\nThe other lesson I learned at this time was that I really felt uncomfortable with how little every failure seemed to matter. We were told that we were a sort of startup within Amazon, but we were funded with tens of millions of dollars. A lot of our leadership was fresh off of the fire phone failure and it looked like Halo was bound to meet a similar end. We would make hardware mistakes that would cost tens of thousands of dollars to correct but it didn’t really matter because there was always money. Nothing felt anchored to realty and it felt like no failure would matter to anyone who mattered. My theory at this point was that it wasn’t enough to trust your direct leadership because you’d most likely be re-orged away from them anyway. It wasn’t enough to be a real user of the product you were making if you weren’t in control of how it gets created because you can’t have pride in something that you don’t respect. You can’t work in an environment without real accountability for failures if you want your work to be responsive to reality. Halo ended up closing down a few years later and most of the leadership transferred to different orgs within Amazon, having multiple large, failed products under their belt. Many of SDEs, TPMs, and SDMs were placed onto the “sunset” team, doomed to be fired after the product was closed down in 6 months, shouldering the bulk of responsibility for the product failure.\n\n"
"Ultimately, I decided to leave at the start of the pandemic to go to a startup, WhyLabs. I intended to stay for our product launch but it was delayed enough that I wasn’t confident it would come out when it was projected to. At WhyLabs, I was one of less than 10 people and I knew that I would matter a lot. I had connections (direct and indirect) with people who had started the company so I was confident I could trust people. Startups have to earn their funding so I was confident that reality and resources would influence the product and failures would matter. It was outside of Amazon so I would be forced to learn whichever technologies the rest of the world was using to solve problems.\n\nI had mixed confidence in my capabilities for the first time in a while. I remained confident in my front end abilities, and I did contribute there are first, but I was very inexperienced with non-front end tools and frameworks. One of my first projects involved expanding one of our back-end services that used dynamo db for storage. I was fairly intimidated because this was the sort of “back-end” technology that I never got my hands dirty with at Amazon. I did have to learn about eventual consistency the hard way, even when I thought I understood it. All in all, it went smoother than I thought it would.\n\nMy next project involved enabling our containerized whylogs rest API to upload what we call “dataset profiles” to WhyLabs. The container was basically a hack project at this point with a few files. This was the first time I touched anything related to Docker. The container ended up being a great stepping stone because it shared a lot of problems with the data pipeline I built at Halo and I ended up solving those problems with similar solutions inspired by my experience years earlier with the actor model. From there, every project was another technology. Instead of going deep on a single thing for years, I had to jump back and fourth between multiple new frameworks and languages every few weeks. I got really good at getting 85% of proficient in the span of 2–4 weeks for each new project — a skill I value greatly now. The foundation I built at Amazon through a combination of independent study and sink-or-swim project leadership made the transition outside of Amazon smooth. Despite the drama, I’m absolutely grateful for having worked there.\n\nAt this point I’ve confirmed the lessons I learned in the past. You have to trust the leadership of the company you work for. You need to matter a lot in both technical direction and product development. You need to be in an atmosphere where there’s a real and obvious difference between success and failure. The least important thing for me so far as been actually being a part of the target user base of what you’re building, but it isn’t irrelevant by any means. I’ve learned that my strengths have always been my curiosity and my willingness to spend an unreasonable amount of time to do whats “right”. I’ve learned that I love making tools and languages, as well as becoming as expert as I can manage at the tools and languages that others use. These experiences anchor my decision making now and documents like this one help me explain how I ended up here. I’ve learned to lookout for certain red flags. I’ve learned to beware the future when a team starts to make fun of its own product and I still don’t know if it’s too late once it reaches that point.\n\n"
"Based on my experiences, I have a list of things that I think are important to me when deciding to work for a company.\n\nTrusting my leadership is necessary but not sufficient. I need the ability to influence the project and technical direction or I’ll be at the whim of choices beyond my control.\nBeing a user of what I’m building is nice, but not necessary, and definitely not sufficient.\nBeing able to fail and having to earn success is necessary, and maybe sufficient. Without this, no choices matter, no one is accountable, and no one can say that anything ended up better than it would have been otherwise.\nI have default technical stances that I take, with a willingness to abandon them for specific use cases.\n\nEverything is immutable and side effect free. I want to be able to reason about every piece of code knowing these principles hold.\nUsing actors (message passing) to resolve concurrency issues instead of locks. Performance is usually the thing that ends up making me reconsider this, but it’s excellent for most typical use cases in service oriented architectures, and even does fairly well in plenty of performance critical scenarios (like the WhyLabs whylogs container).\nEverything should be as simple and bare as possible. I’ll forgo using a feature rich build tool (like grunt/gulp in the past) in favor of a plain Makefile that I understand to to bottom, and abstractions should be as flat as possible with small surface areas.\nStrong type checking. This is truer now than ever with amazing type checking tools like Pyright and TypeScript.\nI know what I like to work on.\n\nDeveloper tools.\nConcurrency problems.\nDSLs and programming languages.\n"
"WhyLabs\nLead Integrations engineer, responsible for creating various integration methods between our open source library (whylogs, landgkit) and popular services like Snowflake, BigQuery, Dataflow, Kafka, and more.\nA lot of my time went into developing a container based integration solution that served as a fallback integration for anyone who couldn’t use one of our more specific integrations. The container was originally written in Java but was rewritten to be a highly performant Python based REST service for hosting whylogs. A lot of optimizing went into this project because whylogs is CPU bound and the Python GIL exists. In the end, the container has a throughput of 2k tps on an AWS m5.large host, which is quite respectable.\nActor model inspired concurrency solution to work around CPU bound bottlenecks in Python. This is the foundation of the whylogs process rolling logger and the core of the whylogs container — lock free, multiprocessing.\nAmazon\nLead the platform team for Amazon’s burgeoning self service display advertising business. The team was brand new at the time and I was one of two developers on the project. My focus was on creating deployment tools and the front end framework for the various teams who created experiences on the display advertising website.\nWorked in Consumer Engagement to create a chat application on the retail website that users would use to ask and answer questions.\nLead the platform team for the Amazon Halo (fitness band) mobile application. I created all of the initial build and deploy tools and processes for a dozen other teams in the app and was tech lead for the team that maintained and iterated on those tools. I also worked on critical parts of the application, most notably the data pipeline that managed downloading, aggregating, and periodically uploading data from the Halo band.\nI don’t have all the answers yet. I have no idea what I should do next. Things are going a lot better than I thought they would and I feel very fortunate that I started my career in the largest growth decade in history and worked in physical proximity to a lot of excellent people. So I’m playing it by ear and updating these principles along the way.\n\n"

Its goal is to execute all of the things\nthat you do after your first boot, like install packges through your package manager, configure your shell, setup your terminal tools/IDE,\nand install SDKs for various programming languages, without you having to download everything manually and run various scripts in the right\norder.\n\nYou model your setup process as Targets and declare which ones depend on which ones, then execute `booty` to set everything up, if\neverything isn't alrady setup.\n\n<!-- <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddeoa/booty/master/static/booty-status.jpg\"/></p> </br> -->\n\n<a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/7Uv7wuu4AxX96mBvKIYTtefDU\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/7Uv7wuu4AxX96mBvKIYTtefDU.svg\" /></a>\n\n# Install\n\nInstalling from pip\n\n```bash\npip install booty-cli\n```\n\nOr download the appropriate binary from the latest release. This script just downloads it for you and marks it as executable, but you should\nmove it somewhere on your path. The script will drop it in your `pwd`.\n\n```bash\n# Linux\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddeoa/booty/master/scripts/booty-download-linux.sh | bash\n\n# Mac x86\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddeoa/booty/master/scripts/booty-download-mac-x86.sh | bash\n\n# Mac Arm\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddeoa/booty/master/scripts/booty-download-mac-universal.sh | bash\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nYou can run `booty --help` to see all of the options. You'll generally cd to a directory with an `install.booty` file and run `booty`.\nYou'll see a table that shows the status of all of your targets and you'll be prompted to install all of the missing ones, which will\ndisplay in real time as a second table with a row for each target getting setup.\n\n```bash\nUsage: booty_linux_x86_64 [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -c, --config TEXT  Path to the install.sysc file\n  -s, --status       Check the status of all known targets\n  -i, --install      Install all uninstalled targets\n  -y, --yes          Don't prompt for confirmation\n  --help             Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n# Testing/Dry Runs\n\nSetting your system up is inherently side effect prone. Every command from `apt` to `pip` is probably doing something to some part of your\nsystem that you didn't realize. If you want to execute your `install.booty` file without worrying about what might go wrong before you use\nit for real then the best way to do that is via Docker (which is how this repo does \"integration\" testing).\n\nThere is a [public docker image (naddeoa/booty:ubuntu22.04)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/naddeoa/booty/general) that you can\nbase your own Dockerfile on that mimics what a fresh install looks like for Ubuntu 22.04 users. You can create an image that does roughly\nwhat you would do to your system to get the `booty` command working, and then run it and make sure everything works as expected. The image's\nuser is named `myuser` and its password is `password`. You can see how its created in\n[Dockerfile.base](https://github.com/naddeoa/booty/blob/master/Dockerfile.base).\n\nThis Dockerfile is what I use to test my own installs.\n\n```Dockerfile\nfrom naddeoa/booty:ubuntu22.04\n\nRUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddeoa/booty/master/scripts/booty-download-linux.sh | bash # MANUAL install bin directly without pip\n\n# Copy my ssh keys in so I can clone my private repos\nCOPY ./ssh ./.ssh\nRUN sudo chown -R myuser:myuser ./.ssh\nRUN chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa\n\nCOPY ./examples/install.booty ./\n\n# This would be on my path IRL\nENV PATH=\"/home/myuser/.local/bin:${PATH}\"\nRUN booty -i -y\n\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n```\n\nThen you build and run the image, and execute booty.\n\n```bash\n# Build the image\ndocker build . -t my-booty-test\n\n# Run it\ndocker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash my-booty-test\n\n## Inside the image now\n./booty_linux_x86_64 -y\n```\n\nYou can't test everything here but you can get pretty far. One thing I can't test here, for example, is `chsh` because that requires logging\nout, but I gets me confident enough to use it on a fresh install and know I won't mess things up. In practice, you do this sort of a test\ninfrequently, when you initially create your `install.booty` file or when you make big changes to it.\n\n# Syntax Support\n\nA simple syntax definition is available for vim/nvim. This can be placed in `~/.config/nvim/syntax/booty.vim`, for example. This will be\nupdated with a dedicated repo soon.\n\n```vim\nsyntax clear\n\nsyntax region bootyArgs start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=@Spell\nsyntax region bootyParams start=/$((/ end=/))/ contains=@Spell\nsyntax match bootyTargetName \"\\v^\\zs[^ \\t:]+\\ze:.*\"\nsyntax match bootyTargetDependenciesName \"\\v^\\zs[^ \\t]+\\ze\\s+(-\\>|\\<-).*\"\nsyntax match bootyImplementsName \"\\v^\\s+\\zs[^ \\t:]+\\ze:.*\"\nsyntax keyword bootyKeyword recipe setup is_setup\nsyntax match bootyOpDependsOn \"->\"\nsyntax match bootyOpDependedUpon \"<-\"\nsyntax match bootyComment \"^#.*$\"\n\nhighlight link bootyComment Comment\nhighlight link bootyKeyword Keyword\nhighlight link bootyOpDependsOn Operator\nhighlight link bootyOpDependedUpon Operator\nhighlight link bootyTargetName Function\nhighlight link bootyTargetDependenciesName Function\nhighlight link bootyImplementsName Function\nhighlight link bootyRecipeCall Funciton\nhighlight link bootyArgs String\nhighlight link bootyParams Type\n```\n\nAlong with a file type snippet.\n\n```lua\n-- neovim init.lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({\"BufRead\", \"BufNewFile\"}, {\n    pattern = \"*.booty\",\n    command = \"set filetype=booty\",\n})\n```\n\n```vim\n\" vim .vimrc\nautocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.booty set filetype=booty\n```\n\n# Booty Language\n\nFor full examples, check out the [examples](https://github.com/naddeoa/booty/tree/master/examples) folder in github.\n\nThe Booty language is a small language inspired primarily by make, with some additions to better address the problem space. There are a few\ndifferent types of entities.\n\n## Recipes\n\nRecipes are reusable pieces of code that Targets and other Recipes can invoke. You can think of these as classes that implement a `Recipe`\nby defining the `setup` and `is_setup` methods. Recipes are invoked with parameters being separated by commas, like `recipe_name(foo, bar)`.\nParameters can optionally container whitespace as well, meaning `recipe_name(a b c)` is a single parameter `a b c`. The body of the recipe\nmethods consists of one or more executable statements which can either be a line to invoke in shell or another recipe invocation.\n\nThis is a recipe named `apt` who's `setup` executes the shell command `sudo apt-get install -y $((packages))`, where `$((packages))` will be\nsubstituted by the value of the paraemter `packages` when it's run. Its `is_setup` executes a multiline shell statement. The shell is\ninvoked via `bash -c ...`.\n\n```make\nrecipe apt(packages):\n    setup: sudo apt-get install -y $((packages))\n    is_setup:\n      for pkg in $(echo $((packages)) | tr \" \" \"\\n\"); do\n        if ! dpkg -l \"$pkg\" &> /dev/null; then\n          echo \"$pkg is not installed.\"\n          exit 1\n        fi\n      done\n```\n\n## Targets\n\nTargets are the main piece of a booty file. They invoke a recipe to accomplish their goal. This is a target named `essentials` that invokes\nthe `apt`recipe, passing it the paramter `wget git vim autokey-gtk silversearcher-ag gawk xclip`.\n\n```make\nessentials: apt(wget git vim autokey-gtk silversearcher-ag gawk xclip)\n```\n\n## Custom Targets\n\nCustom Targets are similar to recipes, but they're defined inline. You would use this for something that didn't require any code shared\nbetween other recipes. The body of a Custom Target follows the same rules as a Recipe.\n\n```make\npyenv:\n    setup: curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n    is_setup: test -e ~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv\n\n# Can also be multiline and invoke different commands/recipes.\npyenv:\n    setup:\n        apt(python3)\n        curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n    is_setup: test -e ~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nDependencies determine the execution order at setup time. The way that you declare this is flexible. You can use either the `depends on`\nsyntax (`->`) or the `depended upon` syntax (`<-`). This is allowed because its sometimes easier to manage a bunch of dependencies in a\nsingle line when they're logically related. Its personal preference for how you maintain your install.booty file.\n\n```make\n# the target `essentials` is depended upon by foo and bar.\nessentials <- foo bar\n\n# the target `baz` depends on bar.\nbaz -> bar\n```\n\n## Stdlib\n\nCertain recipes are included in booty by default. These include the following.\n\n```make\nrecipe apt(packages):\n    setup: sudo apt-get install -y $((packages))\n    is_setup:\n      for pkg in $(echo $((packages)) | tr \" \" \"\\n\"); do\n        if ! dpkg -l \"$pkg\" &> /dev/null; then\n          echo \"$pkg is not installed.\"\n          exit 1\n        fi\n      done\n\nrecipe pipx(packages):\n    setup: pipx install $((packages))\n    is_setup: pipx list | grep $((packages))\n\n\nrecipe git(repo dist):\n    setup: git clone $((repo)) $((dist))\n    is_setup: test -d $((dist))\n\nrecipe git_shallow(repo dist):\n    setup: git clone --depth 1 $((repo)) $((dist))\n    is_setup: test -d $((dist))\n\nrecipe ln(src dst):\n    setup:\n        mkdir -p $(dirname $((dst)))\n        ln -fs $((src)) $((dst))\n    is_setup: test -L $((dst)) && test -e $((dst))\n\nrecipe cp(src dst):\n    setup:\n        mkdir -p $(dirname $((dst)))\n        cp -r $((src)) $((dst))\n    is_setup: test -e $((dst))\n```\n\nAny of these can be referenced from any booty.install file, and you can redifine them locally if you want different recipe logic that uses\nthe same name.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Why wasn't make good enough?\n\nYou can check the [experiments](https://github.com/naddeoa/booty/blob/master/experiments/install.makefile) folder to see what it looks like\nto implement the [example booty](https://github.com/naddeoa/booty/blob/master/examples/install.boot) file in make. It's a fair bit longer\nand clunkier for a few reasons:\n\n- Every target in make is designed to be an actual file. This great for building things but it means that you end up marking a lot of\n  targets as `.PHONY` if they don't result in differences on the file system.\n- Implementing the `--status` flag from booty is very, very ugly. You'll just manually define two modes of each target and hard code a phony\n  target that runs them all, with no particular attention paid to the output.\n- Same goes for running the setup code -- manually enumerating all targets as a phony target's dependency gets you the `--install` flag in\n  booty.\n- Output in general isn't very digestible.\n- Each line of a target is executed in a new shell. Good for sandboxing commands but it gets very ugly when you want to do something like an\n  `if` statement.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about make though. My favorite relevant parts are:\n\n- Easy, independent dependency specification\n- Plain old shell for each target definition.\n\n# TODO\n\nSome features that might be useful.\n\n- Global variables. This would probably look just like make variables.\n- Block child target installs if a dependency fails first. It will proceed today and most likely fail for that target anyway.\n"

Feel free to rearrange some stuff. This is an overview of my professional life that will be on my about-me page on my site.\n\n- 2013\n    - Graduated college and joined Amazon's display advertising. Had very little real world experience but I was fairly obsessed with\n      learning at this point. I had only a single job interview (Amazon) and I got it on the first try. I kind of judged them for hiring me\n      without realizing I was bad. I had to improve a lot before they realized they made a big mistake and worked a ton to do it.\n    - Quickly faced with the choice of working on their legacy solution or starting the new one. Went with the new team. Was 1 or 2\n      developers tasked with creating the platform for the future display advertising website that dozens of teams would build upon.\n    - Had no professional experience and was fairly insecure in my ability. Thought it was kind of crazy that they would put me in charge of\n      this. I remember feeling a similar way when they aksed me to start interviewing. I felt I had just barely slipped by msyelf and I\n      didn't have much ground to stand on to interview others from.\n    - The only real goals that I had wre t ofigure out what I needed to be good at and to become better than everone else around me at them.\n      The things that came naturally here were havinga high quality bar and making things perfect. Things that weren't natural were working\n      \"fast\".\n\n- 2016\n    - Promoted to sde2, which I was pretty excited about. The team had be reorged several times but there were a core of developrers who\n      stuck together for years. This was a really fun time where I was mostly surrounded by people I enjoyed working and spending time with.\n      I felt like I was very productive and I thought everyone around me agreed, I felt the same way about 80% of the people I worked with.\n      The front end developer UX was changing extremely fast and the tools that we picked for our team were already dated (Tomcat, JSP,\n      Backbone) and I was anxious to remain ontop of the changing landscape.\n    - There wasn't anything that I needed to do for my job that I wasn't able to do, but there were a lot of things I didn't know how to do\n      in general that I was insecure about. Most of that was what I considered \"backend\" work. I had mostly split my time between the actual\n      front end and the \"back of the front end\", which was the thin layer of CRUD services that directly supported the front end, but I\n      didn't do anything that I needed my fancy degree for. The closest thing to me that I considered \"hard\" was the real time forecasting\n      system, which I never touched.\n    - The team ended up disbanding in a sudden exodus. This was the first time I saw this pattern at Amazon and I learned the importance of\n      trusting leadership and having influence. In the end, the team ended up growing very fast in a very short period of time and the\n      developers all felt we didn't understand the product choices that were being made. We found ourselves making jokes about how bad the\n      product was as a sort of coping mechanism for not having the time that we wanted to make the changes we felt would allow us to respect\n      the work we were doing. Eventually there was a mass exodus of developers to other teams/orgs.\n\n- 2017\n    - I had followed an ambitious friend and mentor who became a manager to my next team on Consumer Engagement. I had a feeling about what\n      went wrong from my first team but I had no idea what to do differently on my next team. My current theory was that the most important\n      part of chosing a role must be trusting the people in charge. I felt very confident in my technical ability within the scope that I\n      tended to work so I wasn't worried about not being able to perform anywhere that I was attempt going. I was still happy working in the\n      front half of the application. I had a lot of niche skills around internal deployment tools and build infrastructure that most\n      developers tended to dislike, which made me attractive and allowed me to have full authority on the things I worked on since no one\n      else wanted to touch them.\n    - I was really coming into my own technically. I had always liked functional programming and I had recently discovered the Elm\n      programming language. It took me over a week to be able to write anything in it but I was very confident that the things I would learn\n      by doing that exercise would be valuable investments. I would primarily look at what my mentors spent their time doing when deciding\n      what I should be doing myself. The people respected the most in college implicitly prefered functional programming and linux, among\n      other tools. I hadn't forced them to articular how they arrived there but I assumed that they had good reasons. I started to use all\n      several of the niche functional transpiled languages around this time as well for personal projects, like clojurescript and\n      purescript. I abosrbed several default technical stances that I still apply today, including immutability, composition over\n      inheritance, absolutely minimal side effects, message passing for concurrency, and preference for coroutines over threads. I was\n      really excited about the things I was learning.\n    - I was learnng so much in part because my new role was so boring though. I thought that all of Consumer Engagement could dissapear one\n      night and very few customers would actually care. We were building a chat applicatin that no one really asked for and I didn't think\n      needed to exist. There was one point where there were actual coloring books in the hallways for people on the floor to play with. I\n      thought that if I stayed in that role that I would slowly wither and fade away, though I would continue to improve considerably at\n      super smash bros, our lunch time activity. I learned here that trusting the management isn't sufficient. My next theory was that you\n      also had to like the product that you were building.\n\n- 2018\n    - My manager friend was moving to another secret team in Amazon (which would end up being called Amazon Halo, which is now closed). We\n      worked well together and I was ready to leave the current team. I'm into bodybuilding and fitness and I had already been wearing a\n      ftibit for years. To me, this was the perfect opportunity to see if working on a product you would use yourself would make a\n      difference.\n    - I felt like I was peaking in my technical abilities as well, which meant I had two options. Drastically change the types of things\n      that I work on or move to a team where I could apply everything I've learned. Halo was perfect for the latter. I was in charge of the\n      entire mobile application, which mean picking everything from frameworks, to build systems, to deployment methods. I was very\n      confident in my ability to do all of that. I ended up picking React Native as the application framework. I was already partial to\n      react from my web experience but I gave the native SDKs a fair chance, creating a toy podcast app for Android/iOS. That toy\n      application experience convinced me that I didn't want to have a platform team with the maintenance burden of two native paltform\n      frameworks, and I wasn't impressed with the MVC style patterns. I really liked the functional appraoch that react took with the\n      virtual dom and there wasn't anything that our designers were creating that we couldn't do in react native. The momentum of the wider\n      FE community was behind react as well. I crated a thin, Makefile based wrapper around internal npm tools and brazil (Amazon's internal\n      build system at the time) and set up a deployment pipeline that teams could integrate with to generate installable applications for\n      android and iOS, independent of each other. I was fairly happy with these choices throughout my tenure there.\n    - There were some regrets though. Using React Native for the component of the application that we called the \"data pipeline\" ended up\n      being a mistake. This was the code that interacted with our hardware device to filter and aggregate health data packets and upload\n      them to our backend. I wanted to make sure that the implementation was the same between ios/android and the performance benchmarks I\n      was periodically doing at each stage confirmed that speed wouldn't be an issue. The real issue ended up being reliability though,\n      especially on iOS. Sometimes react native would get killed, sometimes the app would startup in the background but the react native\n      portion of it wouldn't. This flakiness lead to balooning metrics around total sync time since it effetively only reliably worked while\n      foregrounded on iOS. Fortunately we had those metrics. The pipeline ended up having to be reweritten in native code for launch, which\n      was a hard lesson learned.\n    - The other lesson I learned at this time was that I really felt uncomfortable with how little every failure seemed to matter. We were\n      told that we were a sort of startup within Amazon, but we were funded with tens of millions of dollars. A lot of our leadership was\n      fresh off of the fire phone failure and it looked like Halo was bound to meet a similar end. We would make hardware mistakes that\n      would potentially cost tens of thousands of dollars to correct but it didn't really matter because there was always money. Nothing\n      felt anchored to realty and it felt like no failure would matter to anyone who mattered. My theory at this point was that it wasn't\n      enough to trust your directly leadership because you'd most likely be re-orged away from them anyway, it wasn't enough to be a\n      real user of the product you were making if you weren't in control of how it gets created because you can't have pride in something\n      that you see failing, and you can't work in an environment without real accountability for failures if you want your work to be\n      responsive to reality. Halo ended up closing down a few years later and most of the leadership transfered to different orgs within\n      Amazon, having multiple large, failed products under their belt. Many of SDEs, TPMs, and SDMs were placed onto the \"sunset\" team,\n      doomed to be fired after the product was closed down in 6 months, shouldering the bulk of responsibility for the product failure.\n\n- 2020\n    - Ultimately, I decided to leave at the start of covid to go to a startup, WhyLabs. I intended to stay for our product launch but it was\n      delayed enough that I wasn't confident it would come out when it was projected to. I was one of less than 10 people and I knew that I\n      would matter a lot. I had connections (direct and indirect) with people who had started the company so I was confident I could trust\n      people. Startups have to earn their funding so I was confident that reality and resources would influence the product, and failures\n      would matter. It was outside of Amazon so I would be forced to learn whichever technologies the rest of the world was using to solve\n      problems. \n    - I had mixed confidence in my capabilities for the first time in a while. I remained confident in my front end abilities, and I did\n      contribute there are first, but I was very inexperienced with non-front end tools and frameworks. One of my first projects involved\n      expanding one of our backend services that used dynamo db for storage. I was fairly intimidated because this was the sort of \"back\n      end\" technology that I never got my hands dirty with at Amazon. I did have to learn about eventual consistency the hard way, even when\n      I thought I understood it. A few apis ended up having small consistency issues. All in all, it went smoother than I thought it would.\n      My next project involved enabling our containerized whylogs rest api to upload what we call \"dataset profiles\" to whylabs. The\n      container was basicaly a hack project at this point with a few files. This was the first time I touched anything related to Docker.\n      The container ended up being a great stepping stone because it shared a lot of problems with the data pipeline I built at Halo and I\n      ended up solving those problems with similar solutions inspired by my experience years earlier with the actor model. From there, every\n      project was another technology. Instead of going deep on a single thing for years, I had to jump back and fourth between multiple new\n      frameworks and languages every few weeks. I got really good at getting 85% of proficient in the span of 2 - 4 weeks for each new\n      project -- A skill I value greatly now. The foundation I built at Amazon through a combination of independeant study and sink-or-swim\n      project leadership made the transition outside of Amazon smooth.\n    - At this point I've confirmed the lessons I learned in the past. You have to trust the leadership of the company you\n      work for. You need to matter a lot in both technical direction and prodcuct development. You need to be in an atmosphere where there's\n      a real and obvious difference between success and failure. The least important thing for me so far as been actually being a dedicated\n      part of the target user base of what you're building, but it isn't irrelevant by any means. I've learned that my strengths have always\n      been my curiosity, my willingness to spend an unreasonable amount of time on what some might consider esoteric minutia. I've learned\n      that I love making tools and languages, as well as becoming as expert as I can manage at the tools and languages that others use. All\n      of this gives me a reason to.\n\n      I've learned to lookout for certain red flags. I've learned to beware the future when a team starts to make fun of its own product and\n      I don't know if it's too late once it reaches that point. \n"

Pipe is just too slow.\n\nclass PipeSignaler(th.Thread):\n    \"\"\"\n    A thread that listens on a pipe for messages and signals the corresponding futures.\n\n    This class is used in the process logger to enable synchronous logging requests across processes.\n    It's essentially a dictionary of futures that are registered by the main process and signaled by the\n    child process. A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids may be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids mmay be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

"good job. Some clarifications: commands don't exist, there is a recipe and a recipe (kind of like a class/interface) has functions you need to implement, like setup, and is_setup. So those always exist in a recipe "
"what's the best way of making a comment able to appear anywhere"
"some changes:\n\n- dependencies are top level, not part of a target. Move them so that start can be a recipe | target | dependency\n- don't worry about comments, just remove them from the grammar\n"
"target's can also look similar to recipes. For example:\n\npyenv:\n    setup: \n        apt(build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev \n            libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev \n            libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev tk-dev libffi-dev)\n        curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n    is_setup: which pyenv\n\nThis is a target that's kind of like an anonymous class. Instead of invoking a recipe it implements one directly without makingit available as a recipe to others"
"for recipe_content, I think we have to break it out and create rules for setup and is_setup. The body of those things is efefectively multiline, shell commands. You know the body is over by indentation rules"
"I'm in a bit of a pickle here and I need recommendations. The grammar as a whole doesn't care about whitespace, which I like, but the recipe setup/is_setup does care abotu white space. That  complicates the language because I can't just ignore all whitespace, but I don't want the shell code to be verbose to write."
"ok I'm going to add a token to mark the end of that body instead of using whitespace.

In that case it's either a single recipe invocation or a shell command\n- if setup/is_setup is multiple lines then it does require the end delimiter (a ; by itself on a line) and it is a series of recipe invocations/shell commands "

A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids mmay be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids mmay be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids mmay be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

"Can you summarize this document for me\n\nSnowflake\n\nThe Snowflake integration works by leveraging our Python UDFs in your environment. There isn't an automatic setup or native Snowflake application yet. After the whylogs and WhyLabs UDFs have been set up, you'll profile and upload data through SQL queries that leverage the UDFs.\nSetup\n\nMake sure snowsql is set up with with a default schema, database, and warehouse so you can execute sql statements directly via stdin if you're following along with the examples. If you already have your snowsql configured appropriately then you can skip this, it's just for demonstration.\n\ncreate database whylogs_integration_db;\ncreate warehouse whylogs_integration_warehouse;\n\n# So you can pipe things to snowsql on the command line\n[connections]\n# ....\nwarehousename = whylogs_integration_warehouse\ndbname = whylogs_integration_db\nschemaname = public\n\nAllow Conda Packages\n\nFollow the Snowflake instructions for enabling the use of third party packages. You'll be using whylogs as a Python UDF from the private Snowflake conda repo and it's disabled by default until you complete their form.\nCreate Secrets (Configuration)\n\nSecrets are used to supply the WhyLabs API key, as well as some other configuration parameters that influence profiling. All of your credentials can be generated in your WhyLabs account settings. This is the only part that you have to manually edit since it's specific to your account. The other instructions work for any account.\n\n    ⚠️ The whylogs version in Snowflake does't understand our new API key format yet. If you generate an api key that has :org-12345 at he end of it then you'll have to remove that until our new version is published.\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE SECRET whylabs_api_key\n  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING\n  SECRET_STRING = 'xxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE SECRET whylabs_org_id\n  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING\n  SECRET_STRING = 'org-xxxxx';\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE SECRET whylabs_dataset_id\n  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING\n  SECRET_STRING = 'model-xx';\n\n-- Which columns to segment your data on, if any. Must be all caps, csv.\n-- Leave blank if you don't want to segment.\n-- Example: '' for no segments, 'STATE,CITY' for two segments, etc.\nCREATE OR REPLACE SECRET segment_columns\n  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING\n  SECRET_STRING = 'STATE';\n\n-- Defaults to Day (D). Can be anything that Pandas grouper understands.\nCREATE OR REPLACE SECRET data_grouper_freq\n  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING\n  SECRET_STRING = 'D' -- 'D' for day or 'H' for hour\n;\n\nQuick Install\nSQL Script\n\nEach version of the Snowflake integration is published along side a sql setup script that you can use to create all of the resources you need in your Snowflake account. You can download this script and execute it with snowsql\n\ncurl https://whylabs-snowflake-udfs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/udfs/v1/latest/setup.sql | snowsql\n\nTerraform\n\nComing soon.\nManual Install\n\nThe setup will use Snowflake sql files in our github repo. You can check that out now or copy and paste the commands as you go.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/whylabs/whylabs-snowflake-integration.git\ncd ./whylabs-snowflake-integration/sql\n\nCreate Network Rule\n\nYou need two network rules. One network rule allows the WhyLabs Upload UDF to connect to WhyLabs. The other rule doesn't actually provide any network access but is required by the Snowflake in order to access secrets, which the whylogs UDF needs for configuration.\n\nsnowsql -f ./networking.sql\n\nCreate External Integration\n\nThe integrations are what tell Snowflake what each of the UDFs have access to in terms of network and secrets.\n\nsnowsql -f ./integrations.sql\n\nCreate Stage Integration\n\nThis will set up your account to be able to use the public bucket that WhyLabs uses to distribute our UDFs.\n\nsnowsql -f ./storage.sql\n\nCreate UDFs\n\nThis will create the UDFs in your account, referencing the python source from our readonly public bucket.\n\nsnowsql -f ./create-udf.sql\n\nIf you want to get a hold of the UDF source for any particular release then you can view the releases page on the GitHub repository.\nSpecific Version\n\nIf you want to use a specific version of the UDFs rather than the latest one that we publish then you can use this format instead, where RELEASE_SHA is the release tag that you want to use from the releases page.\n\ncreate or replace function whylogs(data object)\n    -- ...\n    handler = 'whylogs_udf.handler'\n    imports = ('@whylabs_udf_stage/v1/archive/RELEASE_SHA/whylogs_udf.py') -- This is different\n;\n\ncreate or replace function whylabs_upload(profile_view varchar, segment_partition varchar, segment varchar)\n    returns table (upload_result varchar)\n    -- ...\n    handler = 'whylabs_upload_udf.handler'\n    imports = ('@whylabs_udf_stage/v1/archive/RELEASE_SHA/whylabs_upload_udf.py') -- This is different\n;\n\nUsage\n\nNow you'll be abe to use the whylogs and whylabs_upload functions in your SQL queries. The UDFs have to be used in queries in conjunction with partitioning. There are some gotchas with partition size unfortunately. If the partition sizes are too large then the UDF will hit an Out of Memory error. When this happens, you'll have to add extra columns to the partition statement\nOptional - Dummy Data\n\nIf you want to recreate the tables used in the example queries for testing then follow this section. This script will create a warehouse, database, and table, populated with dummy data. Ths will take about a minute to finish.\n\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whylabs/whylabs-snowflake-integration/master/sql/create-dummy-data.sql | snowsql\n\nProfile Data\n\nThis example shows how to profile a table that you intend to segment on STATE (representing th US state).\n\nselect profile_view, segment_partition, segment, rows_processed, debug_info \nfrom \n    (\n        select \n            date_trunc('DAY', hire_date) as day,\n            state,\n            object_insert(object_construct(*), 'DATASET_TIMESTAMP', date_part(EPOCH_MILLISECONDS, hire_date)) as data\n        from employees \n        where day='2023-09-20 00:00:00.000'::timestamp\n    )\n    ,\n    table(whylogs(data) over (partition by day, state))\n;\n\nThe results will look like this.\nPROFILE_VIEW\tSEGMENT_PARTITION\tSEGMENT\tROWS_PROCESSED\tDEBUG_INFO\nV0hZMQCRBAoOILCT55K...\tSTATE\t...\t52224\tnorm_time: 0.179 ...\nV0hZMQCRBAoOIOWu55K...\tSTATE\t...\t44032\tnorm_time: 0.144 ...\nV0hZMQCRBAoOIPLG55K...\tSTATE\t...\t48128\tnorm_time: 0.153 ...\nV0hZMQCRBAoOIMvg55K...\tSTATE\t...\t41984\tnorm_time: 0.156 ...\n\nSome information on the returned columns.\n\n    The PROFILE_VIEW column is a base64 encoded version of the generated whylogs profile for that partition. The\n    The SEGMENT_PARTITION column is the name of the column that was used to segment the data. In this case it's STATE.\n    The SEGMENT column is the value of the segment. It's base64 encoded, but it specifies the specific segment for that profile.\n    The ROWS_PROCESSED column is the number of rows that were processed for that profile.\n    The DEBUG_INFO column is a string that contains some debug information about the profiling process. It's useful for troubleshooting.\n\nThe input to whylogs() is an object that contains the data that you want to profile. The object_insert function is used to add a DATASET_TIMESTAMP field to the object. This is used by whylogs to determine the timestamp of the data. Having a DATASET_TIMESTAMP is required, and the format should be a TIMESTAMP_NTZ (whylogs will assume UTC internally).\nPartition Optimization\n\nThe partitioning should line up with the aggregation mode (day, hour, etc.), and the segments you're using. If you start hitting Out of Memory errors and you have nothing left to partition on then you can add arbitrary numbers that serve as uniform partitions, like so.\n\nselect profile_view, segment_partition, segment, rows_processed, debug_info \nfrom \n    (\n        select \n            date_trunc('DAY', hire_date) as day,\n            state,\n            object_insert(object_construct(*), 'DATASET_TIMESTAMP', date_part(EPOCH_MILLISECONDS, hire_date)) as data,\n            FLOOR(ABS(UNIFORM(0, 9, RANDOM()))) as rand\n        from employees \n        where day='2023-09-20 00:00:00.000'::timestamp\n    )\n    ,\n    table(whylogs(data) over (partition by day, state, rand)) -- Additional level of partitioning\n;\n\nYou'll end up generating more models now, but you you'll reduce the amount of data that each UDF has to process. Only do this if you hit an error though.\nUpload Data\n\nThe second UDF (whylabs_upload()) is for uploading the profiles that are generated by the first UDF (whylogs()).\n\nwith \n    profiles as (\n        select day, state, profile_view, segment_partition, segment, rows_processed, debug_info\n        from \n            (\n                select \n                    date_trunc('DAY', hire_date) as day,\n                    state,\n                    object_insert(object_construct(*), 'DATASET_TIMESTAMP', date_part(EPOCH_MILLISECONDS, hire_date)) as data \n                from employees\n                where day = '2023-09-10 00:00:00.000'::timestamp\n            )\n            ,\n            table(whylogs(data) over (partition by day, state))\n)\nselect upload_result \nfrom \n    profiles\n    ,\n    table(whylabs_upload(profile_view, segment_partition, segment) over (partition by day, state))\n;\n\nThis query is essentially the profile query, wrapped in a with block, and then fed into a second query that uses whylabs_upload(). You can default to keeping the partitioning the same for the upload, but you have some flexibility here. In this example, the upload UDF is launched once for every profile result."
"Summarize this code \n\n\"\"\"\nMessages that the process logger can process.\n\nThese types are core types that you can send to the process logger. They are either subclasses of\nTypedDict or wrappers around serialized byte versions of those dicts. Everything in here is a\nTypedDict because we use orjson to deserialize them for performance reasons and that library prefers\nto output everything as dictionaries.\n\nThe dataclass containers for those messages have helper methods to extract/deserialize the dicts. It's\nimportant to not raise exceptions in those data classes because the actor does a lot of large batch processing\nand exceptions would result in losing the entire batch. Instead, they return None and log errors if there is\nsome issue deserializing or validating.\n\"\"\"\nimport sys\n\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 8):\n    from typing import TypedDict  # pylint:

A lot of the behavior is implicit because it involves properties of processes, so it's\n    worth documenting here.\n\n    - This thread has to be started from the main process, which means it has to be started right before the\n        process logger is started (before the os.fork under the hood). It has to be started from the main process\n        because the main process will be registering futures on it, and those can't cross the process boundary.\n    - The parent and child process each have references to the pipes and they each need to close their references,\n        which means close_child has to be called from the child process and close has to be called from the parent.\n        Calling close_child in the main processing code will have right effect.\n    - The process actor does message batching so multiple ids mmay be signaled even though a single batch was processed\n        because that batch could have contained multiple messages.\n    - The signaler uses Events under the hood to know when to stop working. They can be th.Events even though this\n        is being used in a multiprocessing environment because nothing the child does can affect them. Keep in mind\n        that introducing any behavior on the child side that depends on knowing whether those events are set won't work\n        though, they would have to be switched to mp.Events for that.\n\n    This class should really never be used by anyone in most cases.

"can you help me understand attention? By what mechanism does \"attention\" force the model to pay attention to certain regions in images"
"ok lets go lighter on analogy and reference the speicifc processes more. You said weights are assigned to the patches. Why do those weights result in attention being paid in different amounts downstream on the model? Can I assume higher weights mean more at tention?"
"so, if the center of an image is the most important, the outside of the image, in an attention layer, will have low, maybe 0, weights, which ultimately end up in very low low values for those regions (in a classification model for example) which will contribute very little to the final prediction of the network because they're so low?"
"but when we're talking about image generation, like in a gan, if the gan works off of -1,1 normalized images, what impact can attention have on the network downstream? Does it just start lowering some of the features in that giant high dimensional space? How do you reason about it outside of classification"
"but how does it \"emphasize\" things? Lilke, in classification, it says \"don't pay attention to these\" by making the weights very low and making their final c ontribution small. "
"but how do the low weighted features get neglected? In classification, they're neglected because you do some weighted some and they contribute less in the end of the network to that sum, because t hey're smaller. But the output of a generator is an image"
"so if a pixel gets more \"attention\" what does it really mean? It's not like more compute is dedicated to it. Why would that be a good thing?"
"oh so if my model generates animals and its currently generating an animal with no eyes then all of the features that represent eyes would contribute very little after the attention layers"

"so if I do a transpose convolution on an an input of size (64x64x32 channels), and my kernel size is 4x4, and my stride is 2x2, with no padding, the first deconvolution will operate on the top left square of 16 pixels and use all 32 channels to determine how to upsample that 16 pixel grid?"

"do you know about the ui library mantine?"

"I'd like to have you run some simulations in a game. Here are the rules:\n\n- You play as a particular class with a collection of abilities\n- There some abilities take time to cast\n- There is a concept known as the Global Cooldown (GCD) that happens after most spells and lasts 1.5 seconds. For that time you can't perform any other actions/abilities.\n- There are some number of enemies that you can target.\n- Depending on the class, there are resources you have to manage.\n\nFor now, we'll use the Warrior class as an example. Here is how warriors work:\n\n- They have a resources called Rage that goes from 0 to 100. Some abilities cost rage and some build rage.\n- Warriors are melee characters. Melee characters perform what is called Auto Attacks on a set cadence depending on their weapon. Let's assume this warrior's auto attack speed is 2.6 seconds, which means he performs an auto attack every 2.6 seconds which builds 30 rage.\n- Warriors have these abilities: \n-- Slam. Costs 15 rage. Deals 40 damage. Has no cooldown.\n-- Mortal Strike. Costs 30 rage. Deals 90 damage. Has a 8 second cooldown.\n\nAssuming you are only fighting a single enemy, can you tell me how much damage you would deal to that enemy over a 2 minute period with these rules?"
"Can you account for the GCD as well? Show me a sample sequence of events for a 30 second fight."
"I forgot to tell you a rule sorry. Auto attacks don't trigger the GCD, they happen automatically all the time without regard to the GCD. They're special in that way."
"Why does mortal strike happen at 1.5 seconds?"
"why don't the auto attacks happen every 2.6 seconds?"
"Let's change the format up. Instead of a list, can you give me the results as a table with these columns: Time, Ability Name, Rage Before, Rage After, Damage Done, Cumulative Damage Done, Damage per second so far."
"Two issues. One is my fault and one is yours. \n\nMy fault: I didn't tell you that auto attacks deal damage too. Auto attacks deal 20 damage.\n\nYour fault: You still aren't making auto attacks happen every 2.6 seconds. You start off right but then you mess it up. For example, you have an auto attack at 8.4 seconds in the previous example, right after an auto attack at 5.2 seconds. But It should have happened at 5.2+2.6 seconds, which is 7.8, not 8.4. "
"That's great! You did a lot better than gpt3. Sanity check: Can you tell me how much Damage per second (DPS) you would do in a 2 minute fight with these rules and abilities? You don't have to show every event this time, just give me the dps."
"Can you give me the dps for a 19 second fight?"
"The problem with the approach that you're taking is that it doesn't account for resources (rage) and GCD. Can you try again but this time arrive to the answer by performing a step by step simulation like we did before where you calculate the rage, damage, dps, etc after each ability? You don't have to show me the entire sequence this time, just perform it internally and tell me how much dps at the end of 19 seconds."
"You're calculating DPS manually after running the simulation, you aren't using the simulation to generate the DPS. You can't just calculate DPS naively like that, you have to take it from the sequence instead. To make it easier, use the table format I described earlier, then you'll have the dps at every step"
"Finish that sentence, you just stopped without giving the DPS number"
"Yes, that's perfect. This is how you calculate DPS, by performing a step by step simulation. Ok, Let's do that again but add another ability called Overpower. Overpower doesn't trigger the GCD either. It has a 4 second cooldown and it generates 15 rage and deals 20 damage. "
"Slam isn't affected by the GCD, so you can do it every 4 seconds, similar to how auto attacks happen every 2.6 seconds."
"Overpower should happen at time 0 along with Auto Attack and Mortal Strike because it isn't affected by the GCD. "
"Finish the table please. You stopped half way through the row with a time of 18.2 seconds"
"Great thank you. Can you give me a pie chart that shows the damage contribution of each ability, in svg format?"
"Ok, let's add a new concept. Now, Overpower will also hit a second target, in addition to the primary target. Let's run the simulation again with two targets instead of one. And let's add a Targets Hit column as well so we know which abilities hit multiple targets. Instead of Damage Done column, we'll use Damage Done (Main) which shows the damage on the main target, and a column Damage Done (Total) which adds up the damage on all targets if multiple were hit."
"Rage cannot exceed 100. Any rage that you build beyond 100 will be wasted."
"Why do you just stop writing the table sometimes? Did I hit an api limit?"
"Rather than showing me every event, can you do the simulation silently and just give me the DPS at the end?"
"What about for a 2 minute fight"
"Can you show me a table with the damage contribution of each ability for that two minute fight"
"That isn't true, overpower hits the primary target AND a secondary target"
"That's good, except Auto Attack, Mortal Strike, and Slam don't hit multiple targets, only the main target"
"Can you show me a table that shows how much damage each target took?"
"I'm going to start defining the abilities and their properties in CSV format. Can you rerun the simulation assuming warriors have these abilities now. There is a new concept here called Charges. If a spell has two charges then it can be used twice in a row even though it has a cooldown of 4 seconds, for example. The 4 second cooldown just determines how long it takes to recover a single charge of the spell.\n\nAbility name,rage cost,rage generation,cool down (seconds),damage,charges,on gcd\nmortal strike,30,0,6,200,1,TRUE\nover power,10,0,4,100,2,TRUE\nslam,15,0,0,80,1,TRUE\nauto attack,0,20,2.6,20,n/a,FALSE"
"Can you show me a sample sequence of that simulation, up to 20 seconds?"
"You have some of the rage costs wrong"
"Can you use all of the values From this CSV for abilities? I think you're using some from our past conversation. The rage cost of mortal strike is 30 not 20.\n\nAbility name,rage cost,rage generation,cool down (seconds),damage,charges,on gcd\nmortal strike,30,0,6,200,1,TRUE\nover power,10,0,4,100,2,TRUE\nslam,15,0,0,80,1,TRUE\nauto attack,0,20,2.6,20,n/a,FALSE\n"
"You can't use mortal strike if you don't have enough rage"
"Why didn't you use overpower the moment you could?"
"Why did you use overpower before Mortal Strike when you had enough rage to use mortal strike? Isn't it more damage to use Mortal Strike? "
"Why is mortal strike used at 4 seconds?"
"Why did you use overpower at 4 seconds?"
"This is an honest question, I'm not implying you're wrong. Why did you use mortal strike at 6 seconds?"
"Since the global cooldown is 1.5 seconds and it is triggered off of every ability that is on the CGD, the next ability that you can manually use after Overpower at 2.6 seconds would happen at 4.1 seconds."
"Can you help me generate a python notebook that walks someone through summarizing a dataset using whylogs?"
"Can you run simulations and give me results?"
"I want to run damage simulations for World of Warcraft. Usually this is done with a program called simc that executes abilities for a given class, for a given period of time, and reports on the average damage per second that class would have done."
"Let's pretend we're playing a game. In this game, you have abilities that do a certain amount of damage but they also have cooldowns, which means you can't just use them forever. Let's say you have one ability called Mortal Strike, with a six second cooldown, which does 117 damage. If you enter combat for 2 minutes and use Mortal Strike as much as you can, how much damage per second will you do?"
"Let's say you have another ability called Overpower, which does 80 damage and it has a 4 second cooldown. How much damage per second would you do in two minutes now?"
"Let's say that overpower has two charges. So you can use it as many times as you have charges for it but you only get one charge back every 4 seconds."
"Let's introduce a concept of a global cooldown. Every time you execute an ability you trigger the global cooldown, which is 1.5 seconds. For example, you can't use Mortal Strike and Overpower at the same time because they each trigger the Global cooldown (GCD), you have to wait 1.5 seconds between each ability. How much damage do you do over two minutes now?"
"Let's add the concept of auto attacks. This damage just happens without regard for the global cooldown all the time, but no action is required specifically. Let's say auto attacks happen every 2.6 seconds and deal 20 damage. How much damage would you do then?"
"Let's introduce a concept called Rage. Rage is built up and spent on abilities. Auto attacks generate 30 rage and there is a maximum of 100 rage that you can have at a time. Mortal strike costs 30 rage and overpower costs 20 rage.  You start with 0 rage. How much damage would you do then?"
"How long would you spend waiting for rage to generate?"
"Why did you say that Overpower has 5 charges?"
"Ok, let's assume overpower has 2 charges still. That implies that you don't want to let it sit at two charges because you're potentially wasting overpower uses you could have had. Does that change anything?"
"Could I give you a list of abilities, with their rage cost and their rage generation and have you rerun the calculations?"
"What format would you prefer for a table? Can I use a CSV?"
"Ability name,rage cost,rage generation,cool down (seconds),damage,charges,on gcd\nmortal strike,30,0,6,200,1,TRUE\nover power,10,0,4,100,2,TRUE\nslam,,,,,,TRUE\nauto attack,0,30,2.6,40,n/a,FALSE\n"
"Try with these values"
"Ability name,rage cost,rage generation,cool down (seconds),damage,charges,on gcd\nmortal strike,30,0,6,200,1,TRUE\nover power,10,0,4,100,2,TRUE\nslam,15,0,0,80,1,TRUE\nauto attack,0,30,2.6,40,n/a,FALSE\n"
"Can you give me a sample sequence of events with timestamps for a two minute period?"
"Why did you stop before two minutes?"
"You claim you stopped at 1 minute and 57.5 second sbut the last bullet point I see is 46.00s"
"Ok let's try another with the following table. This time, let's assume that auto attacks happen every 2.6 seconds all the time, regardless of global cooldown, and generate 30 rage\n\nAbility name,rage cost,rage generation,cool down (seconds),damage,charges,on gcd\nmortal strike,30,0,6,200,1,TRUE\nover power,10,0,4,100,2,TRUE\nslam,15,0,0,80,1,TRUE\n"
"Why does Mortal Strike happen at 5.2 seconds instead of shortly after 2.6 seconds?"
"But it was never used up until this point, it's the first use"
"That looks better, but can you include all auto attack events too? You leave out the auto attack that happens at 2.6 seconds because it happens at the same time as mortal strike, but I'd like to see it right before"
"Can you repeat that list with numbers instead of bullets so we can reference them more easily"
"Use numbers instead of bullets, but also include the timestamp"
"You didn't include the time stamps"
"Can you include the timestamp at the beginning of each line instead of the end"
"Can you do this in table form with the following columns: Timestamp, Ability, Rage before, Rage after, Damage done"
"The auto attacks aren't right. Why aren't they happening every 2.6 seconds? "
"Why does the third auto attack happen at 6.7s instead of 5.2?"
"Why do you think the previous auto attack happened at 4.3s? Your table says it happened at 2.6s"
"Do you see additional mistakes in the auto attack timing?"
"Go back to table format and add a column for cumulative damage done"
"Do it again but add a column for Damage per second so far"
"Can you show me a graph of dps over time for that table?"
"Can you let me download it instead of putting it on imgur?"

Do I have to nested the original or can I flatten it out somehow?"
"how do I iterate over every entry in a pandas series"
"Going back to the with query, I want to do something like this:\n\nwith profiles as (\n    select department, profile_view\n    from \n        (select id, name, department, age from demo_table limit 10000)\n        , \n        table(whylogs_object({ 'id': id, 'name':name, 'department': department, 'age': age} ) over (partition by department))\n)\n\nselect * from table(whylabs_upload(profiles.profile_view) over (partition by profiles.department))\n;"
