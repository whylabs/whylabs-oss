Why did you restore this comment again? I'm not allowed to remove current comments f.E. warnings and so on, but I'm allowed to remove this bot comment on my talk page because this makes no sense, you see.  

Do not think that I don't know the Wikipedia rules. I'm allowed to remove old comments on my talk page.  

OK, I agree but when the time has come, I'll remove this old comment. Just tell me how long shall I keep this comments saved?  

OK, you got it.  

Oh and how can I post images on my userpage?  

Thank you about that.  

 Why did you revert all 11/27 edits to scouting in oregon? 

Who died an made you the the lord?

All edits were based on information provided by authorative sources.  Your revert was based on your understanding of your opinion and therefore makes Wikipedia a useless effort.

Links to the authorative websites for the councils is appropriate. See Crater Lake link is allowed but Oregon Pacific, Cascade Pacific, Blue Mountain, etc are not?  Oregon Council links are not allowed but California is?

Information by district corrections were removed? . . the correct information was updated from the authorive websites of the Councils.  Do you not check the information before you delete or correct?

Again, the worth of a wiki is it's accuracy. . . by external validated resources. Each link was provided for your review.  Take some time, get off the Code REd and, spend sometime reviewing the information.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

 Thank you! 

I just wanted to say thank you for catching the vandalism in the Langston Hughes article. Yes, I know you were just doing regular vandal patrol. Still, I am so very thankful for your diligence.  The vandalism can be so discoraging to me.  Again, thank you so very, very much.

I don't condone insulting america, even if what htey say is true, just for our benefit.

I don't try to bash my city or say it's a bad place, and contrary to how i feel, the city actually HAS been getting better in recent years (2003-now), despite crime rates increasing somewhat. Homelessness is down slightly, violent crime was down right up until our first-ever cop killing... our main problems are unemployment and petty theft/small crimes like robbery. our rape level is low, as is our murder rape. Windsor's main issues for crime are assaults, threats, and burglary/ Break-And-Enter (B&E;).

Now, one might get confused when they say """"but coonfox, you just said it has the highest crime rate!"""" True, we do per capita. We have more Break-And-Enters and convenience store robberies than any other city in canada when adjusted to population. Overall, though, Toronto, Ontario and Metro Detroit still beat us, since they have around 4 million people each (20x our population).

 Question 

Would you be happy if nobody else contributed to the Spore aticle?  (talk|Contribs) 
No. Other people have contributed. This isn't about contribution.   
I know, but a lot of your posts on the talk page go something like this:
Editor #1: I think the article should say this.
You: No.
Editor #2: I think the article should say that.
You: NO NO NO! [refer to something that supports your view on what the article should say] Period. End of discussion.
Editor #2: But...
You: I don't want to hear it. You're WRONG.
Now granted, not all of your posts are like that, but there are so many that have that kind of tone that I think it's likely to scare away a lot of would-be contributors.  (talk|Contribs) 
It may seem that way now.   
It has seemed like that for a while. You disagree with a majority of people, and it's getting a bit disruptive in my view. Don't claim ownership on the article JAF, others are free to edit it. Your opinion doesn't control it.   
Why don't you check the other articles I created - I don't interfere that much. Spore is just an article that people want to add wrong information to. And it isn't my opinion. I've already backed up what I've said with tons and tons of facts and citations. Things will change when the game comes out, because a lot of the article will disappear (ie. the phases will be clearer instead of what was just based on what was told to us.)

Do you know if it actually is going to be on PC? All I've seen is 360 and PS3 so far.  T/C 
I believe it states so on the official site. Looks like there's no announced Windows version.   
Which would suck, because I'm a PC-only gamer. However, the picture of the case on IGN certainly looks like a PC-style case, and somebody else was saying EA forgot to announce a PC version of a game before. So I'll hold out hope, because it looks to be a good game.  T/C

Section on Turkey
Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue. 

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections. 

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

""""Turkey
On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]""""""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6   

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide.  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime).  

Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. 

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information. 

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section.

The new piece on notable uchi-deshi needs to be fleshed out.  

Biography
I would like to see the biography expanded a bit while avoiding style or author specific references.  It's a bit redundant when the points are made elsewhere - about 20% of Ueshiba's Biography was talking about Saito and Ueshiba's son each which have their own entries.  The links are adequet for finding the information.  

I expanded the biography being careful not to exclude information already there. 

 Would someone adress why in the section on Deguchi there is very little information on his encounter
 with the chinese army, I mention this because I believe the """"dodging balls of white light"""" story 
should be first in the section of """"awakenings """" 
that led to the roots of aikido. This story is very prevalent in aikdo literature 
and I wonder why it is not included.128.192.36.80  

 Soke Morihei Ueshiba 

I noticed that the """"Soke"""" is the name for """"founder of a style"""", (martial arts). Should Ueshibas article include this title?—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Absolutely not.  Soke is a title used by some Japanese martial arts to refer to the founder or head but I have never heard the term used in Aikido.  In Japan Ueshiba M. is sometimes referred to as Kaiso which means founder and in fact this term is far more commonly used than O sensei which seems to be a Western affection.  I have actually run into Aikidoists mortally offended by another art using the term O sensei as if it somehow slights Ueshiba M..  Both Kaiso and O sensei tend to be used primarily within the Aikikai and its newer derivatives.  In the older styles it is much more common to just hear Ueshiba sensei but then again they do not have the confusion of familial succession.  Personally I would like to see O sensei removed from the articles orther than a mention that some Aikidoists refer to him as such but I think that would raise a few hackels. 

Hackles be dammed I reduced the number of O sensei's in the text and clarified its usage a tad. I have never heard one Japanese Shihan use the term O sensei while in Japan.  Not saying they don't just that its not common. 

Well it's fine by me. I only asked because I noticed Gozo Shioda is referred to as """"Soke Gozo Shioda"""" on the official Yoshinkan website. When I first saw it I figured that if Shioda had a """"Soke""""-title then Ueshiba should too. Oh, by the way, my own aikido club (Ki-aikido) usually just say """"Ueshiba sensei"""" or """"Ueshiba"""". I cant actually remember anyone using the phrase O-sensei other than in a few introductionary speeches.
 

Interesting point about Yoshinkan I am more familiar with them using the term Kancho but it is their choice. Perhaps they didn't use Kaiso as not to confuse Shioda with Ueshiba.  Soke would not be a wrong usage for either man just in the case of Ueshiba it was not the term used.  I am going to ask a Yoshinkan Honbu Instructor his opinion on this.  At Shodokan Honbu (Tomiki's dojo) it is always Ueshiba sensei and interestingly Tomiki is always refered to as either Shihan or sensei - no other titles.  In Ki society how is Tohei sensei refered to?  

Tohei? Well I suppose it's mostly just """"Tohei-sensei"""" and/or """"Tohei"""" for mentionings in day to day training. (to say Tohei without the """"-sensei"""" might sound disrespectful in Japan but it is not in Sweden )) As for the official, formal titles of both Koichi Tohei and Kenjiro Yoshigasaki I have no idea.

 The lies in how he built the clock 

I was reading the following section and I see lots of issues of truth in it:

""""His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said that on Monday morning, September 14, 2015, he drove his son to school and encouraged him to display his technological ability.[4]

In an interview on Al Jazeera's Ali Velshi on Target, Mohamed said the clock was """"built from scrap around the house"""" and that """"some of the boards were already manufactured.""""[5] He told Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show that it took him """"10 or 20 minutes"""" to put it together and that he has built more complicated items, but that the clock was simple, using some parts that were scrapped off so that it was easier.[6] According to the initial report in The Dallas Morning News, he had done this """"before bed on Sunday. [September 13, 2015]""""[7]""""

Nowhere is there a paragraph underneath that should write """"While Ahmed claims he built the clock from """"scrap"""", it is well known among tech enthusiasts that it is simply the components of a digital clock with no cover. So what I'm asking, is it alright to add sources that show he was lying?

 Maps and Cathedrals. 

Please stop adding maps to those already lengthy cathedral boxes.  They are superfluous.  Every cathedral is in a city. Every city has a map.  Putting maps for the cathedrals themselves is overkill. 

It's like this:  if a significant person is mentioned within the context of an article, then we link that person's biography.  We don't give the dates of the person's life, unless they are absolutely relevant to the text of the article e.g. """"the architect John Bloggs died in 1455, leaving the spire incomplete.""""  If john Bloggs has his own article then we don't write """"John Bloggs (1402-1455) built the spire"""".   

Similarly, if a person wants to know where Chichester Cathedral is, within Sussex,  they will look at Chichester. 

The problem is that maps and lists in the right hand box take up space that is much better utilised by pictures.  Cathedrals are visually among the most important works of art that have been created.  Great long lists of cleargy and specifications don't need to be in the right hand box, any more than the map does.  The lists can go anywhere else in the article.  But the right hand side, particularly within the first paragraphs of the main body of text, is the prime space for illustrating the building, its history, its style and so on.  Cathedral websites,  (well-done cathedral websites) never give lengthy lists of people on the home page.  They give a link to where you can find that stuff if you want it.  They also give a link to """"how to find us"""".  They don't attempt to put a map on the home page. 

Jamming a map in, to take up space where there could be a plan of the building or a photo of the interior, is not useful.

cee3e5625016d8d7,"A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  

In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. 

Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. 

This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] 

The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change.

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

 The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is """"British & Irish Isles"""". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.

Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? 
 
Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople. 
 
A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now """"Greek islands"""" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated """"Greek"""" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.
 
Thus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

I certainly do not have a problem with this user CORRECTING birth date years to reflect the truth, provided some kind of proof is given in the form of a link to an authoritative web site or other source.  The evidence indicates however that the changes made by this user were in fact arbitrary additions or subtractions of a year or two or ten.  It may be that the user inadvertently hit on a """"correct"""" year purely by accidental coincidence, particularly if there are """"source information"""" sites that have alternate years of birth posted as well.  But there are other cases in the contributions list where the user made a change to a false year, and then changed it back to the correct year, either to confuse the anti-vandalism patrollers, or to make the latest edit look like a true and legitimate one.

A user, who I've engaged in conversation on their talk page, removed Peyton Manning from the """"Retired numbers"""" section of the article, on the grounds that it's """"assumed"""" though not """"official.""""  My reasoning as posted on said talk page, was that Jim Irsay, the CEO of the Colts, stated pretty firmly that no player will ever wear the number 18 again (http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/3/7/2853459/peyton-manning-press-conference-transcript-2012-free-agency-nfl).

After edit conflict  including with myself. (D'oh.)
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder...  but never mind, this could end up as an infinite regression.  Shall we just say, the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent, or as their actual implication, so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic.  (You also don't address my question about notification at all.)
My statement was about a) JS's actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism, rather than chess (and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality); and b) the motivation of that editor (indeed, every editor, at least to that point) to be writing about him at all.  That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a """"pretext to promote a creationist agenda"""" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.  (What I had in mind was more, increasing similarity to dust-jacket prose, and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities.)
Your """"false comparison"""" is likewise, nothing like any I was making.  JS is very notable as a Creationist, being a bucketload-selling author on such topics, as well as an internet celeb, which certainly merits an article, which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player.  He's not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such, and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player, out of proportion to actual notability.
At any rate, if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is, I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment.  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess, personally, going as it largely does to """"does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns"""", about which I have opinions, but little direct involvement.

 The precise definition of race is under dispute.. 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

Don't worrythere isn't some coordinated campaign going on.  A Toronto on-line paper copied the Wikipedia entry pretty much word for word in a promo for Thursday's concert, which has led to some discussion on the fan boards.  Some attempted deletes are inevitable.  It'll pass.  I think it would help if you didn't think of these folks as """"the enemy""""just folks who don't agree with the paragraph being there, and aren't familiar with how Wikipedia works.  And why am I not here reverting?  Because I'm over there trying to explain how Wikipedia works, so maybe there'll be fewer problems over here. -

 Nothing personal 

Greetings Elitra, I just wanted to let you know my comments are nothing personal towards you or the other WMF folks but the release of VE with so many problems is premature and folks have a valid point that proper notification wasn't given. Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone

Let me just say that my friend is a very dedicated fan, which the news clip even attests to, and although his comments might seem a bit unusual, I think they're interesting in that they speak unique ways a fan could view a movie.

As far as copyright infringement or irrelevance, I've already addressed how the clip is relevant, so I'll say what I have to on IP. Having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years, and now as a student in law school, I am convinced from what I know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film, and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the ABC news team for the release of their story. So, please, can we try to negotiate or come to some sort of agreement that it will be okay to leave this clip up?

f0b3496b164a5c17,"""Here is the summary:

 I agree that wikipedia articles may have pictures and it is preferable to show them for the convenience of the reader. The pictures of Jesus, Mary etc. are very commonly depicted in the churches and other places, so whenever there is article to explain about Jesus and christianity then it is much preferable to give the abstract idea to the user about how 'Christianity looks like and what is associated with it (including the pictures of Jesus and Mary)'. Now agreeing to the this, the problem is that there are no images associated to Muhammad or other Prophets in Muslims as well as Mosques and any other places. So, when a reader will come to know about Isamic articles then he will be given the idea of 'how Islam looks like and what is associated to Isalm and Muhammad (including Islamic calligraphy)'. Now if there does not exist and prominent association about Muhammad's picture then it is NOT necessary to somehow bring 'Any insignificant' picture no matter it is drawn by some 12 year old kid or some very unpopular artist who is not only unknown in the nonIslamic world but Muslims too.
 So, when a Muslim comes to the article about Muhammad, he will just feel strange on the rediculous depiction and might even laugh that """"I did'nt know there is such picture used about Islam"""". 
 Imagine the misery of a wikipedia article in where the follower of the religion himself has to laugh at what is being shown as a fact about his religion.  
 I hope my comments look valid at the same time when I agree about the value of an image where it is actually represending the article and not contradicting it.

I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other. I shall see what I can do to clear this up (using reliable sources, of course).—  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

This article seems to have improved from its first review significantly. Most problems are resolved, such as the sub-par prose, which is now very well readable. Some comments on the issues raised in the first review:
 the period dealt with spans approximately mid-2013 to September 2014. This is an indication it may not meet criterion 3a. - As far as I can see, there is not a lot more to say about this young lady so far. While taking in interest in people who are famous because of their parents and because of who they date eludes me, it is no reason to fail criterion 3a.
 Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!

However, these things should be adressed:
 Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.
 The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.
 However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.
 You might wanna find a better source for the Elvis and Nixon film. Maybe this one even though it is certainly not perfect as well.

It certainly can be amusing to try to construct alternative theories to explain this evidence. And amusing to try to come up with more evidence. It is all good mental exercise I would commend to anyone. How many scientific facts/observations/pieces of evidence can one come up with to """"prove"""" the earth is round ? (I use prove loosely here, since there is no proof in science only in mathematics and logic). 

One caution I have, is that some of these explanations are clever. Some are just silly, like saying the earth is not warmer now than it was 100 years ago. However, the measurements are the measurements. And even when all kinds of corrections are taken acount of, the temperatures now are warmer than they were 100 years ago. Done using thousands of instruments of different types in different locations by different people who got consistent results. Incorrect theories are bad enough, but bad data is fatal. 

As to your other questions, it is easy to measure the earth's free oscillations with a weight on a spring. It is done all the time and has been done for decades. And they have very characteristic temporal and spatial frequencies corresponding to oscillations of a rotating sphere. A bit hard to wave your hands to make those observations go away. You might be able to do it if you were really an excellent applied mathematician and willing to spend a few months in crazy speculative inverse theory computations. Currents of course are possible, but these are very special kinds of currents that have special kinds of characteristics that match what one would expect from a fluid on a rotating spherical earth. I have personally seen the curve of the earth when standing on a very high point. Now of course it could be an optical illusion, but it is a very compelling one if it is. However you can put it down to refraction or some other optical effect. In fact, you could even put photographs of the earth from space down to those. As I said above (and you nicely demonstrated my point), you can explain almost ANYTHING away and maintain some pre-conceived notion if you are willing to throw away parsimony and the demands of prediction, etc. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

So please. Tell me what the Spaghetti Monster has done that Penelopism hasn't. What can we do so that Penelopism can be on wikipedia? Because I am having trouble understanding.

9229110ba023d006,"I agree this article is not based on Sarah Palin. That is why I want the revert. Since those comments many edits have been made to the article, and it would be foolish to assume those edits were made solely with intent to improve the article. I think this talk page alone is enough evidence of that. Prior to comments made, the article hadn't been edited in weeks and most of the edits prior to that were minor edits, mostly a bunch of grammar and some reworking of sentences and sentence structure. I think the lack of editing of the article and the nature of previous edits shows that for such a longstanding article, there was a silent consensus that the article was good and needing very little. 

Now look at it. The section on the ride alone dominates the article, much of it relates to whether or not Revere was warning who or what when prior to June 5th such sections and commentary were neither present nor viewed as necessary to article. Ask yourself, and the guidelines, this: which version of the article, now or prior to the extreme amount of editing that took place, was most closely meeting the criteria for a good article?",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

Parkwells, yes, I went to the source you referred/linked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say: These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jefferson’s Farm Book(7) as being visitors to Monticello (The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors, but lists an accounting of his plantations, e.g. livestock, land, crops, costs, and slaves.) 'Not a logbook of visitors.' Hardly compelling.Schulz, your notion that Hyland's book has 'been ignored by scholars' simply because it is not mentioned at the cite you linked to is ridiculous, esp since it has indeed been endorsed by many scholars, including former members of the TJF. Hyland is Adjunct Professor at Stetson University, College of Law, at Tampa Bay, Florida. If you think that Hyland is dead, why don't you send him an email / WHYLAND@travelers.com and see how he feels about that. You have the wrong Hyland. Hyland's book came out in 2009, the Hyland you're referring to died in 2008. Please do you homework. And if you are ready to dismiss a source because of two spelling errors it is clear that your mind is quite closed and simply can't come to terms with the idea that there are a whole body of historians, professors, who exist outside of the box you seem to have enclosed yourself in.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.

As I mentioned above, I rarely visit the arbcom IRC channel (which itself is not heavily used even by members of the ArbCom); swearing it off is largely a meaningless act.  I could readily stop participating in the mailing list, because I would essentially get the same information via other channels.  You seem to think that this is the only backchannel that exists or that I participate in.  It's not.  It's not even the most important one.  For me to accede to the spirit of your demand would require that, inter alia, I cut myself off from personal communication with people like James and Kat  people I count as friends  because they would likely continue to discuss the same issues with me that we currently discuss from time to time on the arbcom list; my opinions would still enter the discussion, just not as directly.  Furthermore, one of the major resources I use for collaboration with the Foundation, and specifically with Danny and Brad  which, by necessity is a wholly private resource  includes James and Kat as regular participants.  Withdrawing from that particular resource would hamper my ability to provide assistance to Brad and Danny, which represents probably the bulk of what I do on the English Wikipedia these days, and the part that I find most fulfilling.  I also frequently participate in """"backchannel"""" conversation with Kat, James, Dmcdevit (another arbitrator), and occasionally smoddy on the restricted IRC admins channel.  Should I also withdraw from that channel?  It seems that the you and Geogre, through your joint demand, are seeking to require that I isolate myself totally from the entire ArbCom (Geogre's proposal even requires that I even refrain from public communication with members of the ArbCom; I don't recall if yours does, although I believe it does not).  Those people, some of them, at least, are my friends.  For you to ask such a thing is really quite heartless.  It would be akin to my demanding that you have no nonpublic contact with the myriad of friends you have no doubt made on Wikipedia.  

So, you must forgive me: I would rather resign my privileges with honor than accept either of the alternatives left to me:  giving you a hollow victory gained through my unethical manipulation of your own ignorance, or the personal harm of agreeing to cut myself off from those I count as friends.

I'm just telling facts... One who doesn't take to Krishna consciousness - is most condemned and cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas (kalpa = 1000*10*432000 years):
""""Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Antya 3.255

e-vanyāya ye nā bhāse, sei jīva chāra
koṭi-kalpe kabhu tāra nāhika nistāra
SYNONYMS

e-vanyāya — in this inundation; ye — anyone who; nā bhāse — does not float; sei — that; jīva — living entity; chāra — most condemned; koṭi-kalpe — in millions of kalpas; kabhu — at any time; tāra — his; nāhika — there is not; nistāra — deliverance.
TRANSLATION

""""Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.
PURPORT

The kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""

Hi again, and well done for registering. 

Regarding the link that you were/are wanting to add to the Correlation and dependence article, I suggest the following... (i) you could best make your points for inclusion on the article's talk/discussion page, so that others can comment ... the edit summary and user's talk pages are not good for this; (ii) you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this link's content (that is, an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under """"External links""""), so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding """"interpretation""""; (iii) if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say, or a good way of looking at things, then you could try to summarise/ re-state these points within the article itself  ...again you could ask for opinions/help on the article's talk page, but there is really no reason why you shouldn't go ahead and add something. My own opinion is that adding plain """"external links"""" should be avoided once an article has substantial content. A previous editor mentioned """"linkspam"""" and, while this link might not quite fit within that term, the website itself didn't seem to have a lot of other content (but I could be wrong) and the """"substantiality"""" of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate.

If you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see Wikipedia:WikiProject Statistics. There is certainly need for help in improving the """"understandability"""" of all of the statistics articles, so don't be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities.

Might we want either a temporary hatnote or a """"see also"""" for the present humanitarian crisis? I came here expecting to find a link to that article, wherever it may be, and couldn't find any. -  | Talk 

.  (moult with my mallards) 

A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.  

 Name 

in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.

I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?    

Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

371b6d2e20d78fd7,"""::: Yes, that was an RPJ rant. But criticism articles really are required sometimes (here's a great example) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place. The general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle, so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article (this does not have to be exhaustive), and vice versa, which probably we should be careful to do in the main JFK assassination article. And so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles, which I hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter WC view in the JFK assassination theories article, and mentioning that other views than the WC's exist, in the main article.In line with Wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith, the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article. There is no consensus whether a """"Criticism of .... """" article is always a POV fork. At least the """"Criticism of ... """" article should contain rebuttals if available. And the original article should contain a summary of the """"Criticism of ... """" article. I know I'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the WC view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public. Unfortunately, the general public's view is not informed, and is warped by the slick Oliver Stone JFK, which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them; plus the HSCA shocker with the dictabelt, which got way more airtime than ITS rebuttal, later. All of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives WP:V toward untruthfullness, which is that TRUTH is quite often dull and not very entertaining, and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it. Jimbo Wales thinks that if something is true it should have plenty of citable supporters, but sometimes that's just not the case.

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Biochemistry Vandalism
PLEASE if you are not sure about something please discuss it here. Steroids include phytosterols. Phytosterols are not derived from cholesterol otherwise all vegan people would be in deep trouble ). In general there is a tendency to write comments from a human perspective. Please remember that compounds are found throughout nature and span many living organisms. That said I removed the anonymous person's comments that all steroids come from cholesterol, who he removed my previous comments on the HMG-CoA pathway. I added lanosterol and squalene instead.  Thanks.  

 corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid 

Canof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as """"steroids"""" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. 

removed section and reasons

TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.
TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WP:SELF. More specifically: your mistaken definition of """"reference"""". WP:SELF seeks to avoid encyclopediac references. This means that all the facts of all articles come from the source and never from another article. The reason for this is clear.
You, however, choose to define """"reference"""" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly. 
Somehow you've come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant, despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary. McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia.

I can't believe it!
This story of how they got their doctor degree has been discussed before, and agreed upon, a long time ago. That was before EE guy time but anyway, the same on different forums, and not earlier than this august month. And to clear out all doubts, thought it is a far out dream, and as Igor has already pointd it out a few articles above, which mean only a few hours before you came with your extract, mention honorable is a very honorable mention who is seldom given to a thesis and mean that the work is considered as being very good.
Do you get it now?
Or shall we absolutely repeat this, let say, 1000 times before it get in to the correct part of your brain system?
This being already a repetition. But if you were less eager to get all your informations on that matter at the same source:YBM own edits and promotion web side, it will help a lot.
I have already in august presented the prooves that the article you use above as a proof is nothing but a homemade text created by ybm who has absolutely no knowledge of the doctorat point system or who did it on purpose. Both well cooresponding to ybms' untrustworthy selvmade image.
Yourself could get some indormations about this fact, instead of echooing what you read like """"I knew it too and agreed"""" when in fact all of those data are rants without contact to reality.
Shall I sign zorro or shall I put your own name? afterall what the hell shall I have my own signature when anyway it is freely accused for being another one at anytime and for anything?

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III.

 Sigüenza y Góngora 

Hi Rockero, thanks for all the work on the Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora article. Interesting material, and I'd never seen it before.

I have one minor question. Was his father really born in America? I knew Carlos was, but I had assumed his father was from Spain, because of the royal tutoring.

 
The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste. My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace, but a Continental birth is much more likely, given the timeframe and his position. I changed it to peninsular, only to discover the deficiencies in that article.
I presume you are referring to S y G's theories about the origin of the Olmecs and the evangelization of Thomas when you say you found the new material interesting? Such theories were actually quite common, and it appears that SyG was one of the first to come up with them, or maybe just the first to popularize them. The Mormons were way behind. 8)
One final note: I'm guessing that """"book examiner"""" is your translation of """"corregidor general"""". Is this correct? My English-language sources make use of the term """"censor"""", which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general. I have added Censor (Catholic Church) to the censor dab page, in hopes of composing an article on the post, but refrained from linking it from the SyG article. If I am in error, please correct me. Thanks for your comments, and the pic looks great,  
Yes, if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general, but I'm away from my encylopedias now and can't definitely verify that. I'm sure I can find a copy of Enciclopedia de México in a library here (I'm in Los Angeles now), but it may be a little while before I get to that. """"Book examiner"""" wasn't really my translation. I had no idea what the original term meant, but I found him referred to as """"book examiner"""" on a web page, and I identified the two. I think it's safe to assume all three terms refer to the same office.

Copra was a main crop in Samoa before German trade, it's stated so in your own version. Yet then later saying that it was monopolized by Germans. There weren't enough Germans to work a plantation, at most were soldiers. Samoa trade was involved, yet your version paints a white on brown invasion of interests.

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!""""

 Preferred use of Virginia-geo-stub? 

Grutness, please help a clueless newbie...  I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).

I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).  

However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?

I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.

Thanks in advance for filling me in.

 

Thanks for the help, Grutness (at User_talk:JohnPomeranz)

 

 Politician-stubs monitoring 

Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.  (talk) 

Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations. My main motivation is to see a consistent system for both the geo-stubs, the politician-stubs, and any other type of stub. So if the ge",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """".

This source again? Everything there is based from one man's opinion. Lets see what else Jay Windley says now show we? in a desperate attempt to explain why there should be no molten dust under the LM, Windley claims: """"We collected some desert rocks and dust and heated them with an oxy-acetylene torch (5,700 F) for five minutes. They did not melt, and they were only slightly discolored."""" (http://www.clavius.org/techcrater.html) Really? I would love to hear from geogolists about this. Someone who makes a statement like that should never ever being used as a reliable source.

Jarrah White also contacted Rocketdyne (which is included in one of my censored posts, but what else would you expect?). And unlike Jay Windley, Jarrah actually shows us their answer:

""""Thank you for your interest in Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. In answer to your question, I can only offer a generic answer to how a Service Engineer was defined during the time period in question. A Service Engineer would have provided technical support for actions like equipment processing, transportation, installation, check-out, and for the launch itself. This would have been either when the product was in the field ready for use or during analysis prior to delivery to the customer."""" - Bryan Kidder; Rocketdyne, Communications Director.""""

So much for """"Kaysing was not technically qualified"""" which the article wrongly claims.

The fact that i need to repeat all of these already posted censored facts is laughable, but thats what wikipedia has become. So at the end of the day, who should we trust? a self proven, caught liar? or Rocketdyne themselfs?

What they (first two comments) are telling is that """"the research method"""" and """"the theory"""" should be split into two articles. """"The research method"""" is called """"Social network analysis"""", and the theory is called """"Social network theory"""".

Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello, Wikid77 here. Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:
 """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.
 """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.
 """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.
 """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.
 """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.
I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative
