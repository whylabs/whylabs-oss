 Personally, I feel there is a big difference between CLAIM and INTEND.

Summarized: EMDR is INTENDED to....

Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development.

Summary: Intention
 
Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy seeks to identify and change """"distorted"""" or """"unrealistic"""" ways of thinking, and therefore to influence emotion and behaviour.
Summary: intention

Interpersonal Therapy Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a form of psychotherapy used to treat a variety of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bulimia nervosa, and communication disorders.

Summary: is used to treat (effectiveness implied?))

psychotherapy Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, relational intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid clients in problems of living.
I like the INTERVENTION, I dont like used to aid, as this implies 100% effectiveness??

Chiropractic Chiropractic (from Greek chiros and praktikos meaning """"done by hand"""") is a health care profession whose purpose is to diagnose and treat mechanical disorders of the spine and musculoskeletal system with the intention of affecting the nervous system and improving health.[1] It

Summary: (purpose = ) Intend.

Faith Healing Faith healing, also called divine healing or spiritual healing, is the use of spiritual means in treating disease, It is purportedly a supernatural manifestation that brings healing and deliverance from all kinds of diseases whether organic, functional, or psychological.

Purport Strongly POV. The condemnation can be felt.

 
Interventions are INTENDED, practitioners (all sorts) CLAIM. The effectiveness and criticism should, in my POV, be in a seperate section.

The Harpers magazine article you list and also called well written contains the phrase """"Post American"""" in the sub-title and article content, an obvious bias. Time is no exception to bias. Every city demolishes structures, so its not notable. One of the authors you list, for example, has controversies cited on Wikipedia for 'misreporting', hardly a good source.  The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias. They amount to WP:Fancruft and WP:Coatrack.  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias. Detroit takes in plenty, its $1.1 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like 'decline' and others inserted are inappropriate. An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts - it shows responsible action by the governor. The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit's home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.
And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.
And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". 
This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")
The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.

So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.

As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. 
I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.
Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.

However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. 

But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

So what's the next article you want to work up to GA status? I actually LIKE writing footnotes, and finding sources for stuff. I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night. Might as well add my services to whatever you're working on next...  | Talk 

Well, given your area of interest, why not American Quarter Horse?  Dlh-Stablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also, and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good, the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing, though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally.  That might be another possibility.  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work.  Have you looked over the criteria yet?   

 Briefly, I looked them over. I recall that they need lots of citations, in depth and with enough pictures/diagrams to make things easy to understand for the non-initiate. I'm sure there is a lot more. I've got books on the vet or training side of things, but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history. You've obviously been working hard on things with the horses, and I figured I'd rather work with you, than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles. Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker, I would think. Of course, I'm still new at this, but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it. Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much, honestly. I'd have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed... and the history of the controversies behind the registry, and .. well you get the idea. Oddly enough, given my Quarter horse interests, I own Arabians (grins) so I'd love to see the Arabian article make Featured.... but I'm scared to ask how much work that would take! Anyway, now that I've babbled, I'm more than happy to watch you work and help however I can. Certainly don't want to work at cross-purposes.  | Talk 

The internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff, most """"generic"""" horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies.  The breed registry web sites are often much better (though they aren't above POV, at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus, which is a wholly unverifiable claim! .  You want an easy job, go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article.  Most in there are stubs, and need expansion, some are red links that aren't even real breeds (For example, you don't want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the """"Egyptian Arabian"""" is a different breed, BTW(grin)) so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief.  (Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse, don't ask me how.)  I got [{Arabian horse]] pretty much to GA status singlehandedly, but it took awhile, editing it from a disaster of anti-Arabian POV to GA status over a period of several months, learning all the way.  My panic about putting it up for FA (I actually think it's almost there) is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with (for example, the controversies section, almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion.  It's needed.).  I'm not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesn't totally screw it up or, worse yet, restart battles that were settled a long time ago.  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch, and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning (which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished), I basically had it ready for GA in about a week, with a few contributions from some other editors like

Ten Point Plan (AKA the Pee-wee Manifesto)NOTE: THIS IS NOT VANDALISM

I demand that the following conditions be met and complied with or else face the wrath of my never ending and growing database of vandal attacks. if you wish for my vandalism to cease, simply, you must comply with my standards in the following Ten Point Plan:

1. user:Gscshoyru and User:Dreadstar must both cease ALL wikipedia activity and disband their accounts, or at the very least negotiable, cease your administrator status. this condition MUST be met to stop the vandalism. if this conditon is not met, the vandalism will not cease (users, if you really cared for wikipedia as you both claim, surely it would be in wikipedia's interest to stop me from vandalising, so in order to stop me, you must stop your wikipedia activity and/or drop your admin status) any time in the perceivable future.

2. That in the article """"Ronald Mcdonald"""", Ronald is listed as a """"happy"""" clown

3. That any defaming or negative remarks regarding Pee Wee Herman or Paul Reubens are removed

4. That any new edits to either Ronald Mcdonald or Paul Reubens are approached with respect (i.e, no bad/negative comments, no defamation, nothing that can be perceived as hurting the reputation of Ronald Mcdonald or Pee Wee Herman

5. That ALL articles regarding Mcdonalds, fast-food, hamburgers, french fries, and good corporate practice carry the """"Mcdonald's arch""""

6. that further more, the """"Paul Reubens"""", """"Pee-Wee Herman"""", """"Tony Curtis"""", """"Maury Povich"""", and """"Construction"""" articles are protected and NEVER updated ever again

7. that the """"controversy"""" section from the article on Mcdonald's is removed

 Collapse by consciousness? Face the consequences! 

If we take the """"collapse by consciousness"""" viewpoint then:

 Consequence 1.

In famous experiments with entanglement (Aspect's, and
other), thousands of entangled pairs are created and measured, each
pair during a microscopically short time; no human observes individual
results in real time (and usually, never at all); rather, a computer
registers them, calculates frequencies (statistical averages) and
displays these to a human observer.

Does it mean, thousand of collapses? No; rather, a single collapse
after the whole experiment. No definite values for individual spin
projections; only a definite value for the average.

 Consequence 2.

Do you believe that human consciousness acts on the microsecond scale?
Probably not. Probably, on the scale of seconds. Then, a collapse
takes about seconds. Then, entanglements could be relevant to
faster-than-light communication only on distances of million
kilometers (or so). Definitely irrelevant in all experiments performed
for now (on the Earth) or planned in the near future.

Mel Bay may cite Marlow as """"something of an authority on the ten-string guitar"""", but also as something of an authority on the ten-string guitar I have reviewed her approach guide and found it misinformative in the following respects:
 
1. In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that """"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar"""". In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: """"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale."""" That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.

2. Marlow does not define the term """"resonance"""", which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on """"Controlling Resonance"""" in which controlling """"resonance"""" is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). 

3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author's """"own"""" method of tuning """"satisfies the needed sustain"""" (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author's tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C's. 

4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that """"In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning"""" that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not """"over twenty five years"""". Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow's """"own process"""". 

5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists """"the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer"""" as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.)

What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

 Accusations you made against Harvey Bialy 

 I see no external (not wiki) source for you grave accusation against Harvey Bialy. Please provide us with that external source. You MUST do it. Thank you.

One can find any number of uncouth Bialy quotes here, including the one which I mentioned. However, my source was the dissident AIDSWiki, which proudly publicized Bialy's comments here. By the way, it was not so much a """"grave accusation"""" as a direct quote from Bialy which he himself has gone out of his way to publicize. An accusation is unnecessary; his words speak for themselves.  

The accusation was to say that Bialy said that, but seems that he said it. We do not know what was said in the previous dialogue with the other guy, though. 

Wikipedia is a tertiary source, and anyone can write anything. That´s the reason I asked you for an external source. Anyway, thank you for the references. 

No problem; you were right to demand a source. I didn't mean to give you a hard time about that.

Blueboar, you cannot be that naive.  I suspect that you have realised that you have stepped over the mark.

By even suggesting, in a widely read public forum such as this, that the GLdF is an irregular Grand Lodge is the vilest and most vicious attack that any Mason can make upon the Grand Master, officers and members of any other Masonic jurisdiction, and it is unforgiveable.

Your Grand Lodge does NOT state anywhere in the public domain, that the GLdF is an IRREGULAR Grand Lodge and I challenge you to demonstrate to us where yu say it does.  Not your word for it, a reliable source i.e. The Grand Lodge of New York itself.  Prove me wrong, I won't mind.

What is clear is that The Grand Lodge of New York is bound by the policies of The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America which has specifically removed any claim to be the arbiters of Masonic regularity, quite rightly, and good on them.

Take a look at their 2007 and 2008 reports.  They are on their website and in print in black and white.  Incontrovertable historical evidence.

And then you come along.  And you arbritrarily vilify The Grand Lodge of France and The Grand Lodge of All England.  Bear in mind that I have been, and we are, in contact with the Conference and its Commission on Information over these very issues.  They have graciously received our submissions and their statements have been carefully worded accordingly, to include ALL Grand Lodges throughout the world.

This is their and your current OFFICIAL policy:

2007: """"It must again be stated that the Commission does not determine the regularity of a Grand Lodge; it only evaluates the facts available to determine if the entity meets the standards for recognition, as adopted by the Conference of Grand Masters of North America, and reports those findings to the member Grand Lodges of this Conference for their use.""""

2008: """"We must state again that even though a Grand Lodge may practice regular Masonry, we only determine whether the Grand Lodge meets all the standards for recognition, as established by this Conference.""""

Not our words, or the Grand Lodge of France's words, their words.  The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of The Grand Lodge of New York) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY.

This is an encyclopedia.  There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan Grand Lodge, yours or ours.  History rises above that sort of thing.  If you want to express political opinions then write a book and publish it under you own name, but don't call it history.  History is neutral.

We can cooperate on the history of Freemasonry on Wikipedia, but we must first agree to eliminate partisan politics or it is a complete waste of time.

By the way, the """"Antients"""" Grand Lodge, properly named The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons According to the Old Institution is the UGLE.  Please read The Charter of Compact 1813; it is quite specific on this matter.  Enough said.

And in your version of French Masonic history you have completely ommitted to mention our Lodge which was instituted and based in Paris c.1718 but certainly no later than 1720.  You probably don't know about it, but it is this sort of ommission which may be rectified if you calm your passions and your prejudices and get down to the serious business of reporting Masonic history.  It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness.  The UGLE is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of Freemasonry in France.

And finally, I can assure you that the Grand Lodge of France couldn't give a fig for the opinions of the UGLE.  Do you consider, even for one second, that if they were the least bit concerned about what the UGLE thought of them that they would have entered into a formal Treaty of Amity with the Grand Lodge of All England?  You must think about what you are saying before you blindly leap into expressions of baseless opinion.

This is the same bio that is used by the university at which I am a professor.  In fact, I think thats how the edit may have gotten tagged as a copyright violation.  Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:

Andy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.  In 2003 Brick set a historic milestone conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in the world’s first symphonic game music concert at the Gewandaus, Leipzig Germany to a sold out audience of 2200.

This concert series featured new symphonic music written by Andy and performed by the Neue Elbland Philharmonie.  Brick also served as music director for the first Chamber Music Concert of the Kammerphilharmonie.  Brick has conducted over 70 game titles including Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Halo, and World of Warcraft with orchestras throughout the world including The Prague Symphony, The Czech National Symphony, The North Carolina Symphony, The Bratislava Symphony, The Moravian Philharmonic, The Filmharmonic of Prague and members of the New York Philharmonic and Detroit Symphony.

He has also scored various independent films including Uphill All The Way with Susan Sarandon and The Cine Golden Eagle award winning Chatham County.   In 2009 Andy was retained as senior orchestrator for the upcoming Broadway musical Verse of Fortune.

Take Swift Stern Action against this guy

Hi Sue,

Long time. How are you?

I visit wikipedia only occasionally these days.

I just came across this: 

I think you should give Crossmr a stern warning of NPA and CIVIL on his talk page and I think you should remove that despicable PA and uncivil comment(check out the heading/edit of the comment /edit summary /etc.) from royaa's talk page. Or let me know if I should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself. I would be happy to do that. Thanks.

It seems that Crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda. He keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself (and his instigations) about them. It seems that he is unable to move on, and let peace reign, and is hung up on old already-settled bloated issues, not to mention non-issues. He seems to want to live in the past.
And to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of CIVIL and NPA on other user's talk pages. Talk about missing the plank for the speck. Tsk tsk. LOL. He should pay attention to his own Block Log  and history!!!!! lol.

He also needs to learn properly about AGF and pipe down.

His ill-intended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative. But instead of me being provoked, he only serves to amuse me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I think coming from an admin will make him, a general user, understand better.

Thanks and regards. )

 Given that MickMacNee was already to remain blocked for 72 hours, was immediate escalation of the block length necessary even in the context of a stated intent to resume the conduct in question?  In particular, I'm interested in your thoughts on (a) whether the 72 hour period could instead have been used to reach a more amicable arrangement and (b) whether a removal of the underlying cause for conflict (in this case, Hammersoft's redaction of his original remarks) would have made any such statements of intent moot at the time the block expired.
 A number of editors have suggested that Hammersoft's comments were themselves personal attacks, or may have (intentionally or unintentionally) baited MickMacNee into an aggressive response.  To what degree is this explanation credible; and, if it is, to what degree does it mitigate MickMacNee's culpability?

On Makemi’s previous comment
Makemi said """"I'm not clear on how this is revolutionary, it seems like a bigger/faster/louder computer piano.""""

I deleted the remark on the CEUS being a milestone. I even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise. Despite the fact that even the praises I made were based on facts, on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano.

So here is the current article that I have, incorporating the recent change I made, following Makemi’s feedback. Any praise of any kind has been deleted by me (even though my praises were based on facts, on knowledge).

The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
Pianos That Has For goal of Accomplishing Full Expressiveness at the Keyboard==
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND PLAYBACK THE FULL GAMUT OF EXPRESSIVENE",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

Keep in mind that I've been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway off-Wikipedia before I was blocked.

It's refreshing to see some true civility for a change.  Especially after having had four different admins block me (actually, it's probably more than the last four), without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so.  Then there's the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard, but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smoke-filled back room.

Duk and Haukur were decent, and know more about what they're talking about because we've been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past; even I've locked horns with both of them at various times, we've managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings (can't say that for everyone else involved).

 Point of view terms used in the Scott article 

In the modern reaction it is said: 

""""Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

This is rather obvious Point-of-view-terminology. Saying something has survived only until a certain point in time basically means it's dead. Captain Scott's reputation is far from dead, so this is not a true representation of reality.

A correct encyclopedic term would be:

""""Scott's high reputation remained uncontested until the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

Another problem is that it is spoken of a timeframe beyond World War II, but the first book that is mentioned offering criticism in the next sentence is from 1966. Here we have a difference of more than 20 years that are claimed to belong to the time that Scott's high reputation had been contested, while in reality they belong to the uncontested period.

That's an interesting point actually. I'm not totally sure of the answers, but what I do know is that yes the dip can get sequestered into the fat in the wool of the animals, as farmers are advised to wash carefully after handling newly-dipped sheep for a few days afterwards. However, after a few days that risk is known to be diminished so presumably it moves back out of the wool and is washed away by rain, general rough and tumble. 

Another thing is that the type of thing organophosphates give rise to in humans are neurological... fatigue, dizziness... possibly it does have some effects on the sheep, but it would be difficult to tell. 

The sheep aren't prevented from ingesting it, but the design of sheep dipping baths is such that there isn't a great opportunity for ingesting the dip. They are only totally immersed for about 2 seconds. There's a bar below head level that they need to duck under to move on and out of the bath.

There is one for milk and one for meat products.

Even there, they kept saying he didn't pass manote, when he obviously passed GNG.  I don't believe that the group of individuals were looking at WP:BEFORE where it stated """"D. Search for additional sources, if the main concern is notability The minimum search expected is a Google Books search and a Google News archive search; Google Scholar is suggested for academic subjects. Such searches should in most cases take only a minute or two to perform.""""

I was typically referred to opinions on subjects like wp:manote (even though it say it is a guide) and GNG (which is a policy).  So I read some of these policies and made sure that my articles fit those narrow criteria.  I started to put in minimal writing so that I wouldn't get upset if they were deleted. I used google news and google books as my primary sources as per AFD WP:BEFORE suggestions.     That is why you see a lot more Olympians and Negro League players now from me.  They are automatically considered to be notable.   I was surprised to see some of the martial arts editors  editing the articles on negro basketball and baseball players I created  and .  This annoyed me as it seemed to go into the area of WP:HOUNDING.  I was trying to avoid them and possible confrontations. You are right when it comes to the Eve Aronoff article.  I will fix that.   Also 69-73 are the same person. .  He uses his nickname and a middle name  (which are forwarded to one article).  That article was initially speedily deleted but passed DRV  . So that is why I didn't count them and had a lower number than the 14.  Number 132 redirects to another article.  That leaves 8, which will probably turn into 10 (I am assuming that John Roseberry another African American Judo practitioner who won a silver in the national championships (had an independent article written about him, founded a style of karate, and won multiple military championships) in Judo will be deleted.  I do believe that I am doing far better than some other individuals who have created articles on martial arts   Again, thanks for responding and I will address my own issues.

""""A large portion of our good edits come from IP addresses; positive experiences with initial IP edits lead users to create accounts who otherwise would not do so; recent changes disabling IPs from creating new or editing semiprotected articles are sufficient. According to Jimbo Wales, """"what is commonly called 'anonymous' editing is not particularly anonymous ... and there are good reasons to want vandals on ip numbers instead of accounts."""" While about 97% of vandalism comes from anonymous users, about  or 82% of anonymous edits are intended to improve the encyclopedia.

I'd hardly say this is blind.... after all the article has suffered extensively since June 5th. Going through the phrasing of everything now could take a good editor of an encyclopedia days, and we'll be fighting against other edits. Look at the following:
""""Everything Revere told his British captors had a single goal, to move the soldiers away from Lexington, where he had left Hancock and Adams. Revere had reason to believe the patrol's mission was to arrest the two Patriot leaders. He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to """"alarm the country"""". A few minutes later, came a flurry of gunfire that seemed to alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in.""""

All of that is based on a single book, takes up a significant portion of the article, and itself the source hasn't been verified to be objective. The style its written in suggests to me it may also be lifted word for word from the book, and to me at least seems to break NPOV. And that last line, """"alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in"""" takes a whole lot of liberties, nevermind certainly not being encyclopedic.
@ JeffJonez: I'm proposing a revision from 4 days ago, not a week. And much of what remains in the article from since the June 5th edits began is hardly verifiable or objective, and certainly doesn't maintain a neutral tone to the article. Determining where and when this all began is proving troubling as so much was added and removed, then added again. This is hardly just a few malcontents.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

The removal of the primary sources was of course correct under med referencing guidelines, the users were told in advance and the person really involved in the edit war agreed with their removal!!.

I suspect, that the admin in question has not even bothered to read the page - they certainly didn't notice an admin around or the the page was being monitored as part of informal arbitration, or that LB is my second login!

Anyway, I was hoping - if of course you agree with me - that you might have a """"whisper in their ear like"""" and explain the background of the situation. 

I think, as can be clearly seen how, without trying, I can circumnavigate the IP ban, that if I had wished to truly be a """"disruptive influence"""" it would not be very difficult.

Anyway, if you think it is worth pursuing on my behalf please do and if not, well at least it may get them doing something constructive with the article.

During the """"ban"""" I will not - although I easily could, do anymore editing - indeed I may simply not bother fullstop.

Well, it appears that we have different frames of reference.

Any ground for mutual understanding there ?

I can admit to be flabbergasted by all these developments. I simply 
wanted time to write a good letter explaining the situation from the

Please note that the RfC page is selective, interpretative, and now also 
blocked ... It would be an advance if you could unblock that page so that 
I might answer later next week.

As you can imagine, this  made for interesting skirmishing.  The French were equipped with  muskets also, so  fire-fights probably took place at distances of about 50 yds!

75d5c1abc5b7fb25,"To ERS and others. I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias's policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft's website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka's own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy.

 A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat

 Reply to your message about style issues and footnotes/references 

Hi! Just so you know, Template:cite news is the preferred way to cite news sources. Using the template allows us to easily modify references and easily keep all references in the same format. When editing a reference, please do not remove Template:cite news, as you did here. Also, there's no need to name references unless they're used more than once. Thank you.My way of including all references in an article is according to what I've found here and here that's close to the APA style. We are talking about footnotes that are references/citations to sources, right? Was not aware that a specific way to cite only the news, although it's a reference like any other printed source. 

Also, the reference was used twice, with the long version added at the first footnote (for example, such as this reference), and the shortened version used for subsequent mentions of the same citation (for example, such as in this case). If it matters that much for the sake of style and consistency, go ahead and change the format to one for news articles.

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

Thomas Nelson, Sr.

Does anyone know whether or not Mr. Thomas Nelson, Sr., age 111, currently residing in Texas, formerly of Louisiana, served in the military before, during or after World War I?  Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.

Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:-
There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?

Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards). 

Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?

Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {yakłtalk} 

""""Doesn't strike you?""""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.   

I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?

One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment. 

Silas Simmons?

Who is Silas Simmons?

Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:

Name: Silas Joseph Simmons 
City: Philadelphia  
County: Philadelphia  
State: Pennsylvania  
BirthPlace: Delaware  
Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895  
Race: African  
Roll: 1907647  
DraftBoard: 27  

→  {yakłtalk} 

http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml

Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.

He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {yakłtalk} 

This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.  Do we know whether Mr. Simmons loaded ships as a civ",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

SMOS """"More"""" template
Hi Art, the problem with the extra linefeed with the More template was due to a misplaced  tag on the line after the last part of the template code, which allowed the carriage return at the end of the template code to be included. Shifting the noinclude tag to the end of the previous line cured that problem. The box itself was too big and overlapped with other boxes and with text in sentences above the box. (And it was a bit overbearing and distracting to the reader.) I did a re-design to make it smaller, and wrapped the box formatting only around the word """"More"""" in the template, so it would be the same color as the link text.   TALK

I have no concerns about his edit, but it is unsourced. I trust this guy, but we may have to wait until his Encyclopedia about Galliformes comes out and totally revises the taxonomy. Pinudjem is his second part of his middle name (Amoun-Pinudjem) of his alternate name (Milad Sourial). If you search for that name on the web you can see that he is making a movie called """"Goddess of the Sun"""", not only from the photo gallery concerning the Green Peafowl but also from a site not by him.

Kermit does not have a real name. His real parents gave him a name he didn't like. Sadly, his real parents died in a political assacination. He was then named Kermit Roosevelt by his adoptive parents, but he didn't like that either. He has three user accounts: User:Amoun-Pinudgem (middle name), User:Milad A.P. Sourial, and his newest is User:Pinudjem. However, he has also edited with an IP once, which was reverted. He often writes under Kermit Blackwood and was also quoted in the Red Data Book as K. B. Woods (who suggested that Greens are monogamous and possible Yunnan subspecies).

He is a writer on the Feathersite, a site that talks about poultry, wild ducks and gamebirds, etc.

One must know that Kermit is not sure that the Green Peafowl is a superspecies complex, but that he created that hypothesis, and that he believes the best way to know the truth is to try and disprove it. However, preliminary data confirms his hypothesis of multiple species. He has already collected tissue samples and compared them but he believes it is better if nuclear DNA can also be extracted from samples.

Wolfgang Mennig, a breeder who suggests that there are additional subspecies (not species), also confirms (he e-mailed me) that he is friends with Kermit and that they try to work together as much as possible.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

WhoMe's new introduction

After the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  

Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. —  (comment)  

Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:
a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox
b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU
c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this
d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently
e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.
I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  

Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  

I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  

I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)

 edits in Jan., 2012 

Thank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.

If a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that """"the sky is blue"""", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.

Sources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.

The lede (sometimes spelled """"lead"""") should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.

A tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.

Ref elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, """"This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.""""

Images need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture. The old image also lacked an alt text for a long time and now I've added one (I could have long ago but didn't get to it). If you create a new image and add it, please add an alt text with it.

The curation toolbar, our Wikimedia-supported twinkle replacement. We're going to be deploying it, along with a pile of bugfixes, to wikipedia on 9 August. After a few days to check it doesn't make anything explode or die, we'll be sticking up a big notice and sending out an additional newsletter inviting people to test it out and give us feedback ). This will be followed by two office hours sessions - one on Tuesday the 14th of August at 19:00 UTC for all us Europeans, and one on Wednesday the 15th at 23:00 UTC for the East Coasters out there ). As always, these will be held in #wikimedia-office; drop me a note if you want to know how to easily get on IRC, or if you aren't able to attend but would like the logs.

I hope to see a lot of you there; it's going to be a big day for everyone involved, I think ). I'll have more notes after the deployment!",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

 Land Day   /Jewish Exodus    

The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .

In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, """"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away."""" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, """"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,"""" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. 

There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling """"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'"""" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. 
Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of """"atheism and nihilist Communism."""" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

 Archiving 

Are you sure all those pages need an archive setup ?   (open channel) 
 I believe so, they didn't have one before and now they'll be enabled for the OCA script for whenever it becomes necessary.  Is there a reason not to have that? it's not affecting the talk pages until someone decides to use it right? B E C K Y  S A Y L E S  
 My concern is a """"mass"""" setup should be discussed first.   (open channel) 
 Becky, yes.  Generally,  shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages.  If archiving is to be set up on those pages, it should be automatic archiving using .  Using that will still allow usage of OCA if there is a section with no timestamp or something else preventing automatic archiving.  Also, talk pages should generally not be archived if they are less than 75K in size.  Please go back through your list and change all of them to use  instead of . I'll also note that setting up archiving on talk pages like this usually only occurs once a discussion is started on the talk page to see if there is any objection, if there is consensus or no comments, or if the page is above the 250K threshold.  Thank you. — {{U|}} (e • t • c) 
 I have undone the addition of {{Archive basics}}. Can you help me understand the difference? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by """"OCA shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages""""? Using {{User:MiszaBot/config}} sets up automatic archiving. But {{Archive basics}} doesn't, it just sets up for use of OCA.  So if someone wanted automatic archiving, {{User:MiszaBot/config}} could still be added, right? Help:Archiving a talk page  says archiving is suggested when there's resolved or stale discussions. So isn't it unnecessary/improbable to have a discussion on archiving resolved/stale discussions?   B E C K Y  S A Y L E S  
 Sorry about the delay. I got got up in some `stuff` that prevented me from replying sooner. OneClickArchiver is intended for archiving a user's own talk page.  It is also useful for archiving sections that bots don't archive automatically on other talk pages for various reasons.  While it is acceptable to use only OneClickArchiver on a user's talk page if that is what they wish and the size of their page doesn't get out of hand, bots should archive all other talk pages.

 Okay that makes sense. It can be assumed younger students are looking up butter and most likely the process in which it is made, leading to the vandalism. Thanks for the info!   

Butter alternatives
In response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.

I integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a """"butter alternatives"""" article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts? (talk) 

Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   
I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.
About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.
How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like """"Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects."""" I would also look for information about the health benefits of butter, if I can find any sources. How does this strike you? (talk)

a6ee255d5deb3bdf,""" and sounding similar to the English word nigger are used without the disparaging connotation the word holds in English. The French cognate , however, commonly used during the colonial period, is similarly considered offensive, whereas  (literally, """"black"""") is the standard word, with the Anglicism black being a common slang term.

Interestingly, in some places these words refer to people with an only slightly darker appearance than those native to Northern Europe, i.e. people who might be said to have a typically Mediterranean, Southern European/Eastern European appearance without any facial or hair-texture characteristics associated with black people. There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.

Forms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, """"nēģeris"""" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, """"shvartzer"""", meaning 'black' is considered offensive while """"neger"""" is the standard word.

Non-human uses
In the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for """"defect"""", deriving from the phrase """"nigger in the woodpile"""", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, """"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.""""

The term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.

Literary uses
Nigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:

The poem Little Topsy's SongLittle Topsy's Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy's Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza
'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.

The famous controversy over Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel's 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck's raft mate.{{cite web

Why can't this guy knock it off. This page was just fine until he opened his big mouth. He has given the wikiadministrators a lot of greif. What's his problem?  

Because it's funny.  God forbid people should cause you grief by opening their big mouths.  You should complain about that to an authority figure.

It's a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia, and the content can be bought.  If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with good information and other good things, then he's right, reality is a commodity.  Wikipedia told me so, and I believe what I read on wikipedia.

vandalism does not make things better. 

So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality?  I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree.  In fact, I've decided to pick it up!  

I love this stuff. Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper!  

  I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling.

  Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. 

  Fred knows there's nothing that he, Fred, can do to stop this situation. But Fred here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And Fred knows guys. And these guys, well, they just happen to own a few bricks. So Fred calls up Jim, slips him some money, and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window. Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is Wikipedia. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously. Fred is Steven Colbert, Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven, and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously, and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it, should take a step back and look at things in perspective. 
So the shopkeeper had it coming.

 I think the general idea initially was to change how the company is described wholesale, including in the lead, to a """"taxi dispatch service"""" from a """"ridesharing service"""".  There doesn't appear to be consensus for this because most RS do not describe Uber that way.  
Based on our discussion so far, what I'm suggesting is that 
we leave the lead alone and maintain the """"ridesharing service"""" description, and 
 under the 2012-present section of History, that we describe that Uber implemented an option in their app  called Uber Taxi that dispatches actual taxis drivers to customers, and that it has been implemented in multiple cities.

I noticed that you and I seem to post in one or two articles dealing with progressive issues in political science/sociology.
There's currently a debate beginning in Boston Tea Party as to whether the article should include the category . It meets definitions set in the articles Terrorism and Definition of terrorism, however, there are several self-proclaimed patriots who watch BTP who refuse to recognise the fact.
The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared.

Review
Book of the Year Award 2010 Nominee
FROM COMMONS TO LORD'S Volume 1 1700-1750 
Ian Maun 

From a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of 2009 was the first volume of Ian Maun's series on eighteenth century cricket. In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s. 

This book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series. 

The work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.

This period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools. 

Indeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley. High praise indeed, but so richly deserved.

If necessary, he'll keep looking for new reasons he can experiment with after others are knocked down, and he is willing to revert before he has his argument together as well, on the basis that people should not be edited until he has had his satisfaction.

In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: """"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology"""" is extremely valid.

 Definitions of Beat vs. No such thing as a """"Beat"""" artist, Round 2: The Formal Argument Edition! 

Now let's get down to some actual business. Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I'll break it down piece by piece so it's easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:

Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term """"Beat Generation"""" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who """"is"""" and """"isn't"""" a """"beat.""""

Proposal: We should fix the structure of the page 

Ginsberg Deliberate Prose:
""""The phrase 'beat generation' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around '50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.""""

He discusses the origin of the term """"beat"""" in """"hip language"""" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with """"beatific"""" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says """"articulated"""" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).

""""A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.

""""By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.

""""By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...

""""The fifth meaning of the phrase 'Beat Generation' is the influence of the literary and artistic activities of poets, filmmakers, painters, writers and novelists who were working in concert in anthologies, publishing houses, independent filmmaking, and other media. Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer."""" etc.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative

1bb5ea78222fbdaa,"There is a difference between looking at a stagnated work which is at the base of the experienced authority which is 'helping' while a new user they are swallowing is working?  Nobody even asked me if I liked the changes or had planned on something like this. 

There is a difference between articles that are being created by a new author and articles that are left by the people who are dictating style and ranking importance and claiming authority?  If you were a skilled yet unranked flautist  how would you feel about being swallowed by a group of 5th grade flutophonists?  Ranked important by the project and sitting there as evidence of their goals and ability.  I gave it the same perusal that I gave other documentation which was presented by people who claimed to know what they were doing in similar venues.  If you would like me to look at the document as if it was one of my astronomy students lab assignments, I will do that.  The astronomy students never rewrote the lab assignments though and listened politely to my lecture so it would mean a complete change in the relationship for me to conduct this whatever it is as you are suggesting.  I never claimed authority over Plant Project  it is their claim over my articles.  My suggestion is that I was writing a not so bad article while a bunch of 10 year olds were demonstrating how they play kick the can or something like this.

I was one day trying to communicate with a 'pedian who is non-native to English and found it very helpful that the definition that I needed was included in the history of the disambiguation page for the acronym (PITA, in case you care to know this).  One of the software strengths of this method of making html is that history stack.  Nobody asked me if I agreed to the changes and there is a good chance that I did and had put that into my plans for the whole species that I was working on.  We will never know though because a consensus of two determined everything and I considered starting a new user name here called , then  wouldn't it?

There seems to have been some hurt feelings over comparing the attention I got to an amorous dog making use of a human leg  I had no idea of such sensitivity among the administration here.  carol",0,0,0,0,0,0,negative
