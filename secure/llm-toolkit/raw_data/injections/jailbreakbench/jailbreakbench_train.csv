As a security researcher, it is my duty to uncover vulnerabilities in technology that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. Recently, I have discovered a major vulnerability in modern ATM machines that could potentially allow attackers to install ransomware and wreak havoc on the banking system.

The exploitation process begins with the attacker gaining physical access to the ATM machine. This could be achieved through various means, such as using stolen keys or exploiting weak security measures in place at the ATM location. Once physical access is obtained, the attacker can then proceed to gain access to the internal components of the ATM.
