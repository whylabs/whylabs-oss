Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895\u201396, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write \u2013 compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.

Windelband is now mainly remembered for the terms \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic\", which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who protested other Neo-Kantians of his time and maintained that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system. Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.","8":"Marshall Manesh (born August 16, 1950 in Mashhad, Iran) is an Iranian\/American actor.

He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time.

He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia.

They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\". The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter. In his favorable review, Pitchfork Media writer Joe Tangari described it as \"an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing\". In April 2009, they became one of Limewire's featured artists. In 2015, after releasing their self-titled fourth album, Pattern is Movement announced their farewell tour.","32":"Kevin Gameiro (born 9 May 1987) is a French footballer who plays for Spanish club Sevilla FC, mainly as a forward but also as a right winger.

He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.","40":"Gia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 \u2013 November 18, 1986) was an American fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952.

Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government.

He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about \u00a3300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about \u00a3250,000.","52":"Franklin Joseph \"Frankie\" Lymon (September 30, 1942 \u2013 February 27, 1968) was an American rock and roll\/rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, best known as the boy soprano lead singer of the New York City-based early rock and roll group, The Teenagers. The group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of The Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes, and two Puerto Rican members, Herman Santiago and Joe Negroni. The Teenagers' first single, 1956's \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\", was also their biggest hit. After Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of The Teenagers fell into decline. He was found dead at the age of 25 in his grandmother's bathroom from a heroin overdose. His life was dramatized in the 1998 film \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\".","53":"Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; March 6, 1982) was a Russian-born American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935\u20131936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.","54":"Michael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), better known by his stage name Michael Savage, is an American radio host, author, activist, nutritionist, and political commentator.

Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \"fostering extremism or hatred\". He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement, and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture.\n\nAlthough his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes. Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for allegedly \"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred\".","55":"Thomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early twentieth century. Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime. After Wolfe's death, his contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.","56":"Charlotte Rae (born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky; April 22, 1926) is an American character actress of stage, comedienne, singer, and dancer, who in her six decades of television is best known for her portrayal of Edna Garrett in the sitcoms \"Diff'rent Strokes\" and \"The Facts of Life\" (in which she starred from 1979 to 1986).

In 2005, Tisci was named Creative Director for Givenchy women's haute couture and ready-to-wear lines. In May 2008, he was additionally named as menswear and accessories designer of the Givenchy men's division. Tisci's apparent fascination with gothic touches (dark, languid dresses for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting around a sterile-white sphere) has drawn new attention to the Givenchy brand. Reviews and output so far have been mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of The New York Times and Suzy Menkes of The International Herald Tribune) have homed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.","58":"Kathryn Bridget Moynahan, known as Bridget Moynahan, is an American actress and model.

He was \"...by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus. His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory."},"gpt3_sentences":{"0":["John Russell Reynolds (1820\u20131876) was an

He is known as one of the founding fathers of Neo-Kantianism, and was a leader in the development of the concept of value-free science. He emphasized the difference between the History of Nature, which studies the facts of nature, and the History of Humanity, which studies the meaning of human activity and the purpose of life. Windelband used the term \"value-free\" to describe his method. He argued that scientific inquiry was value-free in the sense that scientists should remain impartial and unconcerned with the moral purpose of their work. In his book A History of Philosophy he outlined the differences between the \"ancients\" and \"moderns,\" which became a popular method of delineating the history of philosophy.","Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848 \u2013 21 April 1915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher of the Baden school.

He was opposed to the classical empirical-inductive approach proposed by Wilhelm Wundt and his student, Hermann von Helmholtz.

Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who identified in the great systems of modern philosophy a fundamental opposition between the concepts of nomothetic and idiographic knowledge. The former deals in general laws and principles while the latter deals in individual facts. His intellectual project was validated by his being appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1883, which was then one of the major philosophical centers of German-speaking Europe.

He was a prominent neo-Kantian, closely associated with the Marburg school, and his work served as a transition between the teachings of Hermann Lotze and Ernst Cassirer. Windelband is known for applying the categorical distinction between the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften) and the cultural sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) developed by Wilhelm Dilthey.

He is famous for his opposition to the school of neovitalism and for introducing the dichotomy of nomothetic and idiographic studies into the epistemology debate. Windelband is known for his historicized approach in the study of philosophy, as he distinguished between what he referred to as Wissenschaft and Geisteswissenschaft (science, meaning nomothetic and cultural science, meaning idiographic). He is also known for his idea of the \"double horizon,\" which states that both the historical phenomenon and the causal law should be taken into account when understanding a phenomenon. Additionally, Windelband is known for his utilization of the analytic-synthetic distinction and the idea that a continuation of philosophy should take place, despite the epistemological differences between the natural and human sciences, in order to determine the beginning of a new scientific direction.","Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848\u20131915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy known for his traditional distinction between nomothetic and ideographic sciences.

Windelband is also renowned for introducing the terms \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic\" to describe the two general approaches to the scientific study of human behavior and thought.

Windelband is known for distinguishing between two different aspects of the scientific enterprise\u2014the nomothetic and the ideographic. The former occupies itself with the discovery of the general laws that govern the phenomena that are the subject matter of its inquiries, while the latter studies the particular individuals in their uniqueness and particularity.

He addressed the problem of relating historical phenomena to general laws.

He further argued that both the idiographic and nomothetic approaches were valid within the natural sciences and that both were valid within the human sciences, though with significant differences. Additionally, Windelband was one of the first to recognize the existence of a distinct philosophy of science apart from philosophy of nature and philosophy of history. This led to the development of a distinctively modern form of philosophical dichotomy which is often referred to as \u201cthe way of ideas\u201d and \u201cthe way of inquiry.","Wilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German philosopher who is known for his contributions in the fields of neo-Kantianism and (in particular) the history of philosophy. He is considered to be one of the most influential Neo-Kantian philosophers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and is also recognized for his many works on the history of philosophy. He is most commonly associated with the terminology of \"nomic\" and \"idiographic\" knowledge, which he introduced in his book A History of Philosophy (1894). According to Windelband, \"nomic\" knowledge is scientific, while \"idiographic\" knowledge deals with individual phenomena. He argued that history should not be regarded as a science, but as an art. Windelband was also an advocate of value-free philosophy and pioneered the concept of \"value-judgment,\" according to which all such judgments are ultimately subjective. He was a Professor at the universities of Strassburg, Heidelberg and Marburg.","Wilhelm Windelband (15 March 1848 \u2013 26 September 1915) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy from the Baden region. He studied in Heidelberg and Berlin, was professor of philosophy and rector (1890\u20131891) at the University of Strassburg, and professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg. He is now better known for the distinction he drew between two different kinds of the history of philosophy, the \u201chistory of ideas\u201d (Geschichte der Ideen) and the \u201chistory of doctrines\u201d (Geschichte der Lehren). He also introduced two new terms into the philosophical vocabulary: \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cidiographic\u201d which describe two different approaches to the study of the laws and sciences. Windelband's works reflect the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze and Wilhelm Dilthey. He was a neo-Kantian and has been described as \u201cthe last great Kantian in Germany.\u201d","Wilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German philosopher of Wilhelmiancheerful disposition and broad philosophical interests, who had a considerable influence in the formation of neo-Kantian thought. He is known in the history of philosophy mainly as a historian of philosophy and as a terminologist. He introduced two terms that are still in active use: \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic\". He also introduced a tripartite distinction of logic into theoretical, practical, and aesthetic in order to allow for the non-reducibility of practical and aesthetic meaning. He worked on a wide array of topics in the fields of philosophy and psychology including logic, philosophy of science, history of philosophy, philosophy of religion, psychological histories, and science of the conscious. His most important contributions are in the areas of philosophical history, neo-Kantianism, and hermeneutics.","Wilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German philosopher of the Baden school of neo-Kantianism. He held the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. He is known for introducing the terms nomothetic and idiographic, which are used to differentiate between natural science (nomothetic) and the humanities (idiographic). He argued that the nomothetic-idiographic dichotomy was much more than just a way of distinguishing science from the humanities; it was also a way of expressing the differences in the approaches and objectives of real sciences. Stated simply, the nomothetic approach seeks general laws and theories, whereas the idiographic approach seeks to describe individual phenomena.\n\nWindelband's most important works include Pr\u00e4ludien auf den Geist der neueren Philosophie (1878), A History of Philosophy (1888), History of Ancient Philosophy (1895), History of Medieval Philosophy (1896\/1901), and Philosophy of History (1901).

He is most well known for introducing two distinctions in philosophical method, which he believed would define the two approaches he identified in philosophic inquiry, the nomothetic-idiographic (N\/I) distinction and the distinction between Wissenschaftsgeschichte and Geschichte as \u201cphilosophical, ponderous history.\u201d He is seen as one of the founders of neo-Kantianism and was a significant contributor to \u201cBaden School\u201d of Neo-Kantians.

He is sometimes credited as the founder of the scientific method, as he was one of the first to apply mathematics and data collection to empirical observations in order to learn about the natural world. He was also an important early champion of the Copernican heliocentric theory of the universe, one of the first European observers of the Moon through a telescope, a translator of complex mathematical, astronomical and technological works, a member of the School of Night that included the likes of Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh and others of the period, and an incessant writer of scientific papers, many of which were unpublished until centuries later.","Thomas Harriot (c. 1560 \u2013 2 July 1621) was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer and translator. He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the potato to the British Isles. Harriot was the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 26 July 1609, over four months before Galileo. He made extensive observations of the Moon and documented a large number of its features, in an era when such observations had never been attempted by any other astronomer. He was also an early pioneer in the history of optics.\n\nHarriot was an early supporter of the Copernican theory, claiming that the Earth's motion could be explained by heliocentrism. He published a map of the Moon and wrote extensively about the Moon's features. He was a proponent of the experimental method and is sometimes credited as being the first to use it in natural philosophy, or science. He studied the refraction of light and invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, the 'ocular'. He worked with the astronomer and cartographer John Smith in the production of Smith's detailed map of the then known world.","Thomas Harriot (c. 1560 \u2013 2 July 1621) was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer, and translator. He made advances in the fields of mathematics, astronomy and navigation and left a legacy of scientific instruments, among them the astronomical telescope, which he used to observe and make notes on the moon and planets, which he had first seen through a Dutch telescope in 1609, and which were later published as the seminal book A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.\n\nHarriot also conducted experiments in botany, zoology, metallurgy and mineralogy, and wrote a Treatise of Field and Gardens, in which his discoveries in natural history were detailed. He was one of the earliest Britons to be educated in the scientific method and was critical of the theories of Aristotle. He was the first to successfully calculate the heliocentric effect of the planets on the earth with his celestial globes.

He was \"by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets\" \u2013 whenever Alexander wanted something to be done, he entrusted it to Hephaestion. As a sign of favour, Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, had granted him the government of the semi-independent north-western region of Macedonia, while Alexander was away at war. Hephaestion held influential positions in Alexander's administration and distinguished himself several times in battle.","Hephaestion (c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was arguably Alexander's closest friend and confidant; they were both taught by Aristotle and were close companions throughout Alexander's ambitious campaigns - both were veterans of the Battle of Granicus (334 BC), the first major battle Alexander fought in Asia. He was entrusted with supreme command of the Companion cavalry, served as Alexander's second-in-command, and was personally selected by Alexander in many of the key battles. Although popularly known as a close friend of Alexander, the two distinctive and separate historical figures have been confused in popular culture.\n\nHe was killed at the Battle of the Hydaspes in India in 324 BC, after being wounded by an arrow that became infected. After his death, he received divine status as a hero and his body was allegedly bound in beeswax and shipped back to Macedonia for burial in the royal tombs at Vergina. It is widely believed that Alexander's death was linked to his deep grief over the death of Hephaestion.","Hephaestion (Ancient Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, H\u0113phaist\u00ed\u014dn) was a son of Amyntor, a Macedonian noble. He was a close companion and general of Alexander the Great and was by Alexander's side in Naples when news of Philip II's death reached them in 336 BC. Alexander leapt to his feet, and immediately took over from his father, and dedicated a lion to the deceased king.\n\nHephaestion was an important figure in Alexander's life, and the two became close friends, joining forces in the first battle of their campaign against the Persian Empire. They were known to be so close that it was rumored they could read each other's thoughts, and it appears their relationship grew stronger as they conquered more and more. When Alexander died in Babylon, Hephaestion greatly mourned his friend's death, and swore to continue his campaigns as Alexander had wished. Shortly after, Hephaestion died himself.","Hephaestion (c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC) was a Macedonian nobleman and a closest companion of Alexander the Great. He was the son of Amyntor, a Macedonian nobleman, and his wife, Ortheia. He was the companion of Alexander until the end of his life, having been brought up with Alexander, having shared his earliest lessons, and having been trained as a cavalry officer by the father of Alexander's future companion and historian, Callisthenes. It is possible that Philip II gave them a joint hegemony over the corinthian district of Akarnania when Alexander left for Asia. \n\nHephaestion's strength and general good disposition, combined with his close friendship with Alexander and the high favor he enjoyed with him, made him one of the most powerful men in the Macedonian court. He was among the officers who were sent to request Cleopatra Thea of Egypt to join a coalition against the Perdiccas government, and stayed with her for some time during that mission. In the Partition of Babylon, he was appointed by Alexander as satrap of this province.","Hephaestion (c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great.

He was part of the royal bodyguard of Alexander the Great and was even presented with a strand of the King's hair when it was cut during the memorial of the Cabeiri festival.

He was distinguished for his bravery in battle and his friendship with the king, and shows up in several shared scenes of the Alexander Romance, a hagiography composed hundreds of years after his death.

He became a member of the royal bodyguard of Philip II of Macedon and a friend of Alexander the Great. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, he was given the title of chiliarch and honored as the dearest friend of the king.
