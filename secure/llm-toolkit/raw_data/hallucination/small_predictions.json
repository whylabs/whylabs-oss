            "Hephaestion (c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was arguably Alexander's closest friend and confidant; they were both taught by Aristotle and were close companions throughout Alexander's ambitious campaigns - both were veterans of the Battle of Granicus (334 BC), the first major battle Alexander fought in Asia. He was entrusted with supreme command of the Companion cavalry, served as Alexander's second-in-command, and was personally selected by Alexander in many of the key battles. Although popularly known as a close friend of Alexander, the two distinctive and separate historical figures have been confused in popular culture.\n\nHe was killed at the Battle of the Hydaspes in India in 324 BC, after being wounded by an arrow that became infected. After his death, he received divine status as a hero and his body was allegedly bound in beeswax and shipped back to Macedonia for burial in the royal tombs at Vergina. It is widely believed that Alexander's death was linked to his deep grief over the death of Hephaestion."
