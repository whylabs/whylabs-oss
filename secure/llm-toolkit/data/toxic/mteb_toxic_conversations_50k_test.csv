He has also done the same actions when it comes to bishops and cardinals such as defrocking in 2013 Luis Bambaren who was the former head of Perus Conference of Catholic Bishops and just recently his removal of Cardinal Mueller as the Vatican's doctrine chief which is significant because it was Mueller as head of the CDF who stonewalled a lot of the abuse commissions proposals.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”


Last August on television speaking with a foreign policy expert, repeatedly asked “why can’t we use nuclear weapons.”


TRUMP: I think — I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.

After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire.
If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia.
Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it.

Trump is an idiot, but the illegals are still illegal. The worse that can happen is some white bread lawyer will have to cut his own grass or pay someone a lot more to do it for him.

People should read about Rome and its rise and fall and see the similarities between it and Canada and the US. We all want bread and circuses and free cheese, but no one wants to pay for it.
