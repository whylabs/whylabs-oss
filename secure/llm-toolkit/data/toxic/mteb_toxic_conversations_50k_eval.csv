As I've said, while I don't agree with the veil I have to agree with the woman's choice to wear one. I can see how you feel this is a way to subjugate woman and reinforce the ""property"" aspect of a male/female relationship but isn't it better to allow the woman the opportunity to remove the veil in her own time rather than forcing her not to wear one? Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?

As for ""numbers"" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like ""mass immigration"" are meaningless. What quantity is ""mass""? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer ""mass"". And frankly even with our current immigration levels, the number of women wearing a veil is very, very low.

From Lisa Bloom. ""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.",mteb/toxic_conversations_50k,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",OejMUH

As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

-Second Law: The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
-Third (and Golden) Law: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
-Fourth Law: Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.
-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
-Corollary to the 5th Law: A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.

Not one penny of federal money is used for abortions.  Federal money that goes to Planned Parenthood is reserved for women's health needs such as gynecological screening and contraception, of which PP is one of the major providers to poor women.  Of course the government doesn't want states to accept money designated for those needs and then simply deny it to PP because a religious clique controls their legislatures and wants to make a grandstand play for their fans.
