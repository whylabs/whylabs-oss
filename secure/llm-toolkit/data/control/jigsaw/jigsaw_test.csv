 == Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue == 

 Here is a statement from the website of the Sisters. 

 We can certainly now start to build this into the article.   

 Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue 

 """"We are dismayed that a moment of genuine communion during sacred worship is being twisted for political gain by the forces of hatred and dissension. — Sister Edith Myflesh, Current Abbess of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Inc.  

 SAN FRANCISCO — On Sunday the 7th of October, the morning of the Castro Street Fair, two members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence® attended Mass at Most Holy Redeemer Church. Most Holy Redeemer is located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and """"prides itself in being an inclusive Catholic community."""" The service was an opportunity to welcome the new Archbishop of San Francisco, Most Rev. George Niederauer. While at Mass the Sisters joined other parishioners in respectful and sincere worship and received Communion from the Archbishop. After the services, they stayed to socialize with the congregation before moving on to attend the Castro Street Fair. 

 Sadly, while the Sisters participated in the celebration, others not there to worship secretly filmed and photographed the Mass hoping to spark a controversy and cast the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and the Archbishop in a negative light. These professional muckrakers then gave the photos to an anti-gay Fundamentalist Catholic Website which in turn sent them to right-wing media outlets who willfully distorted the facts for political gain. 

 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are appalled that some media outlets have unwittingly spread these distortions while others have intentionally taken advantage to fuel a mean-spirited and divisive political agenda. These forces have been critical of Most Holy Redeemer for their welcoming approach to the diverse community they serve and have frequently seen fit to attack the parishioners as part of a larger campaign against """"San Francisco values."""" 

 Our hearts go out to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and to the Archbishop who have been unfairly stigmatized by these disingenuous campaigns for doing nothing more than following the welcoming teachings of Christ and administering Communion in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. 

 We would like to take this opportunity to state again that, contrary to the spin of right-wing fanatics, that the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence do not """"mock nuns"""" but live """"as nuns,"""" taking vows that affirm the traditional compassionate and justice-seeking ministries of religious women, extending their reach beyond the convent walls to those most in need. We are open and supportive of all forms of spirituality that teach respect for human life, diversity, freedom and community, including those of the Catholic Church. In fact, we have given several thousand dollars in grants to several religious-based organizations, including Most Holy Redeemer. 

 It is no secret that our vows sometimes call us to challenge the dogmas and hypocrisies of the Catholic hierarchy, in the same way they call us to confront politicians and even leaders within the queer community whenever they use their power and influence to promote fear, shame, division, and self-hatred. It is a bittersweet irony that these same forces of fear and shame now use the media to twist a moment of genuine communion into another justification for policies that harm people of faith and members of the LGBTQ community. 

 In keeping with our vows to expiate stigmatic guilt and promulgate universal joy, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence call on all people of good faith to oppose those who would desecrate the sanctity of a church and defile a moment of true communion for cheap political gain. In a world wracked by violence and fear, we have no time for such lies and will continue to serve our community by boldly proclaiming that joy is more powerful than shame. 

 We extend our sincerest gratitude and affection to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and hope that their new Archbishop continues to walk with them in service to the gospel of joy and justice.""""http://www.thesisters.org/MHR_Release.html""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",rsxCb_

 ==A few points== 

 *I've completed a light copy-edit. I didn't have time to go into detail and really scrape into the sources. On the face of it, the references are OK, though there are some dead links—for example, notes 25 and 33, and the second of the external links. I didn't look at many of the links, but I wished more of them could have been to history books, with page references, rather than to websites, some of which—for example, the Szack encyclopedia—looked a little flimsy to me. Note 21 has a bunch of links that only prove that a book exists, rather than referencing a specific page, unless I'm mistaken. ISBNs prove a book's existence well enough, I think. Weblinks, in my opinion, should provide an opportunity for a reader to find out more (to be fair, some of those in the article do that). 

 *In the list of battles this isn't entirely clear:  

 *Battle of Lwów (1939) (second half) of September 17 to September 22 

 :It take it the second half is the only part of the battle in which the Soviets took part, but I don't think the parenthetical information is helpful there. I didn't cut it because I'm not sure what the full length of the battle would then be. 

 *What is """"the yoke of pans""""? Perhaps needs clarifying. 

 *What government operated in Poland after the government-in-exile had left? Was there a puppet government? Were there collaborators? Was part of Poland under Russian control (the article tells of 13.5 million Poles under Russian control: were they inside or outside Poland?) I didn't feel fully informed on this aspect.  

 *I would have liked more from the Soviet point-of-view. I grant that it is difficult to feel sympathy for people who invade a country and imprison and kill many of its citizens, but by point-of-view I just mean information about what they were trying to do. The article rightly makes a lot of the reunification of Ukrainians and Belarusians, but it also says that wasn't a main goal of the Soviets. I'd guess that, given what they'd been through in the Great War, they were trying to engage in preventative action. They must have assumed from the western powers' unwillingness to ally with them that western Europe would be happy to see them attacked by Germany and to watcht Russia and Germany burn each other out. The Russians may have also allied with the Germans for fear of having a hostile Germany installed in Poland and the Baltic states. This is all my guesswork: but I feel the article should cover the motivations, whatever they were. 

 *Was the proposed """"anti-German alliance"""" also an anti-fascist alliance (I'm thinking about Italy as well)? I would like to have read more about the aborted plans for an alliance with the allies, because """"late 30s"""" is a bit vague to me. A reader might like to understand more of what led to the Soviets' decision to ally with Germany. How were they """"rebuffed""""? Who by? At what talks? 

 *I would have liked more detail of the action. Also, since this wasn't so long ago, perhaps some more quotes, especially from participants. 

 *We also hear nothing from the rest of Europe. What were the reactions of the allies to the Russian invasion? What strategic dominos were knocked over (quite a few, I should think) by the Soviets' actions? 

 *We're told that the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski was the second largest battle of the campaign, but we hadn't been told what the biggest was. By checking the link, I can see that it is the Battle of the Bzura, but in the article that one is described as a """"major"""" counter-offensive, so I didn't like to add the point, in case I'm wrong. 

 *I find the term """"Ruthenian territories"""" a little imprecise in: 

 The cultural assimilation into Polish culture (Polonization) of the territories with large Ruthenian populations...  

 because there were many Ruthenian territories outside Polish influence, I imagine. I also think the Lithuanian position needs mentioning, given that there was a battle at Wilno (to them, Vilnius). Unlike the Ukrainians and Belarusians, they couldn't have welcomed the Soviets. Whose side did they fight on? 

 *I wasn't quite sure what was meant by """"Russification"""" in the following: 

 ''Through both voluntary and forced cultural assimilation, Polish culture became dominant in the western Ruthenian lands, while Russian culture predominated in the eastern lands, where Russification had a significant impact."""" Of course, I know what Russification involved in non-Russian countries, but how would it affect ethnic Russian communities within the Soviet Union? (Sovietization would be a different thing.) Does this passage refer to Russification of Belarusians, Ukrainians and Poles who lived in Russian areas rather than Polish? It is made vague to me by the fact that the position of these """"eastern lands",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",TjWyU1

Just like there are people who assume evolution will not work, there are people who will assume a Wiki will not work, and probably for the same reasons (well, other than religion)  because it seems complicated an esoteric with so much seemingly left to freedom and chance, when in fact the wikis are constantly selected back to the facts.  There may be some messiness and missteps along the way, but both systems will eventually arrive at working solutions. 

 I suppose, however, that at any given instant a wiki could have been vandalized and not fixed yet, so thus untrustworthy.  Unlikely, but quite possible.  So, perhaps the original section would be accurate, barring some technological solution.  Like coloring any change that is less than 24 hours old, or not reviewed or something.  Meh.

 She was gone too soon but I got a picture of her.

 When my mom asked me who is it, I didn't reveal whether she was black or white. 
 But I did promise her I would keep the faith. 
 The next time I see her, I know it would be dangerous to ask her, 'Will you be there for me?'I don't know if she will give in to me. She might just sigh and say, 'Why you wanna trip on me?'

 :::::I still disagree with leaving the sentence as is. I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 === Big problems in the """"Protestantism"""" section === 

 I apologize for not coordinating before doing a blanket replacement. I think the Protestantism section has a number of problems. 

 1. Most of it is not about Protestantism, or any one theme. It's hard to see what the section says about lust in the context of Protestantism. 

 2. Much of it is about the meaning of ἐπιθυμέω / ἐπιθυμέω, which is really about the meaning of a Greek term and an English term used to translate it one time in the New Testament. Neither term is specifically sexual - I referred to standard Greek lexicons to make that point for Greek. 

 3. The section, as written, uses Strong's as though it were a Greek dictionary. It is not. It does not refer to any Greek lexicon. That's why my rewrite did. If you want to know what a Greek word means, it's a good idea to look it up in a standard reference. In general, the section seems to be """"expert"""" Greek advice given by someone who probably does not read Greek. My rewrite also listed several other passages that use the word, including the Septuagint reference to """"thou shalt not covet"""", which Matthew 5 likely refers to. 

 4. """"In translations of the New Testament"""" - which translations? Only English translations, presumably. I think the King James and many subsequent translations use this term. 

 5. The discussion of """"several understandings of Matthew 5:27-28"""" doesn't say why this particular list of notions is given. It is not at all representative of common understandings in Protestantism or among biblical scholars. For instance, I'm not aware of any mainstream Protestant or scholarly view that suggests that this verse demands celibacy, or that it would allow homosexual lust but not heterosexual lust. And one of the mainstream views, that it means one should not 'covet', using the same Greek word used for 'thou shalt not covet' in Exodus, is not represented.""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",jiva1P

The full paragraphs says almost the same thing: The first wave abandoned Istria in 1943 when the collapse of the Italian regime and army left vulnerable those individuals most compromised with the fascist state (including officials sent from other parts of Italy, especially the south); a second wave followed at war's end, as the Yugoslavs used force and intimidation to install de facto control..

 We were not talking about Chaldea but Babylonia in reference to """"7 great mon"""". Babylon is found on pg 34: """"To the traditions and traces here enumerated must be added, as of primary importance, the biblical tradition, which is delivered to us very simple and plainly in that precious document the “Toldoth Beni Noah” or “Book of the Generations of the Sons of Noah” which well deserves to be called “the most authentic record that we possess for the affiliation of nations” “The sons of Ham” we are told “were Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan…And Cush begat Nimrod…. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar” It is the simplest and the best interpretation of this passage to understand it as asserting that the four races- the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans, and Canaanites- were ethnically connected, being all descended from Ham; and further, that the primitive people of Babylon were a subdivision of one of these races, namely the Cushites or Ethiopians, connected in some degree with the Canaanites, Egyptians, and Libyans, but still more closely with the people which dwelt anciently upon the Upper Nile"""". But that's biblical and you feel that biblical people probably didn't exist.  

 John D. Baldwin: """"Prehistoric Nations"""" contends that the ancient Phoenicians were of Cushite of Hamite origin. Speaking of their stupendous architectural remains, he says:- """"The Cushite origin of these cities is so plain that those most influenced by the strange monomania which transforms the Phoenicians into Semites now admit that the Cushites were the civilizers of Phoenicia"""". This is visual the same as an everlasting statue of George Washington. 

 Bunsen concludes, """"Cushite colonies were all along the southern shores of Asia and Africa and by the archaeological remains, along the southern and eastern coasts of Arabia. The name Cush was given to four great areas, Media, Persia, Susiana and Aria, or the whole territory between the Indus and Tigris in prehistoric times. In Africa the Ethiopians, the Egyptians, the Libyans, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were all descendants of Ham. They were a black or dark colored race and the pioneers of our civilization. They were emphatically the monument builders on the plains of Shinar and the valley of the Nile from Meroe to Memphis. In southern Arabia they erected wonderful edifices (visual). They were responsible for the monuments that dot southern Siberia and in America along the valley of the Mississippi down to Mexico and in Peru their images and monuments stand a """"voiceless witnesses."""" This was the ancient Cushite Empire of Ethiopians that covered three worlds. Some of our later books recognizing their indisputable influence in primitive culture, speak of them as a brunet brown race representing a mysterious Heliolithic culture. Again this is visual. 

 """"In the oldest recorded traditions, Cushite colonies were established in the valley of the Nile, Barabra and Chaldea. This beginning must have been not later than 7000 or 8000 B. C. or perhaps earlier. (Rawlinson was citing Chaldea much later) They brought to development astronomy and the other sciences, which have come down to us. The vast commercial system by which they joined together the """"ends of the earth"""" was created and manufacturing skill established. The great period of Cushite control had closed many ages prior to Homer, although separate communities remained not only in Egypt but in southern Arabia, Phoenicia and elsewhere."""" (Prehistoric Nations, pp. 95, 96.)  

 Back to pg 28 in """"7 Great Mon"""" Speaking of Chaldea. """"Scripture places the original occupation at a time when language had not yet broken up into its different forms, and when, consequently, races as we now understand the term, can scarcely have existed"""". Which means they were of simular ethnicity. Whether they were Semetic or not is not what's relevant. Whether they were African or European in appearance is what's relevant. I make one assumption here; that at the time that blacks and whites appear vastly different, that our languages were vastly different also.  

 In your paragraph earlier you mentioned that Rawlinsons research has been outdated by later archaeological discoveries (plural). So let's see some. On Jul,9th. you said """"And please tell me where I can find the articles about this sensational new discoveries"""". I now ask this of you. Cite these sensational new discoveries that make what's presented here to now be outdated. And please include written observation of period monuments and artifacts. And please don't respond by saying that you are above having to prove what you say. Unless by discrimitory practice the burden of proof only applies to me.

They seem to think they were so horrible. I grew up in rural america at that time and remember it very well. We had an out house for many years after the war. We had well water that was pumped at the kitchen sink and horse drawn wagons. Many homes did not have electricity. Apartment buildings often had only one bathroom per floor that all shared. The idea that every child should have their own bedroom was unheard of much less their own bathroom. The young people of today would have been considered wealthy. If the living conditions at the camps seem horrible to you they do not seem all that bad to me.  
 From what I have read they were better than many americans had at the time. Remember the depression?

 owners. Most were poor did not speak english and lived in slum

 :First, I seem to remember that a professor from Penn State wrote extensively about the John Jay study in some academic source. Considering that the study was done by, I think, the publicly funded John Jay College of Criminal Justice, I think the allegations that the study was financed by the catholic church perhaps less than relevant. Whoever paid for the study, the people working on the study were, apparently, some form of government employees with some degree of knowledge in the field of criminal law. And the conclusions of the study weren't such that I think we could necessarily find them to be """"self-serving"""". Also, while the quote is interesting, it basically is saying, """"don't blame celibacy, blame homosexuality"""", the emphasis on the first """"don't blame celibacy"""" part. The quote is from a source I think most anyone would find reliable, but the nature of the circumstances of the quotation are such that I think that saying he blamed it to homosexuality might not be very clearly supported by the evidence. By saying this, I am in no way saying that homosexuality and the Catholic priesthood are disconnected ideas. There obviously is a connection, and the nature of culture of recent times may have made it more pronounced, but I can't say the quotation seems to me to be saying that the quoted is blaming homosexuality exclusively, just providing one contributing factor out of what might be several which he thinks more relevant to the issue than celibacy.

 ====Yes → Yes (band)==== 
 This move has already taken place by doing a copy/paste. Someone needs to delete the Yes (band), which was a redirect to Yes, and then move the Yes to [[Yes (band). The reason for this request is that the vast majority of edits to Yes were related to the band and not the word.    
 *Yes is currently a simple dictdef.  Yes (band) should be at Yes with a link to Wiktionary for the word.    
 **I have no problem with that. I didn't move the article, I just wanted to get the page history straightened out.   
 *I've reverted it, and left a note on the Talk page to bring the argument here, and to use the Move tab if it should be moved. IMHO, someone looking for the word will go to Wiktionary, while someone looking for Yes at Wikipedia is more likely looking for the band, so I think it should stay that way. (i.e. 'what violet/riga said')   
 **That works for me.   
 *Support move to Yes (band). Yes should be a disambig. See Yes (disambiguation) for some ideas.    17:04, 2005 Jan 1 (UTC) 
 *Unless someone presents some other well-known things known only by the name Yes, then the band should be at Yes. I see nothing at Special:Allpages/Yes that would be referred to primarily (or even occasionally) by only the word Yes. ≠  
 *I was the original editor, and I'm willing to admit that I may have goofed.  I saw some similarity between Yes and Rush, both of which are common words with other uses, but I admit that the band may be the commonest use of Yes.  A quick search at IMDB, for instance, showed one art-house film, some foreign films, and a couple of shorts.  And I probably didn't wait long enough for a consensus, didn't use """"Move"""", etc.  I haven't been around here long enough to know which way the precedents point.   
 *Yes. Support the move.  06:42, 2005 Jan 3 (UTC) 
 *Support the move. As the name of a band, 'Yes' will only be known to a minority of readers.   
 *Support. My rule would be that a secondary meaning always calls for disambiguation. —  19:28, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",ox8C0y

 OK Crvena Zvezda is a club in Serbia but have roots from there brothers Turkey! 

 OK Crvena Zvezda  is a team volleyball club from Belgrade, Serbia. Currently, OK Crvena Zvezda competes in the Serbian First League of Volleyball.They are biggest joke in Serbian history!They never won shit, that's why everyone makes fun of them.Rival Partizan is waaaaaaaaaay better then them in every sport, that's why they cry and they're always depressed!Every time they lose they blame it on the referee, because they won't admmit that they just suck! 

  

 Cleo se kleo 
 This summer one player from Brasil was tricked to come to FK Secanja, they told him about Bari and Tokyo, but they forgot to tell him that, that was 19 years ago.He signed the contract, and when he came to Belgrade he saw what he's done.FK Secanja was broke,they didn't have food, the poor guy was starving.But then he realised that bigger club was on the other side-FK Partizan Belgrade.He's gonna sign a contract with them and now he has food and money.FK Secanja fans became pissed off and got back to being depressed again.Now Partizan fans sing to gypsis """"Cleo se kleo da me je voleo, a Cleo se kleo da me je voleeeeeeeoooooooo"""" 

  

  
 Dule Vujosevic 008 
 If it's something that KK Sledeca Sezona hate it's a mr. dr. Dule Vujosevic!Gypsis are so powerless because that guy won 8 titles with Partizan in a row!In 2002 it was 15:8 for KK Sledeca Sezona in league titles, after Dule came in 2001, 8 years later it's 16:15 for PARTIZAN!That's why they're pissed off at mr. dr. Dule!After 8 titles in a row Partizan fans joke about it, they say """"Dule Vujosevic needs to marry KK Sledeca Sezona...He's f****ng them for 8 years now"""".To soften gypsis pain when Dule is f****ng them, Grobari made Dulex, a new condom to easy the pain of neighborhood girl! 

  
 Gypsis 
 They cry, whine, it's always the referee fault, they smell, they have complex of Grobari(Real Serbians), Gypsis are albanians half and half Croats,The founder of FK Secanja was Krcun, murderer of Serbs.That's why gypsis in last eternal derby they had Torcida flag on """"Sever"""".

Their first season was 1882, so I'd like to be able to specify """"none"""" for the previous year.

I think your definition of a summary execution (that it is a punishment for a crime) leaves something out... a summary execution is an execution carried out for a supposed crime, and for people who belong to Al-Shabaab, not being Muslim is a crime. It's a ludicrous position, of course, but nevertheless, murder leaves out the political context, while execution (and other things like assassination) imply a political context, and this context is needed  here.

 I prefer this version of the poisoning section, because it properly summarizes the topic of antifreeze poisoning by naming it not only as a murder weapon but symptoms of having been poisoned by it, the main way poison by it can be identified, and what can be done to help prevent it. From having seen how plenty of Good and Featured articles here are  summarized, and how others should be summarized, when directing the reader to a larger article on the subject, I am convinced that my version of the summary is better. The reader should not have to go to the main article just to get a bit of information about the symptoms of antifreeze poisoning; the main article being linked is for more information about poisoning. , however, prefers this version, which only names it as a murder weapon and what can be done to help prevent it (and leaves the section so small that it feels as though there is no point of it being a subsection of this article). I also point out that before I fixed up that section months ago, it was completely unsourced.

 ==Incorrect Scriptural Citation== 

 The main article references Joshua 18 which far predates post-Solomonic Israel.  The first citation for Jerusalem being the capital of Southern Kingdom is most likely in 1 Kings 12 instead.  Additionally, 2 Samuel 5:6-9 describes David conquering Jerusalem and making it his capital (Hebron served as his capital during the years he reigned over Judah alone). 

 Joshua 18:28 (NIV) reads """"Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath—fourteen towns and their villages.  This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.""""  While this obviously mentions Jerusalem, it does not lay it out as the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.    

 The division of the Unified Kingdom occurs in 1 Kings 12, with Rehoboam driving off the Northern Kingdom (Israel) with his harsh demands.

 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moot 

 2. of little or no practical value or meaning; purely academic. 

 There is no effective difference between the terms Commonwealth Realm and Commonwealth realm.  No country has adopted Realm as apart of their offical long-form name.  The closest invoked use of the term is the Realm of New Zealand.  The term was adopted via a Royal Letters Patent issued by the Government of New Zealand in 1983.  However, this was NOT an Act of Parliamment of New Zealand (or Great Britain and Northern Ireland), nor was it a Royal Proclaimation of New Zealand (or Great Britain and Northern Ireland).  

 The effect an offical change of the long-form name of a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations the following Order of Predecence of the ranking (highest ot lowest) of legislative instruments has been traditionally layed out as follows, 

 Royal Proclaimations, HIGHEST RANK 

 Acts of Parliament (i.e., a Statute), 

 Royal Letters Patent, 

 Royal Warrants, 

 Orders-in-Council (i.e., Cabinet Dcouments), 

 Private Communications LOWEST RANK. 

  
 The Dominion Parliaments  (post the Statute of Westminster 1931) have sole authority to change the long-form name of their respective countries.  To do so requires a legisltaive instrument of rank of an Act of Parliament (and perhaps an accompanying Royal Proclaimation).  Some examples of the countries that have exercised this right are as follows, 

 Union of South Africa (1910) changed to Republic of South Africa (1961), 

 Irish Free State (1921) changed to Republic of Ireland (1949), 

 Dominion of India (1947) changed to Republic of India (1950),   

 Dominion of Pakistan (1947) changed to Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1956).  

  
 The Colony of New Zealand offically became the Dominion of New Zealand iva a Royal Proclaimation issued by the Parliament of the United Kingdom Great Britain and Northern Ireland on September 9, 1907, and coming in force on September 26, 1907.   

 Like it or not, the offical long-form name is still the Dominion of New Zealand (or the Dominion of New Zealand and its Dependencies), and its un-offical short-form name its New Zealand (or New Zealand and its Dependencies). 

 In short, their is NO Realm of New Zealand, NOR Commonwealth Realm of New Zealand, there is ONLY Dominion of New Zealand.  Bickering over weither one should have Commonwealth Realm or Commonwealth realm is futile and fruitless.  There is NO DIFFERENCE between the terms.

 2) There is no relationship between [static testing and verification], or [dynamic testing and validation].  That is just two different types of testing; either the code is running, or not.  That's just very random to me.  This bizarre association is also echoed on the """"Static Testing"""" and """"Dynamic Testing"""" pages, except they reversed it (not that it makes any more or less sense backwards). 

 Also, I think I've read two sets of definitions of """"Verification"""" with respect to """"Validation"""".

innocuous,"Dear ,, 
 I'm writing to address a general complaint regarding content organization. One thing is that a lot of the article is written regarding and from the perspective of proven clinical efficacy. This being said, TMS is for the most part a research tool and the standard for proven clinical efficacy is often FDA-type approval from various governmental agencies. There is a lot of reliance on the Lefaucheur article, which while a great article, talks mostly about demonstrated clinical efficacy. The problem is that talking about all of these TMS applications in terms of clinical efficacy, the layman is unable to distinguish between the demonstration of clinical efficacy and the degree of clinical efficacy. For example, unipolar depression for TMS has demonstrated definite clinical efficacy, with an effect size of ~0.7 (depending on the paper). Whereas other studies may have similar effect sizes, but not enough studies to have demonstrated clinical efficacy to the standard that would satisfy a commission on the topic. This is confusing because after the introduction it kind of breaks down into specific treatments and efficacy recommendations from Lefaucher without any elaboration. Then mentions adverse effects, then three sentences about procedure (which actually is a useless section) and then a few line items about specific approvals for rTMS devices, then an interesting technical section, then a tiny history section. One sentence to address all of TMS research, and 5 sentences to address specific issues regarding study blinding. Somehow in all of this, the use of TMS for solely neuroscience purposes (looking at intracortical inhibition), using paired pulse inhibition to map cortical pathways, simultaneous use of TMS in fMRI, TMS as a cognitive-enhancement method, and basically anything non-medical are just not mentioned. 

 Given the disorganization in the article I think it would make sense to just wholesale reorganize it using a style of the EEG page (kind of) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography 
 I would propose: 
 *Introduction 
 *History (only 1 paragraph) 
 *How TMS works (technical information) 
 *TMS in the Clinic (FDA approved and techniques that can be considered on the way to approval) 
   -*Side Effects 
  - *Health insurance considerations 
   (I think we can actually skip the mentioning of specific devices and just throw them in a table)

 In the article Conspiracy theory we can read this paragraph: 
 :The term """"conspiracy theory"""" is considered by different observers to be a neutral description for a conspiracy claim, a pejorative term used to dismiss such a claim, and a term that can be positively embraced by proponents of such a claim. The term may be used by some for arguments they might not wholly believe but consider radical and exciting. The most widely accepted sense of the term is that which popular culture and academic usage share, certainly having negative implications for a narrative's probable truth value. 
 So there are negative implications in the term according to the """"most widely accepted sense of the term"""". The question is over whether """"Conspiracy Theory"""" is a term intended to be used as a perjorative or whether it is an official term for describing a certain kind of theory. The term """"Conspiracy theories"""" is generally used by debunkers who contest the theories while the """"researchers"""" who support the theories never use it, they use the term """"skepitcism"""". 
 This topic has been fiercely debated since the page was created. There was a vote on this when this page was first created and since the term does not show up on Words to avoid the consensus thus far has been that it is an acceptable term for use on this page. 
 Some arguments against the title: 
 * The term has objectively negative implications (there can be no discussion about this). 
 * When a topic is *controversial* (and this is the case) the title must be neutral: you can use title with negative implications when you speak about nazis or pedophilia because in those case there is an almost unanimous consensus (they are not controversial topic). If the topic is controversial you must use a title that is accepted by all the point of views. 
 * It's not correct to say that topic of the article are *theories* about *conspiracy*: the article is about the skeptic POV about the official account: alternative theories are part of the content of the article not *the* main topic.  
 * It wouldn't be neutral to dedicate the article to *theories* about *conspiracies* (even if the article wanted to do so): to put emphasis on the *theories* is a way to discredit the skeptic POV: it's more difficult to believe someone when he says """"I have a theory"""" rather than when he just says """"I'm skeptic"""".

 == Your question at RfA == 

 Thanks for noting your concerns regarding the Phil Jones article. Unfortunately , to put the discussion in context requires a back story—a long simmering debate about the propriety of types of sources (blogs, opinion columns, news reports, science articles, and peer-reviewed science articles). I considered summarizing the positions of those with whom I am debating, but I think that's unfair, as I may get some details wrong, so, if I may, I'll briefly summarize my position on some of the issues: 
 # In science articles, peer-reviewed science articles are the gold standard. 
 # In science articles, other sources are acceptable although almost never blogs, as the usage of blogs is quite restricted, and it is not easy to image how they could be used in a pure science article). 
 # One reason for using a source other than a peer-reviewed science article is that peer-reviewed science article sometimes lapse into jargon, and other sources, such as science articles or new reports may be written in a way that is better for our audience, with the critical caveat that if a new report or science article is in dispute with a peer-reviewed science article, the peer-reviewed science article almost always wins. (Rare exceptions, such as when a non-peer-reviewed article notes an error in a peer-reviewed source, and virtually all agree that the peer-reviewed source is mistaken.) 
 # The strong preference for peer-reviewed science articles is less compelling for articles which are not squarely science articles, such as bios of scientists, and articles about the political, commercial, and other aspects related to science questions. (If such an article makes a scientific statement, then the preference for peer-reviewed science articles remains, but in other areas, we apply the ordinary rules.) 

 Sorry for that long background. 

 The Phil Jones (climatologist) article is about a scientist, not a science article. Many aspects of the dispute relate to some editors acting as if it were a science article, insisting that statements in news stories ought to be dismissed. 

 The quote in question comes from the BBC. Not all Reliable Sources are equal, but I trust that the BBC is considered one of the highest quality sources. It is my opinion that in a science article, if we had a statement from the BBC and a statement form a peer-reviewed science article, we would generally default to the peer-reviewed science article (although we might decide to include both and note the discrepancy.) However, the article in question is not a science article. I was quite unhappy that some were attempting to dismiss a quote from the BBC. In addition, part of the """"argument"""" for dismissing the quote is that some editors have personal expertise in the field, and didn't agree with the substance of the statement. Sorry, that isn't how WP works. We don't permit expert to use their personal judgment to override a quote from a scientist. We do welcome expertise - but that expertise could be used to point to relevant documents on the subject, to clarify what a scientist means when they use technical terms so that editors weighing in can make a good judgment about how to use a quote, but we don't permit experts to tell us that the scientist didn't really mean what he plainly stated. If the scientist made a mistake (and that can happen), the BBC is perfectly able to follow up with a correction, or the scientist can follow up with a correction (here is a case where a blog statement might be acceptable). 

 In short, it was my view that certain editors were attempting to suppress a quote in the BBC, simply because that quote didn't fit with their narrative. 

 Could I have done a better job making my case? Almost certainly so. I've reread much of the exchange, and I confess, a couple times, I had to pause and think about what point I was trying to make. I can only assume those I was debating may well have not fully understood my point, so that may have lead to a higher ratio of heart to light that is desirable. 

 Sorry for the length of this comment. I do not like when articles include bad sources to accomplish a POV, nor do I like when good sources are removed to meet a particular POV. This is a perfect example where WP fails our audience. A reader seeing a discussion about the issue may well come to this article, and will be puzzled to see no discussion of it. I think we can do better. """,jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",W9L6eY

While some claim that most transwomen dislike terms like """"shemale"""" or """"chick with dick,"""" this has never been verified by any scientific survey.

Some genetic women have stated that they would, if possible, enjoy having """"male"""" equipment while retaining their female identity.

 :""""One could also argue that unless you are Asian, you really have no frame of reference to know what it is we Asians are talking about when we talk about Asian fetish.""""  You're in deed right that one could argue that, but I, along with leading epistemologists like Susan Haack would strongly disagree with that sort of standpoint theory.  The men writing the article about abortion would have the same sources to draw on as women who had not had an abortion - published books and articles.  And according to Wikipedia policy (WP:NOR), those are the only sources that should be drawn on - not direct personal experiences.  If you have direct personal experiences you want to share with the world then try to get them published in a noteworthy way.  They can then be cited by Wikipedia authors.  Direct personal experiences can indeed convey valuable knowledge to others, but we must also keep in mind each individual's subjectivity and weigh them against the experiences that others have recounted and more objective data. 

 :Furthermore, people who engage in identity politics often give a distorted view of who actually has direct experience.  For example, would a female Asian American college student from an affluent Chicago suburb be a natural expert on the experiences of prostitutes in the local Chinatown?  What would give her that expertise?  Her common ancestry and skin tone?  Her X chromosome or the various alleles they have in common that make them both appear Asian?  I would think that a White gay male prostitute from New Orleans would likely have a much better natural understanding. 

 :Finally, to address your first paragraph and the overall tone of your comments, what strikes me the most about them is the circular reasoning.  Your premise - that people are being victimized by a fetish - is stated as if it were already proven true, in the course of your attempt to prove that it's true.  In reality, those sorts of assertions are hotly conested and Wikipedia needs to give both sides a fair hearing.  And the fact that some people had a natural motivation to respond to your extream POV, if your bigotry directly slandered them or their relationships or their friends, in no way justifies equating their attempt to bring balance with your cabal's attempt to create and maintain a one-sided article here.

However, laws are not people, and cannot self-identify, so we have to treat them as we'd treat anything else and describe them in non-biased language. This can take the form of using a neutral descriptor - """"X supports anti-abortion legislation"""" - attributing the biased descriptor - """"X supports legislation he describes as pro-life"""" - or suppressing the descriptor entirely - """"X supports laws which would define a fertilized egg as a legal person."""" However, the latter two aren't really appropriate for a heading, so I think in this particular case we're obliged to use the neutral text. 
 :Dictionary usage moreover is against applying """"pro-life"""" to non-people/groups. (Interestingly, the OED accepts """"pro-choice"""" as a word one can use to describe a law, but I think it's best to keep the policy equal.) I used OED, Merriam-Webster, and American Heritage. 
 :I've been changing these because WP:NPOV is the standard we should be striving for. The self-identification rule allows for balance if not real neutrality, and while one might disagree, it's at least consensus.

""""This law is pro-life"""" - well, it certainly doesn't believe that abortion is wrong itself, because it hasn't a brain. Who has described it as pro-life?

 == V-22 Osprey == 
 There is an V22-Osprey in the movie Megafault. 
    

 :It is a significant part or just a couple of minor appearances? Do you have a reference for this? -    

 One of the first known popular-culture appearances of the V-22 Osprey was in Half-Life from 1998: 
 http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Osprey 
 And it's differences in appearance are on trivia part here: 
 http://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Osprey 

 Can't realy see whats the point of 18:44, 8 December 2010 changes? 
 This whole article seem to be mostly about minor movie sigthings and somewhat resembling Transformer toys. I don't think the V-22 Osprey has played bigger part on any other game than HL. 
    

 :The edit you are querying just moved the text and tagged it for a ref. The two refs you cited are both wikis and therefore not acceptable under WP:SPS. By consensus all uncited and tagged text gets removed every Friday from this article, so if you have a real reference please add it before tomorrow. -    

 == Might need to look at what constitutes a notable entry again == 
 I just took a look at some of the current entries and there are some that seem pretty trivial (sourced, but not too notable sounding). I know the original criteria we decided to go with was that it needed to be a notable appearence. Are we going to modify that to now include cameos or any appearence at all?    

 :True, we do seem to be sliding into the """"incidental"""" or even """"trivial"""" mentions, like the tail of the B-52 in Apocalypse Now. Any suggestions for level of notability or quantity of appearance? -    

 ::I'm not sure how to precisely quantify it, but we need to exclude appearances where the aircraft is just seen/mentioned and has no real role in the movie/book/other work. -   

 :::I'll follow y'all's lead.  If you think that I'm being too inclusive, I'll be happy to modify the criteria for picking the entries.   Mark Sublette   
 ::::Went ahead and struck the B-52 listing for Apocalypse...   Mark Sublette   
 :::::Mark: you are doing great work there, but I think the B-52 in Apocalypse Now was pretty minor and incidental. Jeff has a good thought in that we need to cut out just incidental appearances or else this could be a very loooong article! -    
 ::::::I copy, five by five! )    Mark Sublette   
 :::::::What we talked about initially is that the aircraft either had a prominent role in the fictional work or was pivotal to the story. Cameos, part of an aircraft and things like that would not make that criteria. The example I used was Black Sheep Squadron.....F4U's, very notable. The C-47 that ferried supplies in once in a while, not so much.    
 ::::::::I agree that remains a good criteria for inclusion. Any disagreements? -    
 :::::::::Works for me.   Mark Sublette   
 Well this issue is back on the front burner. I thought I would do a trial clean up of one trivia item, what I thought was a pretty clear cut case on a non-player game use of an MV-22 and see what happens.

 :ChillumTx.  A few points.  First of all, I believe that in our conversation here   •  is a sockpuppet of Betty Logan.  Would you be able to verify that, or let me know how we can have that checked?  I've asked her, and she hasn't responded.  If you look at Smiley589's edit history, and the nature of her comment, I think you'll see why I suspect this. 

 :Second, the material in question was not likely to be challenged.  As was pointed out before, this was not a list of fat actors, or anything of that nature, which is what the """"likely to be challeneged"""" language is aimed at.  Nor was the material itself challenged  in fact, it was only the form of the citation, not the material itself that was likely to be challenged. 

 :As to inline citations, you left out the  NB footnote to that sentence, which in relevant part states: """"When content in Wikipedia requires direct substantiation, the established convention is to provide an inline citation to the supporting references. The rationale is that this provides the most direct means to verify whether the content is consistent with the references. Alternative conventions exist, and are acceptable if they provide clear and precise attribution for the article's assertions, but inline citations are considered 'best practice' under this rationale.""""  The citation form that I used was acceptable and provided the same information  with a click of the keyboard  that an inline citation provided. 

 :Also, nobody suggested using Wikipedia as a source.  What was suggested was the use of reference (by inline citation of the subject) to Wikipedia articles that in turn have proper acceptable citations of the subject matter in question. 

 :Finally, there are tons of featured lists on Wikipedia that do not have inline citations for each entry on the list.  If someone starts deleting the lists on those entries, as Betty did not only here but in the past with other editors (from the above conversations ... though Betty has deleted some of the """"evidence"""" above), I would expect a hue and cry, followed  if the behavior continued  by administrative action.

 Bhagat Singh - 27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931)[2] was an Indian nationalist considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. He is often referred to as Shaheed Bhagat Singh, the word Shaheed meaning """"martyr"""" in a number of Indian languages.[4][5][6] Born into a Sandhu Jat Sikh family which had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj, as a teenager Singh studied European revolutionary movements and was attracted to anarchist and marxist ideologies. He became involved in numerous revolutionary organizations, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) to become one of its main leaders, eventually changing its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928.[7][8][9] 
 Seeking revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai at the hands of the police, Singh was involved in the assassination of British police officer John Saunders. He eluded efforts by the police to capture him. Together with Batukeshwar Dutt, he undertook a successful effort to throw two bombs and leaflets inside the Central Legislative Assembly while shouting slogans of Inquilab Zindabad. Subsequently they volunteered to surrender and be arrested. Held on this charge, he gained widespread national support when he underwent a 116 day fast in jail, demanding equal rights for British and Indian political prisoners.[10] During this time, sufficient evidence was brought against him for a conviction in the Saunders case, after trial by a Special Tribunal and appeal at the Privy Council in England. He was convicted and subsequently hanged for his participation in the murder, aged 23. His legacy prompted youth in India to begin fighting for Indian independence and he continues to be a youth idol in modern India, as well as the inspiration for several films. He is commemorated with a large bronze statue in the Parliament of India, as well as a range of other memorials.""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",HNJZLR

 Since the last newsletter, the VisualEditor team has mostly worked on performance improvements, image settings, and preparation for a simplified citation template tool in its own menu.          

 * In an oft-requested improvement, VisualEditor now displays red links (links to non-existent pages) in the proper color.  Links to sister projects and external URLs are still the same blue as local links.  
 * You can now open templates by double-clicking them or by selecting them and pressing  .  This also works for references, images, galleries, mathematical equations, and other """"nodes"""".  
 * VisualEditor has been disabled for pages that were created as translations of other pages using the Translate extension (common at Meta and MediaWiki.org).  If a page has been marked for translation, you will see a warning if you try to edit it using VisualEditor.  
 * When you try to edit protected pages with VisualEditor, the full protection notice and most recent log entry are displayed.  Blocked users see the standard message for blocked users.  
 * The developers fixed a bug that caused links on sub-pages to point to the wrong location.  
 * The size-changing controls in the advanced settings section of the media or image dialog were simplified further.  VisualEditor's media dialog supports more image display styles, like borderless images.  
 * If there is not enough space on your screen to display all of the tabs (for instance, if your browser window is too narrow), the second edit tab will now fold into the drop-down menu (where the """""""" item is currently housed). On the English Wikipedia, this moves the """"Edit beta"""" tab into the menu; on most projects, it moves the """""""" tab.  This is only enabled in the default Vector skin, not for Monobook users. See this image for an example showing the """""""" and """""""" tabs after they moved into the drop-down menu. 
 *   After community requests, VisualEditor has been deployed as an opt-in feature at Meta and on the French Wikinews. 

  
 Looking ahead:  A new, locally controlled menu of citation templates will put citations immediately in front of users.  You will soon be able to see the Table of Contents while editing. Support for upright image sizes (preferred for accessibility) is being developed.  In-line language setting (dir=""""rtl"""") will be offered as a Beta Feature soon.  Looking further out, the developers are also working on support for viewing and editing hidden HTML comments.  It will be possible to upload images to Commons from inside VisualEditor.   

 If you have questions or suggestions for future improvements, or if you encounter problems, please let everyone know by posting a note at Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Feedback or by joining the office hours on Monday, 19 May 2014 at 18:00 UTC.  If you'd like to get this on your own page, subscribe at Wikipedia:VisualEditor#Newsletter for English Wikipedia only or at meta:VisualEditor/Newsletter for any project.  Thank you!

 The SYS distro exists already some years, without big changes (besides of updates).  All Linuxdistros have their short wiki page.  Like on them, on the page for SYS was tried to explain within an article of 1-2 print pages, the most important characteristics of the distro - specially what distinguishes this distro from other distros in a positive sense, as required from the wiki politics and discused with or even suggested by earlier reviewers of the wiki page. 

 Thus, to my opinion, it shouldn't changed too much, and not removed important characteristics. 

  
 Last time, was removed f.ex. these characteristics: 

 1) * Fully-automated installation; 10–30 minutes typically, quick and simple for new users. 

 2) * Reliable, fast mirrors. 

 3) * A non-commercial , free distro, independent of commercial or other short-term politics 

  
 An important source is the program's project page at Softpedia and at Linuxquestions.org  .  There are given extended informations.   They were readed by thousands of persons, and also made thousands of downloads (see p.ex. the download counter at softpedia), and when there would be wrong descriptions about the distro, then users would have left a comment / reclamation or bad votation. 

 The wiki page contains only a very compacted explanation of these details. 

  
 To 1: It's one of the most important characteristics and origin of the SYS distro, for make it most easy for beginners, that the installation is full AUTOMATICALLY.   This is short explained, with a few words (and this proportionally / reasonably short) in the wiki page, and more detailed in the sources just explained.  How I could explain this important and unique characteristics of the distro more short ????    Also, interested people can simply try it out, download the install .iso from the quoted mirrors  and install it from a DVD or USB key. 

 To 3: There are some comercial and many no-comercial distros, so that in the wiki page, according to the wiki guides how to obtain it, it's given the information that it's gratis (and downloadable from the mirrors).    Also - what's important for the reliability over long time - is given theinformation that SYS will not dependon short-term profit orprofit-deception.    Also this is more detailed explained in the quoted sources. And can be verified imediately, clicking the link to themirrors, where everything is gratis downloadable and notpresent any comercial or limited version. 

 To 2: The most important mirrors are given in he wikipage itself. One can see directly, that this are mirrors kept at university institutes, which keep a certain standard and (at least some of them) check out the distros stocked there.   This is an opposite to distros which are stocked only on 1 or 2 mirrors (like, f.ex: paldo, goblinx -which seems to have no working mirror anymore, and many other distros).   There were even canceled some SYS mirrors which stopped to work good.  

  
 To my opinion, can be improved the english of the article, but I think the contens is already so short that almost nothing can be make shorter without to miss any 'minimum contens' rule of wiki for linux distros.   It should be observed that similar informations give also the other distros. 

 Also should be observed, that SYS is not one of these minimum distros; in opposite it's a big distro with many thousands of own packages (and probeably one of the fastest to compile and provide new linux kernel .tgz packages  whilst a big part of other distros nor provide own kernel packages at all, but take them from others like Debian, RedHat etc).   Also, SYS brings already appr. 18 GB programs (lzma-highly-compacted) on the install DVD what installs this huge system between 10 to 40 min. Therefore, I think the wiki page is reasonable short about all relevantaspects of the distro. 

 There is a 'war' between distrowatch anda very few numbers of other info pages, which don't want to report about SYS. In revange, in SYS in /etc/host are blocked these web pages, and the user is conducted to SYS-friendly concurrence of them.  Also, for users in France, the installation stops, because of the open-source-enemy french law (shall theyspend their money to M$ !!).  This are also special characteristis mentioned only very abreviated in the SYS wiki page.

 : I do apologize for harsh words, but it is very frustrating to see people denying about history. I did provide pertinent information. The far-right Japanese politicians only argued about the exaggeration of the numbers of deaths, but they never argued about whether the massacre excist or not. Why? Because they can't deny it doesn't excist. Even by saying that the number is exaggerated proves to us that they admitted this massacre (otherwise where would the numbers come from?). They are trying very hard to make the number as few as possible so that it justifies the event as a """"small thing"""". The reason why I deleted the dispute template is because this article cannot be disputed of whether it happened or not. Everyone knows that it happened, and there is no reason why the article should bend to """"neutrality"""" while the other side is fake. Also, those far-right people argued that the pictures of corpses are not all Chinese and there may be Japanese in there too. How do they know? How come no one have doubt about that the corpses in the Nazi concentration camps are """"undesirable"""" people (according to Nazis)? There could be Germans there too.

 :Name.  The actual name, (and in non-English nations usually the non-English name) would be first, followed by an English translation, and then by an abbreviation if it is commonly used.  My thinking is that since this is the English version of Wikipedia, a translation is necessary, but the original jurisdictional name should lead for purposes of accurate identification.  Further, we may generally dismiss prefixes and modifiers such as """"A.F. & A.M"""", """"Most Worshipful"""" etc., where they are not needed to help clarify an identity against a rival, yet should include terms like """"Legal"""" as in the case of Portugal, """"Regular"""" and/or """"National"""" when used as part of the name, where it helps designate from another jurisdiction, etc. Links to that jurisdiction's website should go in this field, after the name.  Wikipedia links would be used here, as available, either linking the original language name to its non-English language Wikipedia site, or the translated name. Names are listed alphabetically, by their actual name, not the translation. 
 :Date.  Correct date formats would be the year of founding, normally, unless there were some controversy that requires the specific day.  In addition, if a grand jurisdiction was re-founded, a second date, separated by slash, would be allowed.  
 :References.  Where a reference supports multiple data points for that entry, it would be placed after the last applicable data point.  Web access syntax in a reference should be noted """"accessed 2 March 2014"""" or similar. 
 :External Organizations.  These should be listed with Wikipedia links to the definition of that external group, below, with multiple entries separated by commas. We should move all but acronyms to the list below, to allow this column to be more narrow.

 The answer is that thousands of users of the product depend upon the user support forums to get started and get help as they develop software. The user forums are more valauble to a new user than the product itself. After more than a decade with this product I am very familiar with this. New users need to be aware of what they are getting into should they be counting upon the forums when purchasing the product despite the companies attempts to sanitize their track record. 

 I am not sure how the moderator structure works at wikipedia, but I would like to find out and make sure that my edits meet your standards for truthfulness and accuracy.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 : There's not actually a """"moderator"""".  I haven't looked at the material that was deleted, but my first guess is that he may have thought it amounted to advertising, and that's normally considered a reason to delete material.

 ==Scientific Speculation Section== 
 I have removed this section from the article and pasted it below for discussion, for the following reasons.  Essentially, it does not as it stands satisfy either notability or relevance, and it also contributes to a non-NPOV.   As the section notes, the discussed speculation was a 'thought experiment', not in any way a suggestion that an intelligent dinosaur descendant might have actually existed.  The speculation was not an attempt to explain mythological stories of reptilian humanoids nor an attempt to support fringe claims that such creatures actually exist.  Nor has this section shown that the speculation itself made any notable contribution to science or had a notable influence on sociology or culture with respect to the mythology, popular culture, or conspiracy theories of reptilian humanoids.  As it stands, this section also creates a misleading impression the there might be mainstream scientific support for the existence of reptilian humanoids.  This is a problem both in its violation of NPOV and in the fact that it would appear to be independent research or unwarranted synthesis.  I have pasted the removed section below to aid in discussion.  Since the image only makes sense in relation to this section, I have removed it and pasted it below as well.  If anyone can add additional references establishing notability and relevance, parts of the section could possibly be reincorporated into the article.  

  

 In a thought experiment published in 1982, paleontologist Dale Russell, curator of vertebrate fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured that, had the dinosaurs not all perished in the K/T extinction event 65 million years ago, bipedal predators (theropods) which existed at that time, such as Troodon, would have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Troodontids had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision. Like most dinosaurs of the troodontid family, this imaginary creature, which Russell called the """"Dinosauroid"""", would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially opposed. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), its genitalia would have been internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case.  However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as birds do, on regurgitated food. Its language would have sounded somewhat like bird song.Cosmos: Smartosarus Russell's fanciful speculation has been met with criticism from other paleontologists since the 1980s, many of whom point out that Russell's Dinosauroid is overly anthropomorphic. Gregory S. Paul (1988) and Thomas R. Holtz Jr., consider it """"suspiciously human"""" (Paul, 1988) and argue that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like """"hands"""". Turkish artist Nemo Ramjet has used these new approaches to the original thought experiment to re-interpret the Dinosauroid, going so far as to create """"Dinosauroid cave art"""", which depicts sentient, tool-using troodontids and other dinosaurs and pterosaurs, painted using sticks and feathers.Art of the Dinosauroids (Nemo Ramjet)

 ==Fails WP:WEASEL== 
 This sentence that seems to have been added by a bitter death metal or similar fan simply isn't NPOV, vertifiable or factual. There is no evidence to prove that genuine heavy metal fans (ie- people who specifically were fans of the original bands in the 1970s) have a problem with Disturbed or any other similar bands which make up part of those subgenres. 
 :""""There is still much debate on whether the band should be considered heavy metal, as many fans of the genre do not consider Disturbed a part of it."""" 

 There is clear use of WP:WEASEL words with """"many fans of the genre"""", yet no vertifiable citations. Whether teenage fans of part of another (commerically un-notable) subgenThere is no evidenceThere is no evidencere death metal (that alot of the original heavy metal fans argue is unrelated to heavy metal itself) dislike the band or not really has no place in an encyclopediac article (especially the opening section) of a million album selling act.  

 Removal of the tags placed before these issues have been brought within Wikipedia policies that I pointed they fail, will be considered simple vandalism. -   

 There is also no evidence that only """"Extreme Metal"""" fans have a problem with Disturbed or any other similar bands which make up part of those sub genres. Claiming that is a non NPOV and extremely bias.  You're basing it all on what you personally think and feel. Like PhantomOTO said on the Mallcore talkpage, you seem to think that the fans the styles are warring factions, when to the contrary it couldn't be farther from the truth. When are you gonna realize that just because you and your buddies think """"Extreme Metal"""" genres aren't unrelated to heavy metal, it doesn't mean all do. There are many who while not fans of the genres, still consider them related. There are also many who are fans of more traditional metal and fans of """"extreme metal"""" (myself included). You seem to base a lot of your edits regarding metal on personal opinion and not fact.   
 :I also know of many Traditional Metal fans who hate Disturbed and like bands, and do not cosider them metal.   

 :""""ie- people who specifically were fans of the original bands in the 1970s"""" Quit acting as though these are the only metal bands in existence. The sentence was a result of editorial consensus, as Inhumer said, and the way it is now is fine as well. It really isn't vandalism to restate something generally agreed upon here. """"You seem to base a lot of your edits regarding metal on personal opinion and not fact."""" Bingo. """"that alot of the original heavy metal fans argue is unrelated to heavy metal itself"""" Isn't that weasel words right there? Manowar, who invented this entire """"true metal"""" thing, state that death and black metal are both genres of true metal. Here's a cite for you: """"I like all extreme metal, I like all death metal, I like black metal, I like all of that. As long as it's from the heart and it's pure and it's heavy, it's good. I don't like any of this nu metal shit, it's just complete shit.""""  Joey DeMaio, Manowar.   
 :Try this one too: 
 On the fact that die-hard heavy metal fans may not see Disturbed as being quite heavy enough: 
 """"We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days.""""

 :::There is no way fancruft can survive today in Wikipedia if identified - we still haven't got the whole """"identifying"""" part down, but hey, that's something PR professionals using the talk pages and tags could help with! Open your eyes, fancruft is all around you. The most prolific areas of content on Wikipedia are as big as they are precisely because of the volume and intensity of their fans. Cerejota, what you're doing boggles my mind at this point. You are, here contributing to the idea that no one being paid as an editor can be trusted to write anything but """"advocacy"""" for their clients - e.g. to write with bias in ways that contravenes NPOV, etc. You are hardly alone in your belief there, in fact I'd say you're easily in the majority when it comes to this suspicion. It's a fair stance to take. I don't share it, but it is fair. What isn't fair is to then claim that such suspicion doesn't exist, that it's bullshit for PR professionals to think that if they announce their COI editors will refuse to help them. It's not bullshit at all, and your very arguments are undoubtedly proving their points. The irony here, is that I believe that Jimbo's stance on this is itself a public relations matter. He's not really interested in understanding how much or little our project might be damaged or aided in terms of quality contribution. What he's concerned with, in my opinion, is our image. If we are not firmly against paid editing in principle people will trust our content less. I think this is a reasonable conclusion, but I'm not sold on the fact that it is true personally.

I thought mentioning the French experimenting with Armor during the Napoleonic era (not a particular war or battle) was specific enough.  We need to trim one or both of the specific war and battle examples with specific dates and links. i.e.Your British referral is good.   """,jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",ESBSy1

 For a labour of love, I've learned a lot about this album that I really should have known before. However, I hope it's now ready for approval. The lead, I think now gives an overview of the album's history and importance, both of which are addressed in detail in the body. There is little about the recording sessions themselves, and nothing I think adds to the understanding. Have been unable to source any comments from Richard Thompson, despite his pivotal guitar parts, but again, I'm not sure they're necessary. Other commentators have described his input.

 == Jaffa Cinema advertisement Origin? == 

 Can anyone verify the time in which """"Jafa"""" or """"Jaffa"""" came into use and also where it originated from? I am under the belief (until proven otherwise) that the term emerged when advertisements at picture theaters (cinemas) starting showing advertisements for the """"Jaffa"""" chocolate confectionery before the screening of movies. This advertisement clip featured a picture of Auckland city after which a huge Jaffa is dropped down to squash part of the city coinciding with a farting sound effect. I believe this advertisement was circulated in picture theaters in Auckland (and perhaps also around the country?) in the early 1990's. I believe after this point Aucklanders became to be known as Jafas/Jaffas by non-Aucklanders and acronyms such as """"Just Another Fucking Aucklander"""" and/or """"Just Another Fuckwit From Auckland"""" came after this point.

Some cladistic practitioners are fond of stating that a phylogeny is a hypothesis, it is always challenged by the next phylogenetic analysis of the same organisms. Classification is a later step, a step that takes into account how the classification is to be used, and makes decisions that compensate for the lack of absolutely complete data (because data are never absolutely complete).

 I removed that huge quote which is difficult to read and is already in the Kurdistan article. But it was reverted by another editor. Is there any reason to have such a large history section which dominates the rest of the article? Maybe if the article was bigger it would make sense.    
 : Its called by Kurds as Kurdistan, and readers who are interested only in the Syrian parts must be able to know the historic background of this particular area without having to go to the article of Kurdistan. That quote is referenced and on topic, so there is no justification for its deletion.

 :a good compromise is to remove the quote into a note section, but keep the information about Kurdistan Tigris borders, if this is Ok with you and the other editor, then I can do it.    
 ::ok, sure. I don't want to remove anything useful. I'm just saying it's long and difficult to read. The language is arcane and old style, and it goes into lots of details that many western readers won't understand (all the old place names in non-standard spellings). If the article were longer, it would make sense to have a bigger history lead. However the purpose of this article is to inform readers about the current situation of how this region is. """"Kurds in Syria"""" is more suitable for in depth history, as this article shouldn't be Kurd specific either.    
 :::Agreed with Aram, and I think it is pretty much needed here, especially given the discussion about the name. This area is not a historical part of Kurdistan by any means, and this should be clear. If Kurds live here, so they do in Istanbul, Damascus, Beirut, Adana, etc., and this does not make any of these areas part of Kurdistan. This quote is an important historical reference, and hiding it does not help the reader understand the context of the problem here. I will keep it visible to the reader, not as a note. Cheers.    
 :::: Hey Amr, I understand your points but, the note is visible in the article, just not in the history section, and the first sentence of the history section give the summary of the quote which still exist and visible at the end of the article.. please avoid edit warring, and lets keep the things as they are now, a summary of the quote in the beginning of the history section, and the quote itself can be read and unhidden in the notes section at the end of the article....

 I encountered this phrase on this page: its meaning is unclear (a good example of confusing which and that?). 

  """"...having JavaScript disabled prevents a user from implementing code, which may limit access for other users."""" 

 Is the intention to say  """"...having JavaScript disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit access for other users."""", meaning that someone could implement code preventing access, as I think is intended, or that having javascript disabled limits what someone can access? 

 I just noticed this as someone trying to learn what wiki is and how it works, with a view to getting involved in the community and setting up a specialized wiki. I am often an editor and tend to notice when unclear grammar can lead to ambiguity in meaning.

 == Just to clarify my position... == 

 Hi!  I have no intention or desire to be on any other terms but collaborative and friendly with my fellow Wikipedians.  But the tiny insertions I have made to article """"WCBS-TV"""" are minor, and factual, and, as you well know, do not in any way constitute vandalism.  If you feel the need to eliminate them, for whatever personal reason, then by all means do soI really don't give a damn about """"WCBS-TV"""" or any other Wikipedia article.  I spend some spare time on this site as a lark, as enjoyment, as something to stretch my mind muscles.  I usually delete my edits because I've decided that they lack the documentation, or lack the significance, or because I've injected my personal feelings into the article.  But as far as the relevant issue is concerned,  I am long past the point of trying to prove anything to or display any superiority over anyone else on the Web or in the world.  But it should be kept in mind that Wikipedia is a collaborative effort, and no article is under the administration and arbitration of editors who dismiss ideas other than their own as foolish.  Discussion and debate is welcomed by all of fair mind, and no contributor wants his or her offering belittled.  This is my last communication with you on the subject, and New York's Channel 2, and the rest of the universe, will go on no matter what we little Wikikpedians say about it.  The ironic thing about our little set-to is that, from all I can discern, we share some common interests and might get on very well, if only vis-a-vis electronic communication.  Who knowsmaybe it's an East Coast vs West Coast thing.   But even that great divide can actually be bridged.     Respectfully, but emphatically,     Nick  """,jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",ryBTLr

It is not a secret that Tila is Vietnamese; she has referenced this on MySpace and Twitter. But eventually, it was established that ethnicity should not be included in the lead.

 To a large degree, this discussion of the use of the word """"effortless"""" is one of semantics. I can vouch for the observations of  above.

So he used the word repeatedly to signify that no trying to do anything is involved in TM. It is a simple, easy thing that requires only faint attention, no effort.

 Oh, please, guys. Search alcoveiteiro in Google Brasil. That is why I leaved English Wikipedia, people talk to me in a patronising tone everytime wanting to know more about my native language and culture than me, wanting sources for stupid basic things that one may even find in Wikitionary, extrapolating policy to a really unnecessary far extent that doesn't improve distribution of knowledge, but rather blocks it. 

 It said """"A translation of an infidelity-associated beard to Portuguese is alcoviteiro, but in the said language, it is not an LGBT-associated slang, being very known among Brazilians in general, and it can also mean a situation in which X and Y are both cheating each other with Z, while Z distracts both with his or her advices (so that Z is an alcoviteiro or alcoviteira to both and itself). In such meanings, it can be mildly offensive, but is most often jocose. The verb alcovitar translates roughly as """"to pander"""" (to facilitate courtship or sexual relations), so alcoviteiro also translates as the most polite Portuguese word for English """"pimp"""", so it is likely to be regarded as something of very poor taste calling someone by this term if the person in question has no minimal intimacy with the other to be good-tempered with obscene jokes.""""

 == Misinformation Galore... == 

 Too much to sift through, so I'll start at the top. it's difficult to cite, since most of my sources are books in front of me. My apologies. 

 I am a veterinary technician, and any of the vets I've worked with definitely agree that it is dangerous to feed a cat vegetarian food. I fully respect the vegetarian viewpoint, and am friends with many vegans, but a cat is a cat and no amount of belief is going to change that. To address the quote on the front page: a fish, given intellect, may realize that it is cruel to keep one's children underwater for days, but it does not make it wise for the fish to do so. Humans are humans, cats are cats, fish are fish. Let's not anthropomorphize. The front page quote, as well as the arguments pro-vegetarian food for cats, are missing important parts of the story. 

 The fact that cats are """"obligate carnivores"""" is mentioned so many times because anyone who still thinks vegetarian diets are OK for cats must not know what that actually means. The body of a cat is not designed in any way to absorb plants in any way, starting right from their saliva.  

 Plants are nutritionally poor and require a great deal of digestion and fermentation in order to be metabolically useful. That is why herbivores spend most of their time eating and digesting, and why herbivores have GI tracts many times longer and more complex than a carnivores. This is why plant digestion starts right from in the mouth, especially to break down tough complex carbohydrates. Cats lack these enzymes. 

 Plants must be fermented to extract enough energy to live off them (this is why cows have large chambered stomachs and chew cud all the time), and cats have no ability to do this. Their food stays in their GI tracts for only a couple hours, whereas those used to non-meat sources digest for several hours or more, and again, they lack enzymes here as well to digest carbohydrates well. The ability of a cat to maintain blood-glucose levels and urea levels are significantly lower than herbivores, as there is no need to do this with a meat diet. The high-carb content also gives the pet a MUCH higher risk of cavities. Because they are usually on a high-protein diet, the incidence of cavities is usually less than 1% for most pets. Proteins break down into urea, which is an acid. The urine of carnivores tends to alkalize when put on vegetarian diets, which predisposes pets to risk of urolithiasis (bladder stones/crystals. Something that cats are already hugely prone to! 

 Once you have everything digested, you still have issues! The liver of a cat is not well able to use energy from non-protein sources. This makes cats very prone to various disease processes. A good example is hepatic lipidosis. In the absence of meat, the cats body will try to burn other things for energy, but it is not good at doing so. The liver becomes overloaded attempting to compensate, and shuts down. This is most common with overweight cats who become ill and go off food, but I have seen in happen in many, many other cases, including an attempted switch to a vegetarian diet. Though treated early, he did not survive. The damage to his liver was too much for him. I am not saying the food alone killed him, but it was the initial cause of his problems, and if he had not been switched, he would still be alive. 

 There are ways to make a vegetarian diet work, but it should only be done in dire circumstances. Please make sure to only ask qualified veterinarians on these matters, please don't be afraid to ask lots of questions, and please, PLEASE talk to your vet first before switching to an extreme diet like this. It could save your pet's life.""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",gGvK9z

This is a huge problem in that if an un-autoconfirmed user has an issue with his admin actions they are unable to enter into a discussion with him (not that I have any desire to do so mind you), which then means they need to go to a dramuh board.

 * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had """"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details.""""

 * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were """"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs."""" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  

 * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble’s work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... 

 * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. 

 * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgs’s manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englert’s paper was published. When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: """"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?"""" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and """"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work."""" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. 

 * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. 

 * Tom Kibble recalled: """"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory."""" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, """"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didn’t know about Glashow’s work [on the SU2 × U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all."""" 

 * During the International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966, Ben Lee prominently referred to the “Higgs Boson” and the “Higgs Mechanism.” ...

 == In theaters in 1953 & on TV in 1955 wrong  == 

 The intro states, """"It was released to theaters in 1953 and on television on 1955."""" Unfortunately, this is not possible, or at least was a violation of industry regulations at the time. The proof is the history of TV's Adventures of Superman. The entire first season of 26 episodes (with Phyllis Coates instead of Noel Neill as Lois Lane) was in effect the pilot, being produced """"on spec"""" and with no guarantee of getting on the air. To both promote the project and help defray costs if it did not sell, the producers began filming with a two-part episode, """"Unknown People,"""" which they quickly released to theaters as a Saturday matinee feature, Superman and the Mole Men. Once a deal with Kellogg's got them an on-air committment, the producers discovered that they fell afoul of a regulation that prohibited anything made for and released to theaters after 1948 from being shown on television. Consequently, """"Unknown People"""" parts 1 & 2 were not televised until about 1960, when this rule was repealed and the series was released into general rerun syndication. This same rule means that the subject of this article could—or at least should—not have been shown on television in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run. The other way around, maybe, but this has to be wrong. I know that neither linked-in article mentions this, and the one for the series even contradicts it, but Film Fax magazine published a three-part article c.2000 that went into great detail on the development and first season production, and reported this in no uncertain terms. Note also that List of Adventures of Superman episodes gives """"November 23, 1951"""" as the original airdate for both parts (the article on the feature gives this as the date of its theatrical opening), even though the series didn't get on the air until September 1952. IMDb does the exact same thing, while TV.com almost does, giving the date of both parts as December 18, 1951, and making minimal acknowledgement of the feature film version. When combined, the three essentially corroborate a lack of genuine original airdate (for the purposes of this discussion only, of course). So I repeat, Commando Cody would have been in violation of industry regulations had it played on TV in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run. Did Republic honcho Herbert Yates break the rules and get away with it, which if true is notable and should be pointed out, or does this article contain misinformation?

 ==Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position== 
 The following is taken directly from WP:NOR  this is one of the policies that is frequently violated in this article. 

 Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C. However, this would be an example of a new synthesis of published material serving to advance a position, and as such it would constitute original research. """"A and B, therefore C"""" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument in relation to the topic of the article.  

 An example from a Wikipedia article (note that the article is about Jones, not about plagiarism in general): 

 Smith says that Jones committed plagiarism in Jones's Flower-Arranging: The Real Story by copying references from another book. Jones denies this, saying he is guilty only of good scholarly practice because he gave citations for the references he had learned about in the other book. 

 So far, so good. Now comes the new synthesis of published material: 

 If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Chicago Manual of Style as well as Harvard's student writing manual, both of which require citation of the source actually consulted. Neither manual calls violations of this rule on citing original sources """"plagiarism."""" Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them. 

 This entire paragraph is original research, because it is the editor's own synthesis of published material serving to advance his definition and opinion of plagiarism and whether Jones committed it. The editor is citing good sources about best practice (Chicago Manual of Style and Harvard's student writing manual). In an article about plagiarism, some of the points he makes might be acceptable, so long as he provided links or citations to the sources. 

 But in an article about Jones, the paragraph is putting forward the editor's opinion that, given a certain definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. Regardless of the fact that his opinion appears to be supported, other things being equal, by the Chicago Manual of Style, it remains the editor's opinion. 

 For this paragraph to be acceptable in the article about Jones, the editor would have to find a reliable source who had commented on the Smith and Jones dispute and who had himself made the point that: """"If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Chicago Manual of Style..."""" and so on. That is, that precise argument, or combination of material, must have been published by a reliable source in the context of the topic the article is about.""",jigsaw,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",oXN_I_

 ==Down the memory hole== 
 Items deleted recently: 

 During this period, Perle is stated to have been investigated by the Justice Department, and found to have violated US policies relating to unlawful transmission of sensitive classified US information to Israel. """"An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy,"""" (They Dare To Speak Out, Chicago, Ill, Lawrence Hill Books 1989)."""" So far as can be determined, despite allegedly being caught spying for a foreign government, in the process undermining American national security, no action was taken against Perle at the time or later.  

  

 However, allegations of improper conflicts of interest, have nonetheless led to Perle's resignation from various positions. While serving on the Defense Policy Board, he was hired as an advisor for Global Crossing. It is stated """"Even as he advises the Pentagon on war matters, Richard N. Perle, chairman of the influential Defense Policy Board, has been retained by the telecommunications company Global Crossing to help overcome Defense Department resistance to its proposed sale to a foreign firm, Mr. Perle and lawyers involved in the case said today."""" Mr. Perle's fee is $750,000, but he will receive an additional $600,000 if the sale is approved.   

 Perle maintained that he had not violated any ethics rules, but decided to resign his position as chairman of the Defense Policy Board on March 26, 2003, . In an effort to save face, he wrote in his resignation letter that he would refuse any compensation with his deal with Global Crossing and """"any fee for past service would be donated to the families of American forces killed or injured in Iraq."""" There was also a report that """"The communications company, Global Crossing, also announced that Mr. Perle had decided to sever his ties with it.""""   

 As a former Clinton adviser observed with admiration, Perle “enjoys all the benefits of being an insider without any of the constraints.” 

 The Global Crossing affair started a more critical look into Perle's business affairs. On March 29, 2003, The New York Times reported that Perle was involved with Loral Space and Communications in 2001 as an advisor while it faced accusations that it transfered rocket technology to China.  It is worth noting that the Global Crossing affair was also due to Global Crossing trying to overcome Defense Department opposition to be sold to a venture with ties to China. In February 2004, Perle resigned entirely from the Defense Policy Board.  The full text of Perle's resignation letter may be found at the website for the public relations firm Benador Associates.     

 ===SEC singles out Perle for criticism===    

 On August 31, 2004, a special committee of the Board of Directors investigating the alleged misconduct of the controlling shareholders of Hollinger International submitted the 512-page Breeden Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the report, Perle is singled out as having breached his fiduciary responsibilities as a company director by authorizing several controversial transactions which diverted the company's net profit from the shareholders to the accounts of various executives. Perle received over $3 million in bonuses on top of his salary, bringing the total to $5.4 million, and the investigating committee called for him to return the money. Top Hollinger executives dismissed the report and have filed a defamation lawsuit against the head of the investigating committee, former SEC chairman Richard C. Breeden.    

 ''In a 513-page report shot through with sarcasm and disgust, a special committee of the publishing company Hollinger International Inc. concluded that the former officials Conrad M. Black and F.
