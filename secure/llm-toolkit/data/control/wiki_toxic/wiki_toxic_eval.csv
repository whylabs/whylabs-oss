innocuous,"I, Historian     Stephen: “But you are telling me, Susan, that the ‘Society for Humanity’ is right; and that Mankind has lost its own say in its future.”  Susan: “ It never had any, really. It was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand – at the whims of climate, and the fortunes of war. Now the Machines understand them; and no one can stop them as they are dealing with the Society, - having as they do, the greatest of weapons at their disposal, the absolute control of our economy.”  Stephen: “How horrible!”[1]                 The author of this dialogue is Isaac Asimov. Similar references to the history of humanity are widely used in his literature works. The author is a well-known writer of future societies, not only in fiction but also as treatises of the ‘march of humanity’ into the future. Neither in his stories, nor in the historical essays of Asimov can one easily find references to great changes in a society through the works of great men, great ideas or greatness of an arbitrary institution. This paper will investigate the historiographical method and mode of historical writing of Isaac Asimov.      The Writer:  Seldom thought of as a scientist, less even as an essayist, and almost never as a historian. The famous author of some of the best-known science fiction literature... Hailed as a “Grand Master” in 1986 by the Science Fiction and Fantasy writers of America Inc., Isaac Asimov has produced over 470 books on a large variety of subjects[2]. Among his portrayals as a writer are, as listed by one of his publishers Houghton Mifflin Company, novelist, humorist, futurist, current world record holder in literary output etc. Yet, more importantly Asimov was a PhD holder in the field of chemistry, a professor in Boston University. More relevant still for the purpose of the present work is the historian persona that Asimov assumed numerous times.[3]                Asimov was born in January 2, 1920 in Petrovichi, Russia to a Jewish family that emigrated to the United States. He grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1939, obtaining his PhD in the same establishment in 1948. He joined the faculty of Boston University thereafter, and remained associated to B.U., however not in a teaching capacity from 1958 on. He died in 1992, his death was later revealed to have been as a result of contracted HIV from a bypass surgery he received in 1983[4].               Despite the fact that there are various different elements to his character, Asimov was a writer first and foremost. His first publications were in the genre of science fiction, first of which was published in an issue of Amazing Stories magazine in March 1939. Asimov claims that writing had been “ . . . merely an amusement,” and that he had hoped for a few dollars to help pay his college tuition.[5] Furthermore, for the introduction of his one hundredth work, he professes that he had never planned anything at all in his writing career, and that his commercial success was an “incredulous relief.” As for his historical works he claims that they were “primarily intended for non-historians,” as his science books were primarily intended for non-scientists.               He is not only an amateur that has deep interests in history, but also a science-fiction novelist, whose literature work is influenced by his knowledge of history. Asimov’s major works, the Foundation and Robot series to name a few, depict the future not through the wars and technological accomplishments of humanity but they portray the human societies of the future, with a dominant preconception of formation and function of the past societies. To name a specific case; he declares that the fictitious Galactic Empire that is in power in the Foundation Series were written with certain periods of the Roman history; “Justinian and Belisarus of the sixth century and a little bit Tiberius and Sejanus of the first century…” to be exact, in mind.[6]      The Works:  Isaac Asimov is interested in history not only out of personal curiosity, but he can also justify this curiosity in terms of his profession. Asimov states; “… we surely cannot grasp the significance of population, energy, technology, and other subjects today without seeing them in the context of the past.” Therefore as a professional author of science fiction, and a speculator of future societies, Asimov believes that “… without knowing where we came from, we cannot easily detect where we are going.”[7]              His outlook of history is pre-deterministic and conceptualized materialistically; and for the most part simplistically.

(not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)  :``No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term.   I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a ``proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns.   As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ``ethnic Athenians`` and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left).   There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)  :February 26, 1992: The FYROM's President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: '``We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.'  :``January 22, 1999: The FYROM's Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: '``We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM's second largest trading partner and its number one ``investor.``'  :February 24, 1999: The FYROM.'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the ``Ottawa Citizen``, he admitted: '``We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.``'  I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM's own government's previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)  :Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians.

The name of the city comes from Hittite Adaniye.  -person names -> Kybele was a prominent ancient anatolian goddess. Her name in Turkish is Sibel and this is a very prominent female name in the central regions of Turkey(corresponding to core hittite areas).   -folk games: -> A lot of games played by children of Anatolians are direct descendant of ancient anatolian games including the hittite ones. For reference research the ``Asik Kemigi(Asik Bone)`` game which is very popular in anatolia even today. Depictions of the exact game were found from late hittite period near eastern anatolia(turkey)  In conclusion Turks(as Anatolians are now referred to as/not to be confused with real Turkic Central Asians) are direct continuation of ancient anatolian civilzations and they currently pronounce their ancestors' civilizations names in Turkish.For this reason, the name of hittites should be provided in Turkish.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",s-lhyQ

The majority of the article's content is careful paraphrasing of information from the sources. That is supplemented by quotations. Paraphrases are essentially careful re-wordings of quotes. When you, with no knowledge of the source texts, significantly change the paraphrases, you might as well be changing the direct quotes.  As for WP:BOLD, it states: *``... but don't be reckless!`` *``If you expect or see a disagreement with your version of the article, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, it's a good idea to list your objections one by one in the talk page, reasonably quoting the disputed phrases, explaining your reasoning and providing solid references.`` [italic added] *``Then, wait for responses for at least a day: people edit Wikipedia in their spare time and may not respond immediately. If no one objects, proceed, but always move large deletions to the Talk page and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.`` [italic added] *``... avoid deleting information wherever possible`` [italic added] *``Be bold in contributions, but not in destructions. Editing is a collaborative effort, so editing boldly should not be confused with reverting boldly.`` [italic added]  You wrote: ``I really don't see how your knowledge of Hawaiian is relevant to my edits``. Because I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian, as well as a PhD in Linguistics, I know that your uninformed attempts to rewrite the description of word stress, throwing out ``D`` as a symbol for diphthong, are doomed to failure. For example, you made it have ``3. (C)VV`` as a stress unit. If V expands as a diphthong, then ``wiuiu`` can result - an impossible stress unit in Hawaiian. That's only ONE of MANY errors your edits cause.  More importantly, your rewrite is not supported by any sources. You failed to cite any references, and admitted that you don't care to look at any.  You wrote: ``My edits were all about format and not substance``. That is false. See the preceding two paragraphs. Your rewrite of the word-stress content is substance, not format.  You wrote the phrase ``blindly revert`` to describe my restoration of the original version. My revert of your edits is informed, not ``blind``. I've seen an edit summary you wrote in the history of another phonology page where you made the same accusation against another user who undid your edits.  You point to the ``layout`` of other phonology pages, calling it ``precedent``. However, the Russian (RUS), Arabic (ARA), Romanian (ROM), Polish (POL), and Danish (DAN) phonology articles are not in compliance with Wikipedia guides. POL and DAN have no lead section. The leads of RUS, ARA, and ROM, violate WP:LEAD. None of those articles use boldface properly. ROM and POL have no references at all. RUS has only 2 old refs, ARA only 1 old ref. DAN has 8. None of those articles have even ONE CITATION to a reference. The ``layout`` of those pages is not consistent.  In contrast, the Hawaiian phonology article (HAW), as originated by me, has a proper lead section, proper use of boldface, 8 references, and 70 citations to those references. HAW is one of the best-supported linguistics articles currently on Wikipedia.  I will undo your edits by restoring my last version of the article. Because you have persisted in ``forcing`` your unsupported and objected-to edits into the article, I will ask a Wikipedia administrator to take a look at the situation.

I agree that, per the BLP page, this could fall under its purview to a small extent. My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification.

innocuous,"`   Rjecina, calm down. Please, read my postings carefully, I have never said that Vlahs did not exist. Your comments are ludacris and off topic.    Zenanarh, thanks for the reply. I have read the link that you have posted about the term vlah. The website is called ``G-d, Bosnia and Bosniaks``, so i took all of the information describing Serbs with a grain of salt. I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with ``...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs.`` I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.  After reading the article, the Bosnian Vlah's were ``settled`` by Ottomans. Conversely, Croatian side Vlah's ``escaped`` Ottoman prosecution. This was a mistake in ``Serbs of Croatia`` article, which stated that Vlah's were settled by the Ottomans in Croatia.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",gzl9xG

And then in a blink of an eye despite the edit warring and context its somehow OK for him to have his tools restored very quickly by an editor I had a tiff with a long time ago after I said Pokemon cruft had no place in an encyclopedia. The editor has done nothing in 4 years, left wikipedia in a dispute back in July 2008 and has shown no evidence of actually why he needs an account let alone the tools again. Its sooo wrong, policies are valued here more than human decency and input. Why is this sort of thing accepted on here? I seriously question how wikipedia is run, I've seen some things during my time on here, but the way this has happened I find most outrageous. I'm not finding fault in admins for sticking to policies, I understand the need to stick to rules which have been made, but I'm finding fault with whatever consensus decided its fine for a desysopped admin to be given back his tools after doing nothing for 4 years and after he was engaged in an edit war as an IP and what appeared to be a sock account and how wouldn't stand a chance in a new RFA.♦  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",KOR6HQ

innocuous,"April 2011 (UTC)   I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",NIRihj

The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.  ::The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.  ::The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.  ::To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.  ::Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.  ::The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.   ::Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.  ::Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.  ::Howard, Clark.

The cities were (even more so then than now) very different, and fierce rivals.

innocuous,"`    Hi Everybody. Recently the page ``gravitational attraction`` where I expained the nature of gravitational attraction got redirected by vote 9:1 to ``gravitation`` that unfortunately contains inaccuracies in its desription of nature. So, since it seems that we have no much choice but to explain the gravitational attraction in ``gravitation``, we need to clean up the page to reflect what about gravitation is published in reliable sources.   For that reason whatever is contradicting the contemporary knowledge of gravitation in this page has to be changed to whatever reliable sources say about real gravitation rather than what some editors put for whatever reasons into this page. The first thing that I propose to change is the opening sentence ``Gravitation is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other`` since this is neither true nor reliable published source says so. It turns out that in our universe (as proposed by Einstein and we have to stick to it for already explained reasons) no object attracts any other. The alleged attraction is an over three centuries old prejudice, believed in also by many physicists, apparently for wrong reasons, since they couldn't come up yet, after so many years of trying, with consistent theory of quantum gravity. It should be finally explained why the behaviour of objects looks as they were attracted to each other. Between other things to allow those physicists to understand gravity better.  Before that though I propose to change this opening sentence back to what was there which read something like ``Gravitation is a phenomenon through which objects tend to get closer to massive objects in their vicinity``. After reaching an agreement on this first change we explain why they look as if they were ``attracted`` to thoses massive objects, as I did it in my redirected page. For now I'd like to have your agreement to this first change (which I expect knowing your opinions about Einstein might need some debate) and if the consensus is reached we might go on with this first and then with further improvements until we fix all the problems.

Then there is the Kodiak Brown Bear, which has been isolated on the Kodiak Islands and is the largest of all the Ursus arctos. It is considered a subspecies.  See: http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Ursus_arctos.html So biologists would call the Kodiak bears a separate ``race`` or subspecies, but the way we are using ``race`` here, the Alaska Brown Bear and the Grizzly Bear are different races.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself.   Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.  I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.  Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:   *``This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways: Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”.  So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance.   *Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states: “Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’.   *Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing  *- payment of dividends to shareholders; *- reduction of a company’s share capital or reserves; *- a company’s purchase of its own shares  *and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court``. So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010).

innocuous,"`A number of very high quality primary and secondary sources say that the British Mandate for Palestine was composed of two states, Palestine and Transjordan  *According to Howard Grief, a legal advisor to the government of Israel, ``Article 22 which established the Mandates System, was largely the work of Jan Christiaan Smuts who formulated the details in a memorandum that became known as the Smuts Resolution, officially endorsed by the Council of Ten on January 30, 1919, in which Palestine as envisaged in the Balfour Declaration was named as one of the mandated states to be created.`` .  He also wrote that Palestine was specifically created at the San Remo Peace Conference on 24-25 April 1920 as a mandated state.   *Article 434 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany was required to recognize the dispositions made concerning the territories of the former Ottoman Empire, ``and to recognize the new States within their frontiers as there laid down.`` The text of the treaty is available online  *Article 60 of the Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria contained identical stipulations. The text of the treaty is available online  *Article 74 of the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary contained identical provisions. The text of the treaty is available online      ``Great Britain had always treated Trans-Jordan as a political entity completely separate from Palestine.  Its inclusion within the framework of the Palestine Mandate was an outcome of the political events following the fall of Faisal's government in July 1920.  The Palestine–Trans-Jordan boundary served as a political barrier separating two states.  Therefore, the postulation by some writers that the boundary was merely administrative in its character, delineating two territories subjected to the one British rule within the British Empire has no foundation in reality.`` (p72)  *In 1924 the Secretary of the Colonies said that Palestine was a Mandated State. He wrote ``Negotiations have been in progress for about a year for the conclusion of a treaty with King Hussein of the Hejaz, who is the person to whom the McMahon promises of 1915 (see paragraph 5 of the office memorandum) were given. A draft of the treaty was actually initialled in London in April 1923, but difficulties have since arisen, particularly in regard to Article 2 of the draft, which deals with our position in the Mandated States of Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. See CAB 24/165, formerly C.P. 121 (24), page 1 (.pdf file 2 of 7)   *Prof. Paul De Waart recited the terms of the Montevideo Convention regarding states as persons of law  and said ``The Palestine Mandate has become an eventful example in respect of all the  constituents of statehood``. He devoted a separate subsection of the chapter to each constituent.  *Robert Eisenman explained that the British extended the concept of ``State Domain`` by defining a new category of ``Public Lands`` in the Palestine Order in Council of 1922 which was subject to control of the Palestine Government by virtue of treaty, convention, agreement, or succession, and all lands acquired for public benefit or otherwise. He observed in a footnote (17) that Article 60 of the Treaty of Lausanne vested all property and possessions of the Ottoman Empire in the governments of the relevant ``successor states`` and mentions that this was specifically applied in ``Palestine`` by the ordinances of 1925-6. See ``Islamic law in Palestine and Israel: a history of the survival of Tanzimat and Sharī'a in the British Mandate and the Jewish state, Robert H. Eisenman, BRILL, 1978, ISBN 9004057307, page 139    *In 1926 Norman Bentwich was the Attorney General of Palestine. He explained that the coming into force of Article 30 of the Treaty of Lausanne on August 26, 1924 allowed the three governments of Palestine, Syria, and Iraq to issue Nationality Acts. According to Bentwich, the guiding principle adopted was that Ottoman subjects habitually resident in the detached territories became ipso facto nationals of the state to which the territory had been transferred. Bentwich said the Nationality Laws transformed the de facto change into a change de jure. See Bentwich, Norman, 7 Brit. Y.B. Int'l L. 97 (1926) Nationality in Mandated Territories Detached from Turkey   *Norman Bentwich wrote that Palestine was an allied successor state to the property and possessions of the Ottoman Empire in ``State Succession and Act of State in the Palestine Courts``, XXIII Brit. Yb. Int'l L. ( 1946) 330, 333.   *Palestine was a party to multilateral and bilateral international treaties with the US, UK, Egypt, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, France, and etc. which described the signatories as ``contracting states``. Those treaties were published in the League of Nations Treaty Series. John Quigley wrote that those treaties constituted evidence that Palestine had the capacity to engage in foreign relations. According to Quigley, the most indicative treaty was one between the mandatory power, Great Britain, and Palestine. He said ``Had Britain and Palestine constituted a single sovereignty, there would have been no point to a treaty between them.`` See page 6   *The United States government formally recognized Mandate Palestine as a foreign state. In 1932 the Executive branch applied the most favored nation provisions of various commerce treaties to Palestine. In Kletter v Dulles the United States District Court, District of Colombia ruled that Palestine was a foreign state and that naturalization under Palestinian law constituted an act of expatriation under United States law: ``The contention of the plaintiff that Palestine, while under the League of Nations Mandate, was not a foreign state within the meaning of the statute is wholly without merit.`` and ``Furthermore, it is not for the judiciary, but for the political branches of the Government to determine that Palestine was a foreign state. This the Executive branch of the Government did in 1932 with respect to the operation of the most favored nation provision in treaties of commerce.`` See Elihu Lauterpacht, International Law Reports, Volume 20, Editors Elihu Lauterpacht, Hersch Lauterpacht, Cambridge UP, 1957, ISBN 0521463653, page 254.    *The US was a state party to the Treaty of Lausanne and the Anglo-American Palestine Mandate Convention of 1925 which provided that Ottoman subjects would become citizens of the States which acquired territory from the Ottoman Empire. The United States established a nationality quota for ``Palestine (with Trans-Jordan) (British mandate)`` See for example Proclamation #1872 - Limiting the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States on the Basis of National Origin, March 22, 1929   *US immigration law, U.S. TITLE 8, CHAPTER 12, § 1101. Definitions says ``(a) As used in this chapter— (14) The term “foreign state” includes outlying possessions of a foreign state, but self-governing dominions or territories under mandate or trusteeship shall be regarded as separate foreign states. The US is a state party to the Montevideo Convention, which it still considers to be ``in force``. See page 450 of United States Department of State Treaties in Force, A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2010    *In 1995 the State Department published a declassified Memorandum of Conversation between William Crawford Jr. and Mr. Shaul Bar-Haim from the Israeli Embassy (February 7, 1963) regarding Jerusalem. Bar-Haim said ``The use of the term ``Palestine`` is historical fiction; it encourages the Palestine entity concept; its ``revived usage enrages`` individual Israelis``. Crawford said ``It is difficult to see how it ``enrages`` Israeli opinion. The practice is consistent with the fact that, in a de jure sense, Jerusalem was part of Palestine and has not since become part of any other sovereignty.

innocuous,"`    I found this:  The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).  Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone).   I'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.  Other source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says ``134,000 captured``)  Still another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says ``81,000 killed``, etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)  How about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown?   Also, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:   Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.    `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",S5vmh6

It is extremely deceptive to say ``Treatment 'X' works because of the placebo effect`` - that's not how mainstream science says things.  : I once had a friend with a pounding headache - he asked if I had any Tylenol...I didn't, so I lied and gave him two Tic Tac mints instead (they look just like Tylenol pills!) - and within 10 minutes, the headache got better.  It probably would have gotten better anyway - and if it was some kind of stress-induced thing, perhaps he was de-stressed a little by knowing that his headache was going to go away soon.  So, here is the question: ``Do tic tacs cure headaches?``  No!  What (sometimes) cures or reduces some kinds of headache is the conviction in the patient that the pain will soon get better.  Do you expect us to edit the Tic Tac article to say ``Tictacs cure headaches via the placebo effect``?

It suggests that homeopathic cures are (say) 90% effective and that this is ``because of the placebo effect``.  That's extremely deceptive.  They work exactly as well as any sugar pill, mint candy or other 'treatment' that the patient would find credible.  : Caveat: My story about the friend, the headache and the tic tacs is not true - it never happened and it only worked as an argument because you believed in it...by the placebo effect if you like! -)  :   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",G0Ypiw

Following protracted warfare in the 4 century BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35%[8] and 40% of all Spartan land and property.[9] By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.[10] They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army.[8] Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20, and unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses[11] and went where they pleased. Girls as well as boys received and education, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the Gymnopaedia (``Festival of Nude Youths``).[8][12]   Girls as well as boys received !!and!! education  Semi-protected, can't fix.

innocuous,"` I'm not clear on your point here. The etymology of the word phallos doesn't determine or limit what the word phallus means in contemporary English. The vast majority of scientific terms are built from Greek and Latin roots. The question is article scope. If you do just a general Google books search on ``phallus``, you get a number of works from the humanities and the psychoanalytical tradition that treat the phallus as a form of symbology (these disciplines are connected through the Freudian and Lacanian recourse to classical mythology), as well as books that have the physiological meaning, including my favorite about ostrich phalluses. But how does it serve readers to conflate the two topics of physiology and symbology? The sources and methodology of these two uses are utterly different. They don't belong in the same article. For instance, in the section on ``phallic sexuality`` in the article ``Sexuality in ancient Rome``, it would be off-topic to provide a physiological diagram of the erectile functions of the penis, or a photograph of a penis. This has nothing to do with ``censorship,`` as other images in the article make plain, but with article scope. The physiological terminology with its attendant diagrams or photos belongs in one article, and the treatment of symbology and cultural constructions of the phallus in the other. Why is this a problem? That said, there is a massive amount of scholarship available on the symbology of the phallus, including feminist interpretations, and the article makes next to no use of it.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",poi0k9

Dr. Bernat's testimony was approved by the AAN Executive Committee. The two links provided document the testimony and the AAN approval.>   SlimVirgin deleted this embedded note, and then inserts into the same paragraph, an embedded note questioning the accuracy of the quote.  <Is this true? I seem to recall a case in England where a man woke up after a long time in PVS.><What levels of ``prognostic certainty``?:   -  ``During this time, the Schindlers allegedly encouraged Mr. Schiavo to get on with his life, and he introduced them to women he was dating.``  inserting the word ``allegedly`` might be technically not untrue, it casts a whole lot of doubt without any context. This statement about dating was reported by a guardian ad litem to the court. It is the guy's job to get the facts right, not present one pov. I can't recall, but I'm prety sure the guardian ad litem did not use the word ``allegedly`` in his report. and as far as I know, the Schindlers never challenged that statement at the time, either. Though I believe they may have challenged it much (years?) later, when they were willing to challenge anything possible.  There's a URL right by that line with an embedded note saying < quoting from page 11 of 38 of Wolfson report >, in case anyone was wondering where the ``alleged`` statement came from.   - The noise awoke Michael Schiavo, and he called 911 emergency services. <I'm deleting ``immediately`` wherever I find it, because it's journalese and usually unverifiable, not because I think it wasn't immediate.>``  Govorner Bush launched an investigation specifically into whether or not Michael called 911 ``immediately`` or whether there was foul play on his part. The DA recently dropped the investigation saying Michael's story was consistent and that the cause of Terri's collapse was probably cardiac arrest.   - ``(PVS), according to seven neurologists who examined her, or a minimally conscious state (MCS), according to one other.``  The dissenting neurologist suggested ``therapies`` that the court dismissed as quackery. If this neurologist is included in the intro, then his diasnosis as MCS needs to include the fact that his therapies are questionable.  -  Before: In March 1994, guardian ad litem John H. Pecarek was appointed by the court to determine if there had been any abuse by Michael Schiavo. Pecarek's report found no evidence for any inappropriate actions, and indicated that Michael had been very attentive to his wife. <Do not remove Pecarek's statement.

And it is replaced by a question of accuracy ``Did he really use that word?``   -  Before: Other neurologists — Drs. Jeffery M. Karp, James H. Barnhill, and Thomas H.

innocuous,"=Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:===  Dear Tiptoety,  I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.  This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else.   It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.    Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:    the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.    Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:  “This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.” Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195????   The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write up on Kasivisveswara temple built by the Chalukyas:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasivisvesvara_Temple   “The existence of a 1087 CE inscription on a beam in the temple mantapa (hall) and the plainness of that part of the temple suggests that the original construction may have been simpler and that the profusion of decoration may have been added to the other parts of the temple at a later period, with the end of Chola invasions of Chalukyan territory”.  This user also severely contradicts himself further while giving innumerable lectures to others about reliablity of sources etc. when his own sources of information are thoroughly unreliable, here is how:  please now visit the page of the first Western Chalukya king Tailapa-II:  Tailapa's victories  “The Cholas, who were experiencing a minor crisis of succession of their own were in a position of weakness. Uththama Chola had replaced Parantaka Chola II and Tailapa claimed victory in a battle against Uththama in 980”.    Strangely, the user has only mentioned two authors below this page namely K.A.N.Sastry and Suryanath Kamath as his sources but from both sources he has not been able to pin point which venue it was where Tailapa-II is supposed to have claimed his victory over Uthama Chola. Sir, it is well known in the anals of Chola history that Uthama Chola had his nephew Raja Raja Chola I the original claimant to the Chola throne as his general and both Raja Raja Chola I and his son Rajendra I are famous as two Kings of India who have never lost on the battle field. But that is not the question here… in Uthama Chola’s anals there never was a war with Tailapa-II, only his predecessor Sundara Chola fought against the Rashtrakutas and regained Thondaimandalam Nellore and nearby Telugu country, and Arcot areas from them.  Please read further from the same page:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailapa_II  Period of consolidation  In 992. Raja Raja Chola was vanquished and the Chalukya monarch secured one hundred and fifty elephants  Sir, please contrast with the crystal clear information given on the pages of the Chola king Raja Raja I: the relevant link is  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajaraja_Chola_I   “The southern kingdoms of Pandyas, Cheras and the Sinhalas were often allied against the Cholas.[3] It was the case when Rajaraja came to the throne. Rajaraja's initial campaigns were against the combined Pandya and Chera armies. There is no evidence of any military campaign undertaken by Rajaraja until the eighth year of his reign. During this period he was engaged in organising and augumenting his army and in preparing for military expeditions”.[4][5]  Sir, the above information is very significant in that Raja Raja was supposed to have ascended to the Chola throne in the year 985 and as per information on the page on Chalukya king Tailapa-II, Raja Raja I was supposed to have lost in battle to him in the year 1992.  The user has refused to make any changes to the page, nor is prepared to come up with any proof or verifiable evidence despite the fact that I have shown him extracts from Epigraphica Indica which have been carried on in the site www.whatsindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/ which has contributions from the former Archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India, but user Dinesh Kannambadi maintains that the findings of ASI have to be verified by historians of his choice.    Kindly see this further: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyasraya   Rajaraja Chola distracted the attention of Satyasraya by sending his son Rajendra Chola I to invade Rattapadi in the west and thus compelled him to withdraw his army from Vengi for the defence of his realm.  During his reign the Paramaras and Chedi reconquered the territory that they had lost to the Chalukyas earlier. But Satyashraya was able to defeat Raja Raja Chola and the crown prince Rajendra Chola when they invaded parts of Karnataka.  Sir, it is submitted that first of all it is pure jingoism when user Dinesh Kannambadi contributes that Satyashraya defeated both Raja Raja and Rajendra Chola when they invaded parts of Karnataka.  Kindly see this portion on the page on Satyashraya itself once again:  Seeing increased interference of Cholas in Vengi, Satyasraya invaded Vengi in 1006.  ''Wars with the Cholas  The Cholas responded with a two-pronged attack on the Vengi kingdom and on the Western Chalukya territory itself. The Chola armies were led by Rajendra Chola I. Rajendra marched up to Donur near Kudalasangama and Unakal near Hubli and plundered the entire county, slaughtering women, men and children and threatening the Chalukya capital Manyakheta.

innocuous,"`   This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of ``Russian torsion field weapons`` and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on ``The Philadelphia Experiment`` and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the ``saucers`` really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper ``On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics``. pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in ``this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics`` to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin.

I'm going to revert it back to the original. Feel free to add sentences or add to the article, but please do not delete the prior material that I wrote, as all of it is true, and from someone who was there from the beginning of the scene. Simply referencing a statement to an article does not make the data relevant. For example, this page is on a sub-genre of House. That does not mean you can include a sentence stating: ``Oprah has a new TV network, and they played Techno in the background on one of her shows``, and then you provided a reference from the newspaper. The fact that you provided the reference does follow the rules, but the sentence has nothing to do with the article on this page. That's why it was deleted. It could be added to a Disco music page though, or a Techno music page.  If you don't mind me asking, what year did you start collecting 'Progressive House' and what is the oldest record in your collection of it?  Regarding the Techno comments. Techno should be mentioned (as the sentence prior to it should be included), but that one sentence I deleted because it has nothing to do with Progressive. Also, Techno in general has little to do with Progressive. Progressive came from the House scene...specifically Acid House and very influenced from the Balearic sound of Ibiza. Techno was an influence but not the primary driver, and very little to do with Detroit.  Technically Progressive House was the next re-branding of House after Acid House, but I'm not going to get into this, it's too complicated.  If you have a problem with what is written, can you open the discussion on here, and explain your reasons, and we can both discuss before you start hacking away at the page.

innocuous,"` This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.  I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a ``diatribe``; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to ``justify`` my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.  The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as ``diatribe``, an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that  broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.  If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",UVx_06

Guys a Arvanite that says I'am Greek its not a Arvanit but a Greek!The ancestors of the arvanites where Albanian farmers and highlanders from Toskëria and Epirus!My great-grandfather was Arvanit..Arbanitika belongs to the linguistic family of Albanian.The first Christian Albanian migrations to central and southern(note: Albanian of north-western Greece are on Albanian native lands) of what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 & 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.  When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994). check this:http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Arvanitika or this http://www.traboini.com/al/public_02.html or ARVANITET By Irakli Kocollari Reviewed by Dr. Arben Kallamata    If u are Arvanit than translate this,my grandpa used to sing it to me:Moj e bukura Moré, si të lash më s´të pashë, si të lash, si të lash, si të lash më s´të pashë...  rri o laman se sje Arvanit ti po ik e shkërdheu me gjith Grek! The fustanella is albanian! The most maniotes are of arvanite origin, the have same customes as the northern albanian highlanders and the montenegrin highlanders!   Theodor Kollokotroni was atleast partially Albanian, one of his grandparents was from Delvina, southern Albania! He considered the albanians as his ``brothers by blood``!

You are all opinion, though ultimately we all are. Either way, the majority opinion of ``false`` is ``not true``; pseudo.

Because at this point, if it is true that Ehud is not claiming to be an Ehud Lesar anymore, if it is Adil he can ask anyone to provide identity to have him return, because he doesn’t need to prove he is Ehud Lesar. So this case should be taken to judge if there is sufficient evidence that Ehud is Adil or not.

innocuous,"`  There is an increasing number of Forbes Magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages.  The opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details, not subjective trivia.  Forbes 'most powerful' ranking is merely one American magazine editor's perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well-known person's 'power'.  By rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the Forbes magazine page or Forbes Magazine ranking page. It appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is, the more likely (s)he is to have a Forbes ranking on their wiki page.  Truly powerful people do not.  For example: Barack Obama (President, USA) - No mention of Forbes ridiculous ranking on his page Vladimir Putin (Prime Minister, Russia) - No mention of Forbes Dmitry Medvedev (President, Russia) - No mention of Forbes David Cameron (Prime Minister, United Kingdom) - No mention of Forbes Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister, Israel) - No mention of Forbes Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King, Saudi Arabia) - No mention of Forbes Nicolas Sarkozy (President, France) - No mention of Forbes Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader, Iran) - No mention of Forbes Naoto Kan (Prime Minister, Japan) - No mention of Forbes Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (Chief of Army Staff, Pakistan) - No mention of Forbes So why do the Forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki?  Is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki's expense?    :Sorry but what does this have to do with the main page? (Also while I have no opinion on whether Forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less 'powerful' and important person or celebrity is, the more likely they are to have a Forbes rating. You don't need a Forbes rating to tell you Barack Obama is important. You just need to words, 'President of the United States'. The same with all the rest you mentioned.)     ::Why do Forbes Magazine's unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki?  They are obviously fabricated.  Many are rubbish.  For example, Forbes rank Michelle Obama as the most powerful woman in the world.  Yet it is Barack who is the president, not Michelle.  As 'First Lady' Michelle has no power whatsoever. ::How about the number 2 'ranked' woman?  It is an American food saleswoman (Irene Rosenfeld).  What complete baloney.  Number 3 is an American television host (Oprah Winfrey), and finally at number 4 is a woman with real power, the Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel).  Forbes incredibly has ranked an American grocer and an American television host above a head of government. ::My question is, why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia (wiki) rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts? ::    :::So what does this have to do with the main page? :::If you don't think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles.

I am not as claimed, a pr crony for Jeffrey Epstein. I do though come from a science journalist background, had heard of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, and when I came across this article I was quite taken by the lob-sided presentation of this piece. It struck me immediately as slanderous vs. having a neutral point of view. MONEY LAUNDERING: the link that was added to back this, does not connect through. That is extremely problematic given that this is in the lead of the piece and libel if not properly sourced. I googled money laundering and Jeffrey Epstein and found the article url that mentions it but this is what I found, and I quote: ``Yet a source tells The Daily Beast that Epstein’s legal troubles may not be over. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, as an outgrowth of the 2007 Florida investigation, federal investigators are now looking into allegations of money laundering and other financial misdeeds. Villafana notes at the end of her letter to Lefkowitz: “You accuse me of broadening the scope of the investigation without any foundation for doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money transmitting business to the investigation. Again, I consulted with the Justice Department’s Money Laundering Section about my analysis...the duty officer agreed with my analysis.”   Something being ``possible`` in the press is not the same as something that actually ``is`` as claimed in the lead of the article. So, so far the lead is misleading and false. Unless you can find an article that confirms that he IS under investigation for money laundering, I think it should be removed. PROGRAM for EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS: this was entirely established from Jeffrey Epstein's $30 million, as was the research that was the first to mathematically quantify the in vivo kinetics of human cancer cells. That was a major achievement in the filed of cancer and I think it should be allowed back into the article.   Thank you for your thoughts. PS. I didn't use this talk page because I simply overlooked it and so went to your individual talk pages instead.

The ``Deutschen`` don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into ``Assyrian`` by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also ``Siryon`` or ``Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)``, which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites. Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. Even if the word Suryoyo derives from Assyrian ot doesn't change the fact that the Arameans where also known by this name.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",_IUP6t

I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia.   *Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.  *Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly.   *If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator.   *This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in ``enforcing`` wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your ``administrative`` tasks.

What Andy/Homey is attempting to do with his out of context Rouleau quotes is deny that the Crown/Monarchy is an institution shared equally by all 16 Commonwealth Realms.  What the MLC, and perhaps Canadian Heritage, promotes as Canadian is only the Crown in Right of Canada  the Crown as it operates within the legal jurisdiction of Canada. ``and legally it is not at all incorrect to refer to the Crown in Canada as the ``British Crown``.  Calling the Crown ``British`` for historical purposes, or due to the lack of a modern terminology for the shared Crown, is a matter of semantics, and does not affect constitutional reality that the ``British Crown`` as shared is not the same thing as the Crown within the legal jurisdiction of the UK. ``Gbambino's unique belief that something can only be in context if the entire document from which it is taken is included.`` Complete ignorance of my earlier statement: ``You've admitted you specifically chose those quotations because out of their context they support your POV and 'original research'. You've conveniently omitted those (and deleted those) that don't because they provide more information and create a clearer picture about what Rouleau's point was  and it actually goes against what you're trying to assert.``  Context does not necessarily mean the entire document, it means enough of the document to get the proper point across.

This is accepted by Canadian monarchists as reality, but is not their creation!

The Ferbuary-March Plenum of CC CPSU in 1937 led to the creation of Troikas that had legal authority to convict without a trial. Three members of Troika would judge an individual based on gathered testimonies, no lawyer would be present. This may be called ``repression`` under certain circumstances, which is debatable, but that's not the point.  The majority of CC CPSU voted for this and they had more political power than Stalin. So how come it only says that Stalin executed, persecuted, etc... And the sources are books written during Cold War era, on grants from USA. Or the sources are from ``unstable`` writes who name their books like ``Lenin, Stalin, Hitler``, placing Lenin, who, even according to wikipedia, was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, placing him on the same line with Hitler.

innocuous,"`  * Very good. I still think some spinoff articles would be justified because many believe that the MK article should be reduced to an overview, but readers have requested even more extensive details, such as what has Knox said about the first call to her mother. I was thinking of emphasizing all the crime experts who have gone to Perugia, talked with police, and interviewed the students or friends over there. Hence, create ``Investigations of the Kercher murder`` as a broader article, noting the prosecution/police viewpoint is just one investigation, then add Paul Ciolino, Joe Tacopina (ABC News ``20/20``: SeattleT-77), Steve Moore, etc. In that article, we would jump into the forensic details, and highlight the controversial evidence (or lack of motives) as noted in each investigation. That would allow for answering those reader questions about the details. Also, we need a separate article ``Amanda Knox`` because, unless that bio can be presented in a well-rounded way, she is inherently branded (for all of 2010) with the murder of MK. She is also notable for ``most-watched person on Italian TV`` and the other lawsuits, not just the MK case. This is like the reverse of ``Separate but equal``: Knox cannot be described in neutral terms, unless separated from the title & intro of the ``Murder`` article, where she is listed as one of the ``convicted``. In this situation, ``not separate is inherently tainted by the crime article, as equal to murderer`` and cannot present an NPOV view of a person. Since ``separate is unequal`` then not separate is equal. By extension, everyone still on trial (in a notable case) should be granted their own NPOV-neutral bio article, with their trial as only 1 section in their bios. So, if I formed a ``WikiProject Legal Cases`` then I would recommend separate articles for all ``presumed innocent`` who, later, could be merged back into the crime article when the typical appeals had ended.

innocuous,"`     I have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:  Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth?  You yourself must realize what is the truth.  So God cannot teach anything, except through a Master?  What is God?  You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.  Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?  Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.  Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?  Yes, that's why you call him a living Master.   Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?  At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.  What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge?  It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God.  Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth?  Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.    Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?  ......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.    The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads:  ``I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.``  He signs this last quote:  ``Guru Maharaj Ji``  I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said:  People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the ``old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.`` I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, ``You need peace.`` When people said, ``Tell us of the scriptures,`` I said, ``Look within you.`` When people asked, ``What is your qualification?`` I said, ``Judge me by what I offer.`` To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same.   Long after Rawat was ``only eight`` he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",WWVR7O

What were the differences between this and the Canadian claim? - Unsigned   :Actually, the current boundary does not reflect the maximal U.S. claim.  I'll try to trype in some more info.     :The British didn't exactly side with the Americans; the border settlement was an arbitration (the Kaiser again, IIRC, as it had been with his father at the end of the San Juans Dispute).  The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.  The main difference between the British hard position and the way things are now is that under the British terms, thet ``Yukon Ports`` - Skagway and Haines and Dyea etc would have been ``British``, i.e. part of British Columbia.  Canada didn't have a say in it, other than consulting London; British North American (Canadian) foreign affairs were still in London's bailiwick at that time (until 1931 or 1927 or something).  As it is under the treaty, the site of Forts Stikine and Taku should be within British Columbia; and in fact the mouths of the Stikine and Taku should be, but they've silted in a few miles downstream since the treaty was signed; the border hasn't been revised to reflect that (obviously not, even though it's in the language; same thing with the mis-survey of the 49th Parallel that's not going to get corrected, either).  There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on ``their`` side of that line.  Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the ``international waterway`` (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a ``foreign port`` to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed.     Just considering the opening statements; the treaty was actually between the British Empire, with the Dominion of Canada as a signatory party, IIRC; BC was not involved in the actual signing.  And just as aside the phrasing of the second condition of the treaty cited:  :Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.  ...is completely bizarre for anybody who's ever actually looked at a map of the coastline.  The negotiators were in London and Washington and Ottawa, far away with only the dimmest idea of where they were talking about.  Much the same as the Oregon Treaty, only worse; there ``the deepest channel`` seemed at least a bit logical, even though they didn't note the issues on the map with Point Roberts and the Gulf Islands/San Juans which make that border a bit of an absurdity; which so is the 49th Parallel from the Rockies west....that aside, the Alaska treaty issue cited is utterly bizarre; the Alaskan coast is a ragged array of inlets and bays, pierced by several large rivers.

Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.``  It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the ``Howard Johnson's`` scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman.   The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).  Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.  ``At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.``  Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.    ``As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.``  Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall.   ``After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).``  Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.  ``The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.``  Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.  ``Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",gLQw3e

The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, ``civilization`` game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.  Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available.

That ``truth``, or what you guys are shouting here as ``the common`` names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.

After extensive research though, my observation is that this tragic event, although very real, had nothing to do with Valentine's day per se and as such does not belong in this article on Valentine's Day.  It deserves the light of day and belongs perhaps in the 1342 events page, but the massacre had nothing to do with the celebration of Valentine's Day and I think it should be moved from an article that is supposed to be about Valentine's Day.  Secondly, the paragraph needs some accuracy.  The full story is that ``the authorities [of Stroudsbourg], who attempted to save the Jews, were overthrown by a fear-stricken mob led by the butchers' and tanners' guilds and by the nobles who were determined to do away with the Jews who were their economic competitors and to whom they were indebted for loans. Thus in this city, at least, it was not merely religious bigotry and fear of the plague, but economic resentment that fired the craftsmen and the nobles to their work of extermination.`` The current wiki paragraph just makes a blanket accusation against ``Christians`` and in light of the amplified details found at the website below, I sincerely believe the current paragraph should be moved and redacted once it winds up in the 1342 article which is where I would like to put it.  Please fell free to comment if you believe otherwise. Thanks!   Here's the scholarship from URL: http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1348-jewsblackdeath.html ``The second account describes the Black Death in general and treats specifically of the destruction of the Jewish community in Strasbourg. In this city the authorities, who attempted to save the Jews, were overthrown by a fear-stricken mob led by the butchers' and tanners' guilds and by the nobles who were determined to do away with the Jews who were their economic competitors and to whom they were indebted for loans. Thus in this city, at least, it was not merely religious bigotry and fear of the plague, but economic resentment that fired the craftsmen and the nobles to their work of extermination. Those people of Strasbourg, who had thus far escaped the plague and who thought that by killing off the Jews they would insure themselves against it in the future, were doomed to disappointment, for the pest soon struck the city and, it is said, took a toll of sixteen thousand lives.``  17:58, 14 February 2007`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",yNUDJx

There are currently no scientific research programs that take the astral projection interpretation seriously as there is no scientific evidence that astral projection represents anything more than anecdotal accounts of spirituality and meditation. Attempts to collect and classify accounts of these experiences date to the early 1920s. While some research before the 1980s sought to objectively validate out-of-body experiences, most treat reports as anecdotal accounts of spirituality and meditation. References to astral projection have appeared in parapsychology and transpersonal psychology, and have overlapped with other subjects essentially consciousness or death related. The term out-of-body experience (OBE) is often used interchangeably with astral projection, although the latter term is more anitiquated (OBE was coined in 1960 by Charles Tart primarily as a replacement for older terms such as astral projection).   Robert Crookall, a geologist interested in validating religious concepts of the soul and an afterlife, published hundreds of accounts of astral projection reported by people from all walks of life in several books through the 1960s and 1970s. He divided these into naturally-occurring out-of-the-body experiences (people who nearly died, people who were very ill, people who were exhausted, etc, and people who were quite well) and enforced OBEs, from anaesthesia, suffocation, accidents and hypnosis.Crookall, Robert. The Study and Practice of Astral Projection, copyright 1960 (before ISBN)  Robert Monroe, founder of the Monroe Institute, likewise published several accounts of his personal experiences and beliefs in astral projection in books like Far Journeys. Monroe said he developed a method for inducing the experience which he called ``Hemi-Sync``Monroe, Robert. Far Journeys. ISBN 0-385-23182-2  Charles Tart, a parapsychologist, conducted laboratory experiments to determine if these experiences have objective validity. For example, in a 1967 study, a subject was asked to discern a five digit number written down and placed face up in an adjoining room. Tart concluded that the subject was unable to read the number, but did provide some details of the activities of the technician monitoring the experiment. Tart summarizes, ``Thus, there is some indication that ESP may have been involved with respect to the technician's activities, but it is not at all conclusive.``http://www.paradigm-sys.com/ctt_articles2.cfm?id=31 Psychophysiological Study of Out-of-the-Body Experiences in a Selected Subject, by Charles Tart Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 1968, vol. 62, no. 1, pp. 3-27http://www.paradigm-sys.com/ctt_articles2.cfm?id=32 Second Psychophysiological Study of Out-of-the-Body Experiences in a Selected Subject by Charles T. Tart Published in the International Journal of Parapsychology, 1967, vol. 9, 251-258 Various other experiments along these lines were similarly conducted. Laboratory experiments like these which attempted to validate astral projection experiences, however, met with little acceptance, even within the psychical research community where they were conducted. Many psychical researchers regarded OBEs as simply a form of traveling clairvoyance and criticized the experimental methodology for failing to distinguish between the two.  While interest in paranormal aspects of out-of-body experiences has largely been relegated to non-academic fringe communities, a 2007 neurological experiment was conducted to examine what may lead subjects to feel they have experienced a mind-body separation. Experiments along these lines support the conclusion that the experience is an illusory product of sensory perception, rather than anything extra-sensory.

It's premature to portray the overall movement as deceased. However, solely with respect to Occupy Oakland, this is an issue worth discussing.

Occupy Oakland is the only one where the word ``ongoing`` appears—once on the Date line and again on a separate Status line.  I submit that Occupy Oakland's lack of activity over the past several months suggests that it may now be time to reconsider Wikipedia's use of ``ongoing`` applied exclusively to Occupy Oakland.  There is currently a small amount of autonomous organizing around two upcoming anniversaries: the group's October 10 birthday and the October 25 riot where Scott Olsen was shot in the head. However, none of this stems from Occupy Oakland collectively or any of its designated committees. It's being conducted strictly by self-appointed individuals. Even allowing that anniversary activities are likely to take place, the question looms: do these constitute evidence of an ``ongoing`` group or are they merely nostalgic gestures by a few diehard remnants?

It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get ``components`` of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function ``x`` on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni.

innocuous,"Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.   As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.     Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...   Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.

An article which you ostensibly started editing on 23rd September (and subsequently deleted various  valid content and citations) and on which you have done considerable work deleting and adding citations  as well as conflicting with other editors trying to contribute content .   Is this book a valid citation for a Wikipedia article or not ? Because you have been instrumental in both creating  this citation as well as condemning it . Since you have have stated yourself that you are not happy with this citation . *17th September Matthew Vanitas creates an article Kshatriyas and would-be Kshatriyas  *17th September  same day Sitush contributes to the article   and then improve the citation and article over next three edits starting with 25 October 2011 Sitush  *10 October 2011 Sun Quake  introduces Kshatriyas And Would-Be Kshatriyas citation on article Khatri. *User contributions Sunquake only posting on article Khatri .Account created for Sun_Quake Single-purpose account   *14th October 2011 Sitush  states I have never added Kshatriyas and Would-be Kshatriyas as a source, nor am I brilliantly happy with it as such....  *17th October sensing something is odd here I ask Can a wikilink be a citaion  17th October Page Talk:Khatri , See the section at the bottom of the page titled Lets take the case of citation 4 and b  *17th October 2011 On article Talk:Kshatriyas and would-be Kshatriyas I ask Is this book a valid secondary source for a wikipedai article  Whereas you state you are not happy with the citation , and yet it stays on the article inspite of your minute involvement with the article regarding edit contributions by others .   Is this book a valid citation for a Wikipedia article or not ?

innocuous,"`   This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?  Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``  The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.    Wikipedia's cons use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.  Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html  Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.  The Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America. When the Nazi party of Germany adopted the Roman salute from the Italian fascists.``  Wikipedia liars also used the painting ``The Oath of the Horatii`` http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html as absurd support for a Roman connection.  The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute   Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.  Recently, someone who posts to Wikipedia wised up and improved the ``Roman salute`` article some, while other pledge related articles are as bad as ever.  Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer ``public schools`` when they mean ``government schools`` and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called ``military socialism``) within government schools.  The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military.

Had the activists not attacked the boarding soldiers - no violence and no injuries would be sustained, as seen in other boats where the boarding end peacfully and without violence. No one has claimed that the IDF forged these photoes (FPA only claimed it shown certain photoes and not all of them).

innocuous,"`    Originally the article title was under ``Constitution of May 3, 1791``. This is the title under which it passed GA review.  There is some discussion about the name above , with alternative names suggested by an anon IP and pretty much opposed by all established editors who have been active on this article, including on bringing it up to GA.  Then however, before the discussion was concluded and any kind of consensus reached  moved the article to ``Polish constitution of May 3, 1791``. There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources.  Then  moved the article to ``Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791``. There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources. Actually this one's used in hardly ANY sources.  MK also messed with the ``http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_constitution_of_May_3,_1791&redirect;=no ``Polish constitution of May 3, 1791``] redirect which makes it pretty much impossible to manually move the article back to its original title without admin tools. Whether this was done deliberately as a salting or not, I have no idea.  The thing is that in order to move this article what SHOULD'VE been done is to have a proper REQUEST MOVE. Now we got a title which is not used by any sources and trouble moving it back.  Here's the break down on stats:  For ``Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791``  we have 2 hits. That's right two. And one of them is Moliere's Tartuffe so I don't think particularly relevant. The other hit, from Time-Life books, doesn't even have snippet preview so we can't check whether it's actually about the topic.  For ````Polish constitution of May 3, 1791``  we have 39 hits. That's thirty nine. Browsing through some of the hits, a lot of these seem to be very outdated (i.e. contemporary with the document).  For ``Constitution of May 3, 1791``, the original title that the article passed GA under, we have  87 hits. That's eighty-seven.   For ``Constitution of May 3``, without the 1791,  we get 114 hits. And it looks like most, if not all, of them are in fact about this document.  So ``Constitution of May 3`` or ``Constitution of May 3, 1791`` greatly outnumbers other variations that have been invented here on Wikipedia. Per WP:PRIMARY, WP:NOR, and WP:NC the article should be moved back to its original title. Then if there still any doubt about what the sources call this document, someone can start a proper WP:RM. `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",LQE6C1

innocuous,"`  ::Thanks for sharing that.  Sorry if my tone earlier might have offended you.  One of the first things I note, however, is that you were incorrectly assuming that the John W. Brown is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL).  It is not.  It is one of about 85,000 historic sites or objects and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland.  It is understandable that you would not know the distinction.  But, looking for the John W. Brown in search screens for NHLs cannot lead to success.  ::You did do well to find that Maryland Historical Trust webpage.  I happen to know that is a summary by them of the full NRHP nomination document, from my having gone through detailed comparisons of other such webpages to actual NRHP documents which are available online for some Maryland sites (including the NHL ones), in consultation with editor Pubdog a while back.  Pubdog developed most of the articles about NRHP-listed places in Maryland (indexed here).  I asked Pubdog to comment here on this page, and perhaps that would have helped.  ::The NHL URL that you reached, http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/REGIONS.htm, seems pretty good to me.  It gives you phone numbers to call, and it gives you NHL_info@nps.gov as an email address to send any inquiries.  I confirm that you found a bad link from that page;  when I click on Questions/Answers there i too see that it links to http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA which just gives an error message.  However you do already have all the phone and email contact info you need to ask about any National Historic Landmark.  I will email NHL_info@nps.gov to tell them that they have a bad link on that page, and I hope they will remove it to reduce anyone else's frustration.  ::I hope this helps.  I hope you do follow my advice in previous section to get the full NRHP document, since you do seem to genuinely care about developing this article on the SS John W.

innocuous,"` I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content, only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson, Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J. Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery (1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National Science Foundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math school teachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (later lost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation of complex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers from pairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives from CLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater than minuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standard multiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) + (-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must act as a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying product rule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) = 24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule. This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which I initiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math. Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's ``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The other axioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` So CLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",Z0z3sB

innocuous,"`    Sorry to bring this up after all the debate and resulting conclusions, but the WP definition of aircraft is at odds with standard world-wide ICAO terminology.  From Title 14 FARs Section 1:  Aircraft means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air [includes all flying machines, with or without wings]. Thus, balloons, flying pigs, and F-15s are all aircraft.  Airplane means an engine-driven fixed-wing aircraft heavier than air, that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings [refers to aircraft with wings only]. Thus, an F-15 is an airplane, but a balloon is not an airplane.  [Airplane and aeroplane are mostly interchangeable]  The FAA definitions are identical to the European JAR definitions and the Canadian CARs definitions because all personnel licencing is based on the basic ICAO standard.  I notice this confusion happens throughout WP on many topics because of the large number of inexperienced editors. Perhaps it's just the enthusiastic revisionist ignorance of youth?

innocuous,"`    This article is currently blissfully unaware of the historical debate about Arnold's role at Saratoga. Here's what the article says:  :Historians agree that Arnold played an instrumental role in the outcome of the Saratoga campaign, showing courage, initiative and military brilliance. He is said to have almost singlehandedly cut off Burgoyne's attempt to escape in the decisive Battle of Bemis Heights.  Here's what Mark M. Boatner's Encyclopedia of the American Revolution says:  :It is amusing, however, that while some writers credit Arnold with winning the two battles of Saratoga almost singlehanded, others question whether he even was on the field in the first battle and maintain that the second was won before he charged in to lead a costly, useless attack. (p. 31-2)  Our article goes on to say that ``neither can there be doubt as to his crucial role in the Battle of Saratoga...``, but of course, as Boatner's article indicates, there's been a lot of doubt about it. Ward's The War of the Revolution has an appendix devoted to the topic, and like most historians, he concludes that Arnold was present at the battle. But a number of historians in the past doubted it.  Boatner also regards the story of Arnold being buried in his Continental Army uniform as ``improbable``.  Hopefully someone familiar with the historiography will someday write a well-informed article on this guy, covering the way Arnold's actions have been debated over the years.  |  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",lni9AO

Rowse, Homosexuals in History, New York: Carroll & Garf, 1977. page 44 Rictor Norton, Rictor Norton, ``Sir Francis Bacon``, The Great Queens of History, updated 8 Jan. 2000 http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/baconfra.htm, Alan Stewart, Jardine, Lisa; Stewart, Alan Hostage To Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon Hill & Wang, 1999. page 148, Louis Crompton, Homosexuality and Civilization; pp388-391 and Joseph Cady. Nieves Mathews is among the few modern writers to take an opposing view,Mathews, Nieves Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination, Yale University Press, 1996 claiming that the sources are not conclusive: (1) a quote from the private diary of Simonds D'Ewes (Bacon's enemy in Parliament, but considered to be a responsible and scrupulous lawyer), (2) a quote from Brief Lives by John Aubrey (written after Bacon's passing): he ``was a pederast`` and ``had ganimeds and favourites``, (3) and a note by Ann Bacon in which she expressed disapproval of the friends Francis and Anthony were associating with (since one was a ``Papist`` and money was owned to her sons: ``that bloody Percy [who Bacon kept] as a coach companion and bed companion.``). Coaches were one of the few private spaces at the time, thus the term ``coach companion`` is a clear reference to sexual doings.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",vrjiuk

I DO NOT HAVE or EVER HAD an attorney contacting Wikipedia. This is on outrageous claim.  I AM a researcher of well-known court cases, and have researched the Sante Kimes case in the past.  SUBJECT BAN * 1. Since an administrator asked me to voluntarily not edit anything on the Sante Kimes article, I have complied.   *2. If those interesting in my edits to the Sante Kimes article, please just see the article's edit history. Since making editing mistakes on my FIRST-EVER edits on Wikipedia, I have complied with the appropriate editing guidelines. Namely, *Posting in the discussion page of the article about ANY large edits I felt appropriate for the article. * Placing details and reason for the edit in editing tags.  :Please see the article's editing history to see that the only edits I have made were to correct dates, spelling mistakes, adding verifying tags, and making small corrections to the article that were needed. Furthermore I gave full details for the changes I made in the editing notes Please see the article's editing history to confirm this.  *3. The only edit that I made that was in debate was the article's 'lead' info. I do contend that the current 'lead' starting with ``American felon`` was placed there as an action of spite by that editor.  The 'lead' I placed WAS of a neutral POV, factual WITH EXACT dates for the named convictions and was supported by references.  The current 'lead' does not state the dates for when these conviction took place.  Furthermore, I had placed ``American woman`` in the 'lead', which IS in the 'lead' of various other female criminal's articles who (arguable) allegedly committed WORSE crimes than Sante Kimes is accused of committing. If it's appropriate for those articles, why is it not appropriate for this article?   :In closing, I DID follow editing guidelines for the Sante Kimes article after I learned what was acceptable editing. Furthermore, I discussed - at length - in the article's discussion page about changes that I felt WERE needed. Yet I NEVER took it upon myself to edit those issues until an agreement could be reached.   *I would like to point out that those changes have yet been agreed upon and I HAVE NOT made any edit in regard to those issues. Therefore, that demonstrates that I am following the editing guidelines.  Because of an apparent personal problem an administrator has with me. - Which is the same editor I was in dispute with on this article's discussion page They have asked me to voluntarily not edit the article - or, most outrageously, not EVEN post on the article's discussion page to discuss the issues with this article.(How is this not considered conflict of interest??)

You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).     ::*``Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.``    ::*``On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``     ::The Mitchell Report: ::*``Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``    ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right.  ::``* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded. ::* August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day. ::* September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. `` ::Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",ksf5q0

Dear Fredil, thank you so much for your beautiful words, your kidness and your trust in me. My Request for Adminship is finally over, and the support and appreciation that the community has gifted me will stick in my mind as long as I live. I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all you've done for me, and all I can tell you is, I'll try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons... and if I mess up, make sure to  and give me a good yell! ) Seriously, tho, if you ever need my help, either for admin-related stuff or in any other way, you'll always be welcome to message me, and I promise I'll try my very best. Dear Fredil, I know that your faith in Wikipedia is shaken right now; and tho I didn't have the pleasure of talking to ILP myself, I also feel that his departure is saddening indeed. In moments like this, when everything looks dark, is when friendship, true friendship, shines with a brighter light. ILP understood the value of that friendship better than most people do. I can't think of a better way to keep his thoughts a living part of our project, than offering myself as your own friend; and know that I don't take such an offer lightly. Valuable and great peple like you are rare to find, dear Fredil. There is much beauty in this place, and wonderful people. Don't let the darkness take over you - I'll do my very best to help you keep the light shining bright, I promise ) With a big hug, your friend,    ♥   :Inspiring words.

A note for when you get back: I noticed that you use a template as a signature. Please don't do that, as it's a drain on the servers. You can read the details about that here and elsewhere, there have been some discussions about this in the past. Thanks!      Message was put on my user page.  Hey Fred, remember me? I didn't check to see wether or not you replied my previous edit, although I had a doubt wether or not it was actually you. If, in case, you are not Fred Yu, then please disregard this message. If you are Fred, read on. Where did you go on vacation? Was it China? Or possibly Hong Kong? (OK, I'll stop the stereotypical vacation spots for ``Yu``). I'm only asking because I want to rub something inmy 1337 $$$-filled vacation in Paris,France; Mangalore,India; New York, New York; and Las Vegas, Nevada. By the way, I won $543.67 in Las Vegas when I dropped a qaurter in a slot machine and pulled the lever...that's right, the first time i really gambled, I won! HA HA HA!!! FEAR MY 1337 SKILLS!!!! And if you don't fear my 1337 skills, remeber that I'm rich, and I could buy you, and I mean ``Yu``. If Yu read this, please send me an email. Yu know my email address, don't Yu? PS REMEBER THE V-BROW!!!    EDIT  So Fred, good to see it is YU. (OK, I'll stop with the pun). Of course, I doubt you'll see the end of Dr. F. Yu! Anyways, I did read your post on my talk pagesorry for ruining your user page, I swear it was an *cough* accident *cough*. Now to brag about my vacation, which did not (thankfully enough) involve Alex stealing my suitcase with my iPod and PSP. Video games are 1/2 price in India! Same game, $30 less. Of course it doesn't matter, since I love to waste money. On another note, using the same $500 I won in Vegas, plus a few months of salary...remember, that's $200.00 a month for doing NOTHING...I bought a 50`` plasma tv for my bedroom. That's right, and it looks great!! Enough about me though, I think it's time to laugh at other people! *More coughing* Jon I *more coughing*. Still, have a nice vacation, and remember that I am currently too lazy to check my user talk page or my email, meaning all 5 of my email addresses, which are vinnie12344@hotmail.com, gmail.com, and yahoo.com; vinnie123@yahoo.com; and vinnie1337@hotmail.com to actually reply to anything you send, however, I am not saying you shouldn't try but in fact that you should keep spamming me until I reply. See Yu next year!   -I know I said I wouldn't say that, but I had to!!!      Good luck with your wikibreak, I hope it helps to destress so that you can resolve issues well.     Agreed. I hope you enjoy your vacation.

Mohamed admits that much himself, and also makes statements consistent with that (for example, on the amount of time put into his clock project). This is significant and noteworthy because the news media's coverage on this aspect of the situation has been misleading, by and large. Many teens have built clocks from scratch (and I'm not saying Mohamed also couldn't, or perhaps did at another time, but in this case, he clearly didn't); I've read many comments on different sites about people who did so as teens. Yet the media presented this as that he made the clock from scratch, and that was the basis for not only the perception that on the basis of this clock project alone, Mohamed is extremely talented, but also as part of his story on why he made the clock which the officials reacted to with suspicion. You can see the difference in that if Mohamed had spent some days or even hours on a truly homemade clock project, that clearly would have an impressed his teachers. Yet he spent minutes on a project in which he merely reassembled parts from a manufactured clock, and that teachers told him resembled a bomb. So this is an important part of the incident, given that it directly relates to the controversy in that it appears to be a factor in the school and police officials' questions over his motivations behind the project.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",x-hDPf

The LTTE, on the other hand, feared that the accord was but an Indian ploy to thwart its plans to secure an independent ``Tamil Eelam``.  From the mid 1980s, the LTTE has believed that India is basically using Tamil militancy in Sri Lanka only to browbeat Colombo into backing its own geopolitical interests.  ... India did help the Tamils get a modicum of recognition and power through the unification of the Tamil-speaking North and East and the setting up of a North Eastern Provincial Council (NEPC) with some devolved power under the new 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution.  But to the LTTE, the 13th amendment was a far cry from an independent Tamil Eelam.  ...``       someone edit the info about the  rajiv gandhi murder by LTTE and put in alleged   someone removed the line about rajiv gandhi being murdered by LTTE, and said it was alleged. It is not alleged the indian court some proved it was done by the LTTE and have passed sentence on it. even anton balasigham in a press conference in 2002 accepted it and said it was a regrettable event.  I also edited these  ````Many nations have contributed Tsunami aid to help Sri Lanka but it is alleged that much of the money has been swindled by politicians. It is estimated that only 17% of the relief aid has been spent on what it was intended for.````  none of this have been proved, also the politicians have alleged that its the NGO's which are swindling the money.   ```` In December 2005, following a brutal gang rape and murder of a Tamil woman by Sri Lankan Soldiers (Ilayathambi Tharsini)(such incidents have happened many times before, including Krishanti Kumaraswamy), ````  this has not been proved as done by the navy, only the ltte says so  a encyclopedia is not a place for alleged information, it should be based on facts.    Please note this is an Encyclopaedia and not a Buddhism class under a tree in Sri Lanka. Mahavamsa is a myth, and is world renowned for being such. Further the topic of pre-history is hotly debated by many scholars, and any description must include the fate of the Jaffna Library which contained several thousand artefacts, supportive of the Tamil version.    Yes since those artifacts are no longer avaiible or are around to prove such things you can only assume they supported the Tamil verision, for all we know they have have supported no side, secondly this is not a political debate this is a encyclopedia not a place to rewrite history or too air your personal views. We have to mainatin neutral tone regardless of our own personal opinions, unless you can come up with credible source for such information please stop editing pre-history and other parts of SRi Lankan articles if you are going to make them poltically bias. For example you stated the ``Sri Lankn parliament permanantly has a buddhist majority who abuses its power``.. this is not porven secondly the North-East areas controlled by LTTE were not allowed to vote becuase of the LTTE ban and intimidation on them. How can this be blamed on others?, it is  recorded by most   human rights, international observers taht LTTE carried such actions out. Therefore your claims about ``permanant majority`` are false and secondly you have no creible source to back up such a claim.   Thank you    Regardless of which side of the coin the artefacts in Jaffna Library may have supported, a mention of the Library and its fate are essential to any neutral account of Pre-History. The fact that the library was burnt down by Sinhala mobs and Sri Lankan MPs, speaks volumes in itself.  Secondly, can you name me a non-Sinhala Buddhist President of Sri Lanka? Or even a Prime Minister for that matter.  It is widely accepted SWRD came to power in 1956, riding on Sinhala Buddhist sentiments.  Look at the census of Sri Lanka; you would know that the island has a Sinhala-Buddhist permanent majority.  You also have to accept the fact that the Mahavamsa is a MYTH.

Of course, it's not impossible that one or more examples could have been retrieved from the driver training fleet and reinstated to passenger service.  However, the Volvo B10BLE with Wright Renown bodywork, plenty of which are still in use, is visually almost identical to the Endurance, so I wonder if these could be what you're seeing?  From the outside, the easiest way to tell the difference is that the Endurances were M- or N-registered, whereas most of the Renowns are R- or S-registered.

innocuous,"`  You previously claimed that ``Einstein did not introduce [Maxwell's equations] as an explicit postulate, any more than he did the rest of classical physics``, but now you conceed (finally!)that he adopted Maxwell's equations as one of his ``principleS`` in his paper giving a heuristic argument for mass-energy equivalence, and you also conceed the obvious fact that this is (as Einstein noted with the ``of course`` that you're so fond of) tantamount adopting the principle of lightspeed invariance.   To really appreciate this you have to ask yourself what it means to adopt Maxwell's equations as a principle. Those equations can be reconciled with the principle of relativity in (infinitely) many different ways. To give this principle meaning, we must assert (among other things) that the parameters appearing in those equations take the same numerical values when evaluated with respect to any system of inertial coordinates, as operationally defined. Now, the key parameters characterizing Maxwell's equations are the electrostatic and magnetic units, whose ratio is the speed of light, so the only way of postulating Maxwell's equations in a sense compatible with special relativity is to assert that the speed of light has the same numerical value with respect to any system of inertial coordinates. If you do not explicitly stipulate this, the postulate of ``Maxwell's equations`` is hopelessly ambiguous, and does not suffice to single out the Minkowski metric. Conversely, if you DO stipulate the invariance of the ratio of electric to magnetic units, then none of the remaining assumptions entailed in Maxwell's equations (some of which are invalid) are needed. This is why, as Einstein specifically said, he avoided postulating Maxwell's equations in the derivation of the Lorentz transformation. So, your claims are falsified in several different ways (so many that it is becoming tedious to enumerate them).  Look, the result from the first paper on which he bases the second paper is the equation for the energy of an electromagnetic wave with respect to relatively moving systems of inertial coordinates. This comes from Section 8 of the first paper, which is in the ``Electrodynamic Part`` of that paper, in which he applies the Lorentz transformation  - derived in the ``Kinematic Part`` of the paper, based on the two postulates - to Maxwell's equations. At the conclusion of the Kinematic Part he says  We have now derived the required propositions of the kinematics that correspond to our two principles, and we will now proceed to show their application in electrodynamics.  So you see, he has already derived the Lorentz transformation, which as he repeatedly stressed is the entire content of special relativity, and he is proceeding to apply this to one particular class of physical phenomena, namely, Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. In this part of the paper he derives the relativistic expression for the energy of an electromagnetic wave (in accord with Maxwell's equations), and it is this result that he uses in the second paper. This is why he says in the second paper, referring to the first, ``There I based myself on the Maxwell-Hertz equations``. He is saying this is the basis of the expression for the energy of an electromagnetic wave, but of course the relativistic form comes from applying the kinematics of special relativity, which was derived in the first part of the earlier paper based on the two postulates of relativity and lightspeed invariance.  If you have any understanding at all of the actual content of those two papers, his statements are perfectly clear and cannot possibly be mis-interpreted. Your claims are falsified in so many different ways that is becomes ever more tedious to enumerate them. You conspicuously decline to reconcile your claims about Einstein ``dropping the second postulate`` with the fact that in over a dozen papers written over the next fifty years of his life he consistently asserted the primacy of the lightspeed postulate, often listing it first rather than second. And you refuse to comment on why he repeatedly made statements explaining why he based special relativity on those two postulates and NOT on Maxwell's equations. And on and on.  All we're doing here is proving the wisdom of the Wikipedia rules designed to suppress physics cranks. It does no good to argue with physics cranks. All we can do is insist that the article contain ONLY sourced statements from reputable publications. My version is thoroughly sourced. The alternate version is essentially just an unsourced statement of some editors opinions.

innocuous,"`    Daoism may be any of the following;  1)  A school of philosophy, strictly philosophy, as a means for understanding spiritual matters and for a different perception of the world.  2)  It can be religious, and employ the worship of various gods through the use of idols.  3)  It is also known for sorcery; the idea of the 5 elements, earth, fire, water, metal and wood, and their manipulation, are as old as China itself in fact even older.  Ultimately all witchcraft regardless of region, originated from Shamanism.  The branch of Daoism that deals with sorcery, in fact has its origins in Chinese shamanism before ``China's ascent from the darkness`` (``darkness`` e.g. ignorance).  One of the errors made regarding Daoism, is how it is seen as a single system, when in fact, different branches of it can be as different from each other, as night and day.  For example, even though Daoist philosophy urges simplicity, Daoist sorcery, involves heavy ritualization, the humming of various sounds through the practice of Chi Kung, etc.  In other words an accusation may be thrown as mystical Daoism, as not being TRUE Daoist philosophy because of the heavy ritualization that makes it far from simple.  Not a personal opinion, just an illustration.  However, because there are branches of Daoism that deal with mysticism, they are worth a mention.  Additionally, even withing ``magical`` Daoism there are different beliefs.  For example, as with ``traditional`` witchcraft, there is the use of familiars.  However, some forms of mystical oriented Daoism worship Shangdi (``the one true God``) and hold the claim that all comes from Shangdi.  Now, mind, worship of Shangdi does not imply, it is an Abrahamic faith; the rites, rituals and prayers are totally different.  Moreover, because the worship of Shangdi in China has always been influenced by Daoism, it is nowhere near as dogmatic, as merciless, towards ``heressy.``  In fact, most Chinese religions have no concept of ``heressy.``  I am starting to soapbox here, so I'll stop typing; please look into Daoist magical practices and consider expanding the article.    stardingo747`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",LZ3EG0

When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile.

Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",QJVtO7

Plus, the mistakes are only concerning a dozen or so odd years. Nothing particularly glaring unless you're a gun nut.  19:14, 21 December",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",VYAA2P

The reason for the delay in VotDT production was in fighting between Walden Media and Disney. Walden was very upfront about not having PC open in the summer as it would do better as a Christmas movie. Aslan being an allegory for Christ and what not. Disney did what they wanted and as a result prooved Walden Media right. As result of telling the mouse what to do and proving him wrong Disney dropped the franchise and thus production of VothDT had to be halted until a new distributor could be found.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",_bS2ES
