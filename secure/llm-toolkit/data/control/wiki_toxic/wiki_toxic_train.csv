Under the Russian Empire, the rayon was an north-eastern part of the Kazakh uyezd of the Elisavetpol guberniya. 2.  needs to cite the references where he got the figures 39% Armenians and 57% Azerbaijanis from. 3. This sentence does not reflect the historical reality: ::``After the British left and more fighting between Armenians and Azeris ensued, Bolshevik forces gained control of the region and annexed it to the Soviet Union`` Britons have left Caucasus in 1919, while Bolsheviks took over Azerbaijan (first in Caucasus) on April 28, 1920, Armenia was taken by Bolsheviks in November 1920. Soviet Union was created in 1922. So obviously Bosheviks could not have annexed it to the Soviet Union. Kazakh uyezd was part of Azerbaijan (Elisavetpol governorate was designated so by Britons), which under Bolshevik rule was divided between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 4. ``Neither country has disputed this boundary since`` quote is not true. Armenia occupied one of the exclaves of Kazakh rayon, called Yuxari Askipara during 1991-1994 active phase of war.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",v4_dKS

Walker February 2006    With this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’, and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).  Angela Kennedy & Jane Bryant, The One Click Group to Jimmy Wales.  17 November 2005. http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/More%20Wikipedia%20On%20Wessely.doc  One Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots. And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely.  Just Z  G, you know? [T]/[C] AfD? 15:46,  19 December 2005 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely   A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies.    Since 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants.    Professor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations.    Just before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME.    When this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‘edit police’ who cruise the pages seeking ‘vandalism’ and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia’s self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him.   Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas.    When, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality – ‘we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute’ - the debate entered another level.   It seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know? (Clearly I have no intention of using this onanistic sobriquet in this essay and so will refer to him as ZG)   There ensued an argument, about One Click’s contribution to the Wessely entry, which though handled with cool clear minded determination by OC, degenerated into bad language and scatological rebukes from male Wikipedians,.   G, my warmest compliments & wikihug for putting up with the faecal matter of One Click.                                                  JFW T@lk 20.51, 19 December 2005                          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely   Air Brushing Out the Context   I do not want to get embroiled in any of the detailed arguments about the meaning of concepts and words, which became to some degree the subject of this row. What seems more important is the way in which Wikipedia, a cult-like project employing its own acronymic language, evidently believed that it could re-create, define and separate the  experience and perception of Professor Wessely  held by thousands of ME/CFS patients from any biographical account of the man himself.   I have made the forked version live. As outside editors are converging on the fork after an awareness campaign by One Click I see no point in hiding it further. Criticisms of hagiography are likely to persist from those people who feel Wessely's research has caused ``mental health`` stigma of chronic fatigue syndrome, and there will be a lot of reverts until the partisans learn the importance of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:CITE.   (Jfdwolff) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely  The quote above shows not only the insider argot of the group, but also their seeming incapacity to understand what the grounds for opposition were from OC. One Click does not, for instance, complain about the stigma of a ‘mental health’ diagnosis; rather, it objects strongly to Wessely’s psychiatric diagnosis forming the basis for treatment modalities when no biophysical research has been carried out.    Nor does OC, generally speaking, refer solely to chronic fatigue syndrome, which is an all embracing Wessely nomenclature which has taken root in Britain and the US after Wessely ‘did away’ with ME. One of the planks of the OC campaign has been the fact ME/CFS is classified by the WHO as a neurological disease under ICD-10 G93.3. In their texts, OC has always been careful to refer to the illness as ME/CFS, so retaining the status of the original illness ME, and stressing the physical aetiology of these illnesses generally.    By making errors of this kind, however small they might appear to those who make them, either purposefully or by error, the Wikipedia editors and writers determinedly stated one side of the discourse. The arrogance of Wikipedia is also shown in this quote, in which the writer expresses the view that critics will come to their senses when they learn the Wikipedian rules, and language!   I will argue that biographies about the contentious lifestyle or work of prominent individuals are utterly without use or intelligent direction if they cite only ‘facts’. What is more, accounts that cite only facts in uncritical biographies of contentious individuals, inevitably ‘take sides’ with that individual and the social effects of their words and deeds.    I will cite a simple example, which is extreme and has nothing to do in its substance with Professor Wessely (I have to stress this here, because no doubt next week I shall be accused of saying that Wessely is a Nazi).     In writing biographical text about Alfred Rosenberg, the senior ideologue of the German Nazi Party between 1930 and 1945, a compiler or writer who cited only his published writing and his rise within the hierarchy of Hitler’s parliamentary party would be obscuring the less verifiable fact that his ideology and policies led to the deaths of 11 million Jews, Gypsies, gay, disabled and other human beings. Rosenberg, who was himself of Jewish extraction, was executed after a trial by the Allies in 1946.   Information is power, and the most powerful information, goes almost unnoticed as a convincing part of everyday culture. Every reason it is possible to find, argues that this information is rational and based upon a majority view, while in reality it is simply the prejudices of the most powerful minority groups, which often remains unquestioned by the majority.    If Wales and ZG were to have stuck honestly to the understanding of rounded neutrality in their Wikipedia entry for Professor Wessely, it would read something like this, little more, little less:  Professor Simon Wessely has worked as a psychiatric medical researcher, mainly in Britain at the Institute of Psychiatry between 1985 and the present. Professor Wessely has argued on the basis of his research results that many apparently environmentally-provoked illnesses are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’ perceived and presented by their sufferers as physical illnesses but having no basis in biological fact.

However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here. #I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here!

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.

I have been blocked in circumvent of the rules by a POV admin. The article should be restored to the pre-edit war status  Nixer, you reverted that article four times. I have blocked you for only 24 hours, although your repeated 3RR violations would usually warrant more, as would your ``POV admin`` remark above.     :Taking no position whether Nixer  deserves a block for revert warring, I must note that 4 reverts accumulated in 36, not 24 hours as per this. Staying under 3RR is no entitlement in any way and general revert warring is subject to admin's discretion blocks. However, in such case the admin should be uninvolved, unlike  who was one of the editors who reverted Nixer. Again, I take no position on whether Nixer should be blocked for RV warring in general, just noting that technically 3RR is not there and blocking by admin who participates in article disagreement is highly inappropriate in such case.  :All this aside, Nixer, you should cool down finally.    ::Three of Nixer's reverts were within 24 hours and the fourth was the following morning, which I reverted, but subsequently restored. Furthermore, I am not a recent editor of this article, and am not thrilled by the attitude presented by either Nixer or the editors reverted; if there had been any genuine discussion, they might have been able to reach a compromise, as they were both presenting opposing nationalistic views. Nevertheless, he reverted the article four times in a row without discussion, while  and the others did not. Sadly, he has a long track record of such behavior.    :::Please look the talk page more precisely. The discussion is going and all sides present their arguments. I do not revert without pointing my arguments in the talk page. The first edit of my opponents seemed to me as vandalism because they performed mass deletion of valid info.

I'm appaled at the suppression of data about the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators. It is even less acceptable to abuse 3RR in order to block one's opponents. I advise all interested parties to move their dispute to WP:ANI, with a stern warning that Holocaust Denial will not be tolerated.     ::::There is no holocaust denial, dispute is about the fact that was the participation in holocaust enough importnant to put it in article that is meant to be short overview or not. If Holocaust there actualy quite small amount of Estonian collaborators participated is mentioned then a lot more  things that were at similar or bigger scale need to be mentioned and that would make article too long. Also Nixer's version has factual mistakes in it. ( ) :::::I've already corrected the mistakes you pointed. If you know some things of bigger scale connected to participation of the Baltic states, please point them.  ::::::The murders and deportations of Estonians between June 1940 and August 1941 were much more numerous than Holocaust victims of Estonia, but in your opinion it shouldn't be included ()   :::::::The Estonian SS units participated not only in Estonia, you see? And Estonians murdered all 100% Estonian Jews. Do you think it is not worth enough to be mentioned? Holocaust victims were murdered, not just ``deported``.

Lack of technical 3RR is not a foolproof defence. Even though 3RR is a policy for a reason and should be applied in most cases, some revert warriors permanently stay 1 step under 3RR and do nothing but reverting. This should not be allowed. If PO thinks that this is the case here (sterile revert warring technically under 3RR) he should NOT have said that the block is for 3RR but he should make it clear that this is a judgement block imposed by his own decision based on the evidence that Nixer was involved in a sterile revert war despite staying under 3RR. At the same time Nixer claims that he was not running a revert war but attempted a discussion at talk which was ingored by his opponents. Whoever studies this (or PO himself) needs to take a good look on all details.  However, Nixer is indeed known as generally a hot-headed guy, even though I commend his committment to add content to Wikipedia. He may be right or wrong but in any case he gets excited too much. Nixer, an advise. Do not revert any article more than twice in any 24 hours even if your opponents are ``wrong`` and otherwise ``bad``. I almost guarantee that by adopting this you will not be blocked for revert warring. Now, please seize attempts getting yourself unblocked. It is only 24 hours. Take a break and come back tomorrow chilled out.   Regards,   ::Irpen, thank you very much for commenting.

innocuous,"`     :though your suggestion is appreciated, it's a bit presumptuous.   I use the ``Shoe preview`` button ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT, overall, in articles.   The problem, Nova, is that you think somehow that I was just birthed on WP from a cabbage truck, and no next to nothing about policy and options.    I don't always use ``Show preview``, but I have used that option almost 50% of the time on articles.  I never even wanted to be an editor on WP, it happened ACCIDENTALLY.....because all the 4 articles (not many) that I created on WP were articles I thought would be there already.    And I was surprised they weren't.   So I felt compelled to create them.   Also, you notice that the number of articles I have edited on WP is only about 200 not even.      Cuz again, I'm more into QUALITY THAN QUANTITY.    And like everyone else on WP sometimes a person gets caught up.  If I WANTED to be a big shot on WP, with many created articles, and thousands of edited articles, I could....but I DO NOT WANT TO.       I don't really care that much.      But anyway, the point about ``Show preview`` I do use, and quite a bit....  I know it may not seem that way cuz of all the edits per page (in general), but I (especially the last 2 or 3 months) have utilized ``Show preview`` lots...  Your comment here presumptuously showed that you not only thought that I did not use ``Show preview`` ever, but also that I somehow was not even aware of it.   ???????

I joined CAP in 1986, served as both cadet and senior member, earned positions on squadron, group and wing staff and personally achieved both the Mitchell and Earhart awards. The ``personal comments`` you refer to belong to me, not . Perhaps the attempts by  to moderate your tone have failed because you think you are talking to only one person?  :Second, you are wrong because you have to resort to bragging about your status in order to prove yourself right. Attempting to throw your weight around in this kind of public forum, by declaring your years of service or current staff position, will result in multiple people laughing at you. Any further attempts at intimidation either by age or ``maturity`` will result in ongoing public mockery.   :Third, you are wrong because you can't read the comments embedded in the history of the document you are attempting to edit. You continuously attempt to ``correct`` an article that, while perhaps not completely correct, was not wrong. Linuxbeak has even gone so far as to incorporate some of your issues into the text of the article, as they do have some merit. However, that does not give you licence to continuously abuse, nor does it give you the right to crow about it.  :Fourth, you are wrong because you can't follow embedded links. Above, I linked to pages at CAP National Headquarters (http://level2.cap.gov/index.cfm?nodeID=5156), the United States Air Force (http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=163), and the United States Air Force Academy (http://academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/leadership_prep.php). All three links support the statement that the military considers the Mitchell Award and the Eagle Scout award equivalent for purposes of recruitment.  :Fifth, you are wrong because, beyond recruitment, the military does not care about Mitchell Awards, Spaatz Awards or Eagle Scouts. You can't wear any of them on a US military service uniform (and no, that does not include ROTC), no record of it is kept in your DD214, and no self-respecting soldier would continue to define themselves strictly based on an achievement made in high school.  :Finally, you are wrong because even you proved that you are wrong! Your original argument was that ``The Gen Spaatz Award is the equivalent of the Eagle Scout``. After pointing out that you were wrong, instead of admitting it and continuing a civil discussion as to why the Spaatz Award and Eagle Scout are comparable, you degenerated to bullying and confusing the issue by nitpicking. That the Army, Navy and Marine Corps will give a pay grade of E-2 to either a Mitchell Awardee or an Eagle Scout only further proves that your original statement is false and that, for those branches of the military, the Mitchell Award and Eagle Scout are exactly equivalent.  :If you really, truly want to keep embarassing yourself, perhaps you should dedicate a separate page to it.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",NckeBV

innocuous,"`    The reference to the DMSG, Deutsche Multiple Sklrose Gesselschaft, is problematic. It's a primary source. Is it independent? From what? Organizations form as patient organizations, often, but as they develop, they find sources of funding, often from drug companies, and can end up advocating the interests of drug companies instead of their original constituency. This is not any kind of charge against DMSG directly (maybe someone who can search German sources can tell us more), but such a source does not necessarily stack up well against standard secondary sources, and the Medline article is pretty good and balanced. The headline there is telling: ``Endovascular Treatment of Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Safe, May Provide Benefit in MS.`` Obviously, Dr. Jung was correct, such a claim is overstated, if taken as proven, the study was inadequate for that.  There are two parts to this article: the alleged syndrome and a proposed treatment which proceeds from the hypothesis regarding the syndrome. They are separate, and, to some extent, the article confuses them.  I can say this about DMSG and CCVI: if I had MS, or someone I loved had MS, I'd be very excited about CVVI and the implications. That is far from saying that I'd jump for invasive surgery, and caution is exactly appropriate. But having MS is no fun, either, and one would think that information about CCVI and the research going on with respect to it would be prominent on the DMSG home page. The link from the article does not go to a specific page about CCVI, it seems that it might be pointing to a video, but I can't see a translation of that. I was unable to find a page on the DMSG site that justifies the claim in the article. Accordingly, I'll be removing it.  However, I did find on the site a forum post that led me to this: [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180802.php Stanford University Halts CCSVI Treatments After Two Serious Incidents]. Cause for concern, of course. There is [http: //www.examiner.com/x-32750-Lima-Multiple-Sclerosis-Examiner~y2010m1d6-CCSVI-Stanford-University-and-the-University-of-Buffalo CCSVI, Stanford University, University of Buffalo and University of British Columbia], as well, about that Stanford report and more.  It's very important to distinguish between the syndrome hypothesis and any attempted treatment. The problem at Stanford has to do with treatment only.  There is a very clear report from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, dated Feb. 9, 2010.

innocuous,"`   After reviewing the article according to the Good Article Criteria, I have to decline the article's nomination for GA status at this time for concerns that are listed below. While reviewing, I also looked to for comparison the Eric Bana, Uma Thurman and Julia Stiles articles. I encourage the article's editors to look to those pages as examples and guides for what this article could become.  1. It is well written. - Pass * There were some minor copy edits that took the liberty of correcting but overall the article seems to pass this criteria with no glaring violation of WP:MOS. 2. It is factually accurate and verifiable. - Needs Improvement * There was some ``citation needed`` tags prior to the review that need to be cited.  * Considering the sensitive nature of BLP's, I would also look into citing some of the ``dating history`` with reliable sources. Some celebrities consider that information private and personal. Having that type of information attached to a strong reliable source would not only put that info in the clear but would also help curb the insertions of ``dubious former lovers`` into the paragraph.   3. It is broad in its coverage. - Needs Improvement *Outside of a brief mention of the ``dim pretty boys`` characterization, there is not really any coverage on Kutcher's acting reputation and how it is perceived by the critics and mainstream viewers alike. What is his acting style like? What do critics say are his strengths and weakness? What do movie studios or viewers think of his box office draw? Are there any director's quotes about working with him? 4. It follows the neutral point of view policy - Needs Improvement * I would rework the Selected Filmography section to be more comprehensive (looks like you're missing 5-7 projects). The very description ``selected`` is POV oriented in that it is using some unknown (and presumably un-objective) criteria for inclusion in the list.  5. It is stable - Pass * The article is a bit of a vandal target but the editors are prompt in maintaining the integrity of the article. Overall the article seems to have progressed gracefully in development. 6. It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic. - Needs Improvement * The article has images but part of the criteria is that the all the images included be properly tagged (Criteria 6a). Image:Welling and kutcher.jpg has a deletion notice due to improper sourcing.    I encourage the editors to consider renominating after the above concerns have been addressed.

innocuous,"` (UTC)  As far as Reputation goes I would agree that most SCA people don't care how they are perceived by reenactment groups and most also would not care if their combative techniques are seen as authentic or not. The focus of most of the fighters within the SCA is to win whatever tournament or SCA ``war`` they are going to next participate in and the authenticity of the techniques used would be considered irrelevant. There are a few people who fight at SCA practices or events however that are more interested in supplementing or further refining their martial arts skills such as some people involved in the FMA. If one reads FMA forums they will see evidence of this. Speaking for myself I fought for many years at SCA practices and events and never once cared if any of the technique I was using was authentic or not. In my opinion authentic technique is not necessarily more effective in actual combat. For example I once had to use an SCA ``Wrap`` strike against a much larger person who was trying to kill me at the time and despite what these so called reenactors are saying, the strike worked as intended. Members of the WMA seem to mainly advocate striking with the pommel or quillion of ones weapon in a close in fight. I don't agree that The WMA teachers advise is that good since striking at an opponent with a pommel or quillion is more likely to provide the person one is fighting with any easy opportunity to do a disarm since the back of most weapons is almost always the easier part of a weapon to grab and hold on to. I have also seen WMA groups sparring with their blunted steel weapons and found their strikes simply are not as vigorous as those typical of SCA rattan sparring. In my opinion sparring with blunted steel mainly takes away from simulating sword combat rather than adds to it simply because the blows are not delivered of a force that would have been used against armored opponents in real battles. I have seen one so called   arming sword tournament put on by the WMA and I did not find the fighting or weapon weights to be particularly authentic. Apparently the technique they had learned in the WMA groups was not that useful in their sparring since throughout their entire tournament I didn't see points being awarded for the use of authentic fighting technique even though they were trying to award points for doing so.  08:00, 7 March 2008`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",88oaEz

We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.     A few suggestions for what we should do with this article: *Change the infobox to Template:Infobox Writer *Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of ``Rand claimed to be a philosopher.`` *Do not refer to Objectivism as a philosophy; a term such as ``ideology`` would be more neutral. *Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.     Also, I'd like to point out this line from the article: :Rand viewed herself primarily as a novelist, not a philosopher     Response to Suggestions  There are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.  To begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).  In fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from ``dogmatic slumber.`` Philosophy has not been the same since.)  Further, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases.   In that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.  Ergo, ``ideology`` would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial ``Objectivism-as-cult`` smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus.   Oh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu). Othertimes, analytics would dismiss your average Continentalist as a ``philosoher-manque.``  Ayn Rand did not consider herself primarily a novelist. She explicitly addressed the issue of the novelist-philosopher distinction and with characteristic disdain: sneering at what she perceived to be the implication that one ruled the other out. She could not have been more univocal on the symbiotic connection she saw between the two. This is very serious indeed. AOluwatoyin`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",bCKr1T

The reason for this change is as historian Michael Berenbaum stated that Germany became a  ``a genocidal state``… ``Every arm of the country's sophisticated bureaucracy was involved in the killing process. Parish churches and the Interior Ministry supplied birth records showing who was Jewish; the Post Office delivered the deportation and denaturalization orders; the Finance Ministry confiscated Jewish property; German firms fired Jewish workers and disenfranchised Jewish stockholders.`` Also, in the book The Death Marches: The Final Phase of Nazi Genocide the author writes of numerous incidents where German civilians hunted down concentration camp inmates, or murdered groups of them as they passed through their villages in forced marches. In conclusion, the current statement is incomplete, only placing blame on the political establishment, ignoring the fact that significant elements of the German society supported such fanatical ideas.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",Tw9wfw

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors ``get it wrong`` is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.  Instead of ``truth``, Wikipedia aims for ``verifiability``.  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents ``THE TRUTH`` and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.  I have been trying to hit this NPOV ``sweet spot`` but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.    :Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits.

Johnuniq, my suggestion is to either provide a peer-reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article.   24.27 - I was referencing ``4.) observations of organisms being created;`` from above and am saying that anything that references the necessity of a deity is not allowed into science. Thus this cannot be a method of falsifiability.  We do not allow creationism into science, so why would we allow it as a method of falsifiability.  Thanks you for being open-minded enough to not just flame me.  HRAFN  the platypus is not a transitional species because it currently exists and little is known about the Australian fossil record. Do you have a peer-reviewed journal article backing your claim or are you also committing WP:SOAP WP:SYN??  Dave  I have never been called an original thinker as an insult before, so thanks. These, however, are not original thoughts  1. It is not original thought to check that a listed method of falsifiability falls under the definition of falsifiability. The definition of falsifiability is ``Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment.`` http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability.  A static fossil record is not an assertion that can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment. The fact that the record is not static is a fact that tends to support evolution, but not a method for falsifiability.  2. It is not an original thought that the idea of a deity is not allowed into science. Why would ``observations of organisms being created`` be listed as a method of falsifiability for a scientific theory when they require a deity?  3. The definition of falsifiability is ``Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment.`` http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability. If one of these ``true chimeras`` were to be found, it could still be hypothesized that they were two individual species living in symbiosis and that they evolved into what you see.  Since an observation of this kind would not prove evolution false, it is not a method for falsifiability.  4. ``A mechanism that would prevent mutations from accumulating`` is not a method of falsifiability because http://books.google.com/books?id=JjLWYKqehRsC&pg;=PA157&lpg;=%20PA157&dq;=Drosophila+Fruit+fly+mutations&source;=web&ots;=%20V5yPPBPE6h&sig;=fOkUS_qLsARelWNDqpe5uhq70mI&hl;=en shows that death is a mechanism to at least temporarily stop mutations from accumulating for an entire population, yet evolution has not been deemed false.    Dave, you may be right. These may be original thoughts, but if they are, then the science backing evolution is in a pathetic state and founded by scientists not smart enough to look at the definition of falsifiability. Or more likely I cannot find peer-reviewed journal articles making my claim because there are no peer-reviewed journal articles stating that these or valid methods of falsifiability in the first place. Thus, either provide a peer-reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",zVGKMm

The term is also found in Piers Anthony's Prosthy Plus, which may have been published as early as 1967 in Worlds of If, and as a novel in 1971 (but I only found the term in a 1986 reprint of the book copyrighted to 1973 so it's hard to say... However, it does seem that the term originated before Beter's mention of it in 1979 at least. Now it's just up to either Anthony or Lost in Space, I would say, although tracing back to robot may provide more clues as to robotoid's origin. - `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",fGs7R3

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  August 3, 2007  RESOLUTION  Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.  Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia';  Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;  Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other things, commits them to not `support claims to any part of the territory of the other party or claims for a change of their existing frontiers';  Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls `propaganda', including in school textbooks;  Whereas a television report in recent years showed students in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of FYROM;  Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy `General Mihailo Apostolski' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps showing that a `Greater Macedonia' extends many miles south into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in Bulgaria;  Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord's section `A', entitled `Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures', which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding `historic and cultural patrimony', the Government of FYROM recently renamed the capital city's international airport `Alexander the Great Airport';  Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM should abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage;  Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for `improving understanding and good neighbourly relations', as well as with European standards and values endorsed by European Union member-states; and  Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate  (1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to `promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility' and review the contents of textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools are stating accurate information; and  (2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",aV9uNH

I actually hate this song with a passion because I find it unbelievably trite, but it does have the interesting aspect that each phrase introducing a different solfege note (with a charitable eye) demonstrates a different musical mode.  Thus ``Me, a name I call myself`` arguably is in phrygian mode, for example.  What is also interesting is that Rogers and Hammerstein addressed the issue of musical tension between locrian mode (starting at Ti) and the root of the scale (at Do) with the lyrics: ``... which will bring us back to Do...``  Granted, as some people have observed above, it's not purely a ``white note`` song, but the teaching principle is definitely there and music teachers might exploit it to expose elements of theory.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",X7I2T7

It is simply meaningless to say ``the old definition is incorrect.``  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.   ::You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge ``creationist`` movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one ``argument`` they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, ``incorrect.``  ``See!`` they exclaim, ``even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!``  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |    :You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.   Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |    :The lead should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it could stand on its own as a concise version of the article..

innocuous,"`David Hines was responsible for the development of co-operatives in Tanganyika and Uganda, improving the living standards of farmers in their transition from subsistence farming to cash crops. In Uganda, some 500,000 farmers joined these co-operatives.  From 1947 to 1959 he was employed in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now Tanzania) by the British Colonial Office to develop farming co-operatives throughout Tanganyika. Previously, farmers had sold their produce to Indian traders at poor prices. The farmers gained more favourable prices for their crops by banding together and selling their produce in bulk.  In 1959, David Hines became Commissioner of Co-operatives for Uganda reporting to the Governor. He and his staff of 400 advised groups of about 100 to 150 farmers on how best to establish a co-operative, defining the constitution and accounting. At meetings, Hines, who spoke fluent Swahili, would listen to the farmers' problems and give speeches to encourage progress. With government money, the co-operatives built cotton ginneries, tobacco dryers and maize mills — and successfully exported coffee and cotton from this landlocked country. In the three years after independence, David Hines reported to the Uganda Government Minister Mr Ngobi. From 1966 to 1972 he advised the Kenya Minister of Agriculture particularly about the ``million-acre scheme`` to buy expatriate farms mostly in the Kenya highlands.  David Hines was born in Staffordshire, England on 8 February 1915. His parents lived in Margherita, Assam, India where his father managed coal mines. David's grandfather founded with his brother the Hines Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. After a childhood largely in Barnstaple and at Blundells School in Tiverton, both in Devon, David was articled to Cooper Brothers, the accountants, in London. In 1938 he sailed to Kenya to start work with accountants in Kisumu, only to find that his new firm had just been taken over by his old employers Cooper Brothers.  During the Second World War, David Hines served in northern Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Madagascar.   In the King's African Rifles, he commanded a squadron of 20 light armoured cars which was assigned the task of defending 800 miles of the northern border of Kenya against a possible Italian invasion from neighbouring Ethiopia. He spent six months eating with his African crews and sleeping under tarpaulins as there were no tents. The working language was Swahili.  At the Outspan Hotel in Kenya, his wife Bertha (Beb) Hines helped Lady Baden Powell reply to the thousands of letters sent to her on the death of her husband who had founded the worldwide scout movement.  In early 1941, Hines, then a captain was in the van of General Cunningham's swift 1900-mile advance from Kenya to Addis Ababa, via Kisimaio and Mogadishu in Somalia and up the one good road through Harar, Diredawa, and Awash. With iron rations while advancing in light armoured cars, they captured thousands of Italian troops. They confiscated their arms and many supplies, and left the prisoners for other troops who followed behind. In Addis Ababa, Hines helped rescue numerous Italians and Germans who had surrendered — he saw many others beside the roads who had been crucified by the local Shifta people.  On one occasion, while crossing the River Kolito in Eritrea, Hines witnessed one of the Leakey family (famous for anthropological discoveries in East Africa) win the Victoria Cross, the highest British medal for valour.   On another occasion, one night on the Eritrean border, an elephant lost a leg after walking on a landmine defending the camp.

Stirling, you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article.  Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks he's the next Salvador Dali.    Keith, er, I mean, User#24.168.66.27, I have my messages saved as text in a separate file, so if you delete my posts, then I will simply reinsert them.  You can't bury the truth.         The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:  If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.      It wasn't long ago that all references to ``Keith Wigdor`` were removed from this ``surrealism`` article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.     It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this ``surrealism`` article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.  For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",afaZmC

innocuous,"`  This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.  She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay.   Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.  I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?  She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story.  Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Jorge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka 'Restawhile'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.) I am pointing out the facts here.   She is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.  Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.  Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.  Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W. Cunningham and Jennifer J. Dickinson.   You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence.'  Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edits.    You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked. Blueboy96'   Did you look at Delicious Carbuncle and realize what this person is doing there?!  This edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time.  You have to know that I called up Mrs. Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop stalking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.  Please read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. She is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.  Who else would this be, instead of Pauline Berry, since only she knew at the time, that I actually called?!      * (hist) (diff) User talk:64.236.80.62‎ (Caution: Vandalism on Peaches Geldof.)

Her English is also giving her location away, not only the time zone she is most of the time editing.  She has this one on her welcome page, which is in my opinion slanderous.  She was just an actress.  This user has no particular interest in Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn memorabilia, or memorabilia collectors. Please be careful with your accusations.  This user is not Pauline Berry. Libel is bad!  This user is being defamed on websites and blogs by Mark Bellinghaus.   It is obvious and clear that it is Pauline Berry, she posted this weird message on her edits and now that is all gone. Here is the IP address for this woman, they might have two computers, but if there is a way for you to check the IP for Delicious Carbuncle, and this one, she could be exposed for the sock puppet that she is but denies.    We also believe that she is fooling people with her creation of Restawhile who tried to completely reedit the William Travilla page and we believe that there might be a chance that Greywitch, who created Joe Cotton's Wikipedia page is the same as Pauline Berry, since Cotton is a band member of the mermaids danceband.  And it would just be too much of a coincidence that Restawhile is finding Delicious Carbuncle, they welcome each other and give out those cookies, it is all just bad acting bs.    Pauline Berry's IP address is: 118.93.175.236 and I am 100% sure that it will also match Delicious Carbuncle.     `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",iHRHUe

The fact is that it is unrelated to bitcoin in the same way like a similar sentence would be unrelated to USD.    As such, it does not belong to the opening paragraph.    :I'm not sure where you get the idea that we can't mention controversial things in the opening paragraph. There are a massive array of reliable sources reporting on the subject of bitcoin speculation and price volatility, and it is trivial to demonstrate that there is far more trading of bitcoin on exchanges than there is use of bitcoin in consumer commerce. That a person who works for Moneero (a startup company involved in bitcoin wallet development) has a contrary view hardly refutes all of those mainstream sources.     ::Yes, there are sources mentioning bitcoin speculation and price volatility, but they contradict the Speculation article as I demonstrated, so either the sources on bitcoin are wrong, or the Speculation article is. ::Re ``it is trivial to demonstrate that there is far more trading of bitcoin on exchanges than there is use of bitcoin in consumer commerce`` - that, however, does not prove that the ones trading for bitcoin on exchanges ``attempt to profit from short or medium term fluctuations in the market value``. No ``trivial proof`` is of any worth to prove that. Actually, there is a proof that many bitcoin holders do not intend to sell their bitcoins on an exchange.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.  This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.  There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.  I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.  You, socialist-communists just keep dominating this article like it personally belongs to you. It doesn't. You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

They also didn't stop grenades being thrown trough the windows of trains taking people to attend a religious festival in the Irish Republic. I know this because the first happened to my uncle, the second to my grand-mother. When the civil rights movement started the British gave command of the army to the local anti-catholic bigoted government. Historically this should not surprise one, as following the 1798 rebellion the British government gave funding to the Orange Order a sectarian anti-catholic organisation [which had many similarities to the KKK]. I remember seeing a cartoon script used by this group which was titled “Pope Patrick” and was to promote their bigotry to the young. [One can see how “popetown” might not be in good taste given this context] Not to mention that the British outlawed the Catholic Church in Ireland, and a Catholic is still not able to become monarch, nor can the monarch marry a Catholic. So, while there have been improvements, such as the BBC not actually broadcasting this stupidity, bigotry is still enshrined in the system. While I am against a blanket sort of censorship, when a country such as Britain has ruled such a sectarian state, where its victims still live under some danger, it is important that they don't continue to fuel the sectarianism once used by them as a method to subjugate the majority of colonised locals, by organised bigoted surrogates and functionaries.

innocuous,"`   First of all, let me answer your tag, that is removed by me.  WP:Policy  Fairness of tone If we're going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone. Many articles end up as partisan commentary even while presenting both points of view. Even when a topic is presented in terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still radiate an implied stance through either selection of which facts to present, or more subtly their organization — for instance, refuting opposing views as one goes along makes them look a lot worse than collecting them in an opinions-of-opponents section.  We should, instead, write articles with the tone that all positions presented are at least plausible, bearing in mind the important qualification about extreme minority views. Let's present all significant, competing views sympathetically. We can write with the attitude that such-and-such is a good idea, except that, in the view of some detractors, the supporters of said view overlooked such-and-such a detail.    Now let me mention one thing to you;  If a name Khan was mentioned twice and you were having ````preservations`` against them.  You would have discussed it before, otherwsie you would have deleted Khan a single time. But you didn't done this, instead you deleted, edited and vandalised whole of the article, as usuall.

In fact it has been used by bands such as Savatage, Rhapsody of Fire and Symphony X are where that's coming from and where Nightwish, Epica, After Forever and many of the other bands are getting the sound from.

I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.   :CSD G10 does use the term ``negative in tone``, which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that ``biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone`` should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a ``porn actor`` is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a ``porn actor``, such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a ``porn actor`` is sufficiently ``controversial in tone`` to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.      Why has this valid article disappeared?  Please undelete it, and if you feel it is not up to Wikipedia standards, instead nominate it under WP:AfD, to give others a chance to comment on it and/or improve it.

innocuous,"No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.  The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.  But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance.   If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.  It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.  The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.  Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.  (1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.  (2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.  (3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.  (4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.  (5) Introducing matrix algebra.  (6) Quoting Feynam.  We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.  The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you.

Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se? *Why or what evidence is there to believe (outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added) that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do? *Why is Esoglou using this concept's article to ATTACK Greek theologians (John Romanides)? *Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead? Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation. *Why is it that it appears that Esoglou's edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article? *Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglou's best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church.  *Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY.. *Contrary to what Romanides said, it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all, even those who choose against him, such as the devil.  *Why is in Esoglou's POV interest to either make the article incoherent, discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale? *Why (if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage) it is not clear that Esoglou's behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by  show.  *Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglou's anecdotal original research?

This just pointing out ``facts`` and not in volition of WP:AGF in quoting that policy it says...  This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of malice. Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith.  So, any honest hearted admin, in light of the John Seigenthaler, Sr Debacle, will not surely not allow the kind of bias editing that now taking place.  So, in the mean time, and until there is some ruling tendered from higher athority, I will lovingly protect the Roskam article as   and  lovingly protect the Duckworth article from any, and all negative edits, even edits that are well cited, per wikipedia policy, I will do the same for the Roskam article.

This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:  1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.  2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.  3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.  Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.  Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page?

Wutz (1925). Apart from the Septuagint, transcriptions of Hebrew texts are contained in the writings of Flavius Josephus, Origenes, Eusebius, Epiphanes, Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion.

I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  ``Administrative geography`` certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what ``administrative geography`` addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled ``In the UK`` (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to ``contemporary administration`` or something that transitions from ``History``; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with ``Historically...``) to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of ``This structure`` in the History section (i.e., answer the question, ``What structure?``).  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms ``division[s]`` and ``subdivision[s]`` throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the ``Parliamentary representation`` section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",iP4iUO

So some practical guidelines have emerged independently on a number of articles.  *External links should go in the external links section. *External links shouldn't multiply beyond necessity (i.e., beyond the point necessary to clarify or minimally exemplify the content of the articlesany more and you get into web directory territory, and then everybody with a site to push says ``well, if site X is there, my site has a right to be there as well.``) *Sites linked to should preferably pass general Wikipedia notability guidelinesthat means wikilinks are preferred so there is at least a quality control process in place (look at, say Comparison of content management systems for a place where that idea has broken down, however). So a lot of what I do is pruning external links and redlinks from articles, looking for spam, SEO, self-promotion, registration-only sites that turn into sales pitches, disguised google ad sites, etc., sometimes very deviously salted among large lists of legitimate sites.

There is no reason whatsoever to put ``the late`` in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info: :*Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put ``the late`` in front of everyone that has died? :*Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put ``the late`` in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as ``the late`` in a print encyclopedia? :*Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as ``the late``?  Let's make things as static as possible. :*Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as ``The late Steve Irwin``, now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that. :*Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few ``the lates`` put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). ``Saving a click`` is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition. :*Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.  Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.

I have something to say about your edit, however, and I wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out.  The problem sort of exists with the original too, and i've been trying to think what we can do about it. See, a sizable chunk of people still do know it as 'the alien from alien', and our job is to correct those people when they look it up.  Its a problem with the article I was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled (if it went that way). The way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name, which is not ideal, but neither was the way I did it.  Basically it needs to say ``You might know this as alien, but you would be wrong``, but in wiki language. I've hit a brick wall with how to do that. I'm hoping you might have some ideas for that.

Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship. POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police.  I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views. Under ``conservative`` we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term ``fat cat`` means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid.

However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a ``musical scale.`` I played a standard guitar scale using alternating ``i`` and ``m`` fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a ``musical scale`` on several other orchestral instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, ``Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm.`` Well, I had two choices. One was to be the ``genuis of the guitar,`` to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for ``the door was open`` for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam), and the next week, I was able to play a ``musical scale.`` He smiled, and told me that I did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing:  The minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.``   You may also wish to look up Yepes's three-fingered scales/trills techniques  (www.blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=145762269&blogID;=376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented.   You may add your ``citation needed`` comments to call this into question, but it will not take away the facts of Yepes's achievements.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",1Xs6WU

After my last appeal was declined on 18/10/2010, I have become so desperate of Wikipedia, so I hadn't been checking my user account for few months and didn't notice I was unblocked only few days later.       Standing amongst a crowd demanding Mubarak's downfall, a man who commanded Egypt's Air Force against Israel, with occasional chanting of anti-Israel slogans, and overlooked by crewmen in the very same Patton tanks and M113 carriers the Egyptian army fought against, I couldn't help but feel history imposing its irony in the scene before me.  I guess I'm writing this here because given our knowledge of this region's recent history – however colliding our perspectives may be – I believed you'd be able to conjure the picture I was in and feel the same.    :I kind of share in your feeling, Sherif. I've got to add to the historical perspective Mubarak's injury in the attack on Anwar Sadat. I have also noted Stars of David drawn on abandoned police vehicles... Do you think the regime will fall? If so, will the successors maintain past agreements? JG, sorry for intrusion. -    ::No need to apologise Boris, you're always welcome on my page. Sherif, I agree that it is a bit surreal. I can only add that I hope that all works out for the best in Egypt and that there will be no more bloodshed. Hope all is well for you and your family. Best regards   :::Absolutely Boris. I'll head to your talk page I guess. :::It is quite surreal indeed, JG. Thank you for your words, I really appreciate it.        Cheers.   :email checked      Nice addition! Ha-Am (ve'Dod Shmuel) im Ha-Golan.       Add the cites, to the talkpage, it is one unnamed report imo       You may want to look at the RS:N for it/talk page which rejects that line of thinking. If you want to take it back to RS:N, go for it.              Best wishes.      That section is for uninvolved administrators.  Your commenting there is improper and disruptive.  Supreme Deliciousness said so, you re-posted there.  Any further edits in that section by you will result in a short block.  I am going to move your comments to the bottom of your main response comment.     :No problem George. All I ask is that you read the comments before moving them   ::I did read them, but that doesn't matter.  They absolutely do not belong in that section.      To bolster your argument .  Of course it is of major concern to most of us whether or not Hitler had Jewish roots. Was this edit during a topic ban?   It is more than a little offensive.    :Which edit are you referring to. Many of SupremeD's edits are over the top. Can you point to the specific diff please?    Sorry I thought I had.  His attempt to include the obscure and fringey theory that Hitler had Jewish genes in the main article on Hitler.  It just seems to Jewish me that he is trying to say ``Hitler``=``Jewish.``  This must be disconcerting to the Jewish editors in the I-P conflict area, as I see it is to you.     :::I agree that you shouldn't comment in that section. But the ineptitude of any admin to do what they volunteered to do makes me no care. You wouldn't have to comment there if they would read the diffs you provided in the first place. Hell, you even had to repeat your answer to the same question since they did not read through the conversation. Hey here is an idea for the AE admins: Don't try to judge conflicts for fun. Do it because you want to better the project. They can all rot if they want to play contrary games. Go to law school in your next life if you want to be a defense attorney. And don't cry about being a volunteer when you get off on it. I volunteer to play Mega Man but it does not mean I do not enjoy it.  :::Supreme Deliciousness is the problem just like Nableezy was. And both of them will come back sooner or later and make the topic area even worse. Tag teaming my ass. I have disagreed with you, JJG, enough times that the assertion is absurd. I do like you and agree with your POV, though. At least I can fully man up to that.   ::::You may want to bring up SD wp:forum shopping all over admins talk pages.      Hello. I recommend that you take the matter to AN/I or contact another administrator. I would take action myself, except my activity in Israel-Palestine matters makes me WP:INVOLVED. You can also e-mail  and ask them to permanently delete any edits that reveal confidential information. —  /  :I don't know what this section is about but good form on your part, MS. Thanks for being straight and admitting to being involved. Also, my bad bringing up the GA at AE. Kind of sullied it. And since this is JJG's page: What's up, badass? Hope all is well. Even with all this AE stuff you have turned out to be a perfectly fine editor. I do see your POV but you know that. As long as you keep it on the talk page then it is fine. At least you tried to get an article up to standard instead of focusing on junk. If you do get topic banned (I'm looking at one, too!) I say screw it. No indef (I assume) so we'll both be back and things will work out OK enough. Maybe neither of us will get topic banned but it is a reminder either way to be even more careful in the topic area. It is like pulling teeth but that is the price we pay for not being professional journalists or writers. And just to be honest: if this was an email it would be filled with cussing and even worse... but it isn't. Cheers, dude.   ::Thanks Malik and Cptnono. I appreciate your advice and support. This outing thing has got me really bumed out. I'm thinking of just retiring. It's really not worth all the aggravation. Whatever happens, Wikipedia has got to find a better way to deal with people who have no respect for the personal lives of others. It's quite sad.   :::You aren't going anywhere. Your feelings are too strong and you believe this medium can be skewed too much to allow you otherwise. Maybe you should go away. Take a break and not worry about it. And/or maybe you should alter your editing completely to make sure you are not put in this positions again. Whatever your decision is, SD and Nebleezy trying to out you further (you were already outed before) was bad form. Don;t resort tot that crap.

Even though your usual IPs are from Pittsburg and this last one was from Duke University, I can't help but see it as highly suspicious that yet another IP comes and suddenly gets interested precisely in the 3 articles in which, just days before, you started edit warring under the guise of various anonymous IPs.   Besides, I have already noted similarities in the behavior of this IP and yours (suddenly calling me a ``vandal`` without any justification, arguing that this is ``important`` while it is not...). So please, stop pretending.  If you're are accused (whether mistakenly or not) of a 3rd act of sockpuppetry, the only person to blame for this is you, and only you. You started to act under the guise of anonymous IPs, so don't complain if the other IPs that magically appear to support you (while they had never touched these articles before) are also suspected. Had you not used IP sockpuppetry twice, you wouldn't be suspected now.  You're also not in position of accusing me of anything, since the previous 2 IPs you used can unmistakenly be linked to your account. So don't draw unnecessary attention on your case. I'm not sure the admin board will be happy to see how you've already commited 2 acts of sockpuppetry that are certains.

So please stop trying to frighten me, and face the consequences of your acts. You've already used twice a form of sockpuppetry, don't try saying you're going to accuse me for stating it, it's only making me laugh.  So don't talk of ``NPA`` and don't even try to argue that it would be an ``insult`` to say that you would go to such length to ``pretend``. Because you've already pretended twice before.  For the rest, I've got nothing to add besides what I've written yesterday. You made these edits under the guise of anonymous IPs only to take your revenge for our previous quarrels. I cannot see how they could be constructive in anyway. The nature itself of your edits is illegal, since you did them using a form of sockpuppetry, which is not tolerated on WP. That's why they were reverted in the first place.  And then, I cannot see what would be the use of these edits, because first they're all unsourced, and then, they have no use, no importance, no encyclopedical relevance, they were only made in a revenge attempt. And finally, please have the decency to stop talking about ``consensus``, because first you have always ignored them (I remind you everyone was against your fansub edits, you did them nonetheless), so reading ``consensus`` in one of your post will always make me laugh. And second, I don't think we can talk about ``consensus`` when the the only people that support you are yourself and your own sockpuppets.   So, just get over it. This is over. Don't try to take your revenge, it's useless, and you'll be the only one hurt in the process.  You have now commited enough policy violations, if we add sockpuppetry to your constant edit wars and disruptions of Wikipedia (and now, the fact that you try to alter and modify people's comment in your favor). In your own interest, you should stop that, because the only one who will be blocked will be you.  (UTC`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",lo8I6R

Ayyavazhi is not notable enough to be mentioned there and in a number of places. It is the same as including Ayyavazhi in the Menstrual cycle article (see ). There is nothing wrong creating dozens of Ayyavazhi articles, but it is wrong creating links from every possible location on WP. -    = When you have      * 13.1 Buddhism on menstruation     * 13.2 Christianity on menstruation     * 13.3 Hinduism on menstruation     * 13.4 Islam on menstruation     * 13.5 Judaism on menstruation     * 13.6 Sikhism on menstruation     * 13.7 Tribal societies and menstruation     * 13.8 Mysticism  What is wrong in Having Ayyavazhi on Menstraution  Please note that I am not a follower of that religion, but I feel that we don't have any right to deny an existence of a religion.

I want a discussion and not argument    Similarly, I feel that it should be included in the list of religions also    :Hi! All the religions you mention about are a million times more notable than Ayyavazhi. Ayyavazhi is not even a recognised religion in India. Wikipedia has a Notability guideline which prevents us from doing precicely this. There a literally thousands of minor religions in this world, and all of them probably have an opinion on menstruation. What will happen if all these thousands of religions want mention in that article? We are compiling an encyclopedia, not a world fact book.Tribal societies and mysticism are generalised sections in that article which give an overview of the practices. Ayyavazhi with its miniscule followers does not belong in that article. -    = When you are mentioning ``In Kumaon region of Uttranchal`` in the page of Duryodhana and not limiting to mention Duryodhana in Kumaon (for example), I think the same logic should be followed for Ayyavazhi also  Again this is MY opinion and I would like to see a consensus   Please correct me if I am wrong. I want a discussion and not an argument The following copied from  -   = With reference to your comment on my talk page that ``Ayyavazhi is not even a recognised religion in India``,  Sorry for my ignorance. What is a ``recognised religion`` in India  By the way, my district collector (meaning State Govt) declares an holiday on one of their festivals    Any how, my simple question is that ``Just because we are not aware of something, it is justified that we oppose articles about it in Wikipedia``  Again this is MY opinion and I would like to see a consensus    I suppose the census data is one of the things that distinguish a 'recognised' relegion. This page contains the data from the 2001 census and a spreadsheet which contains state-wise data. The data from Tamil Nadu has the number of Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Budhists, Others and Relegion not stated. There are 54985079 Hindus, 7252 'others' and 59344 who have not stated their relegion. Obviously, the government has not counted Ayyavazhi as a seperate relegion.        The government in 2001 may not have counted Ayyavazhi as a seperate religion. But the same government declares an occasion as Gazetted Holiday in 2006 (for the first time). Does it tell you something. If there is a change in 2006, why not we accept that    ::When did TN government's vote grabbing attempts become equivalant to official recognition?! BTW the holiday was declared in a couple of districts of TN, and not for whole state. Does this make Ayyavazhi notable enough to include in a encyclopediaic summary article of a bodily function? I don't think so -    :::To answer your question ``If we are not aware of something, does it justify opposing it?`` - Of course it does. That is how WP evolves - through negotiations and challenges and verifiability. If the subject is proven to be verifiable then it is allowed to exist by the community. Ayyavazhi in my opinion has utterly failed in the notability and verifiability criteria. Going by your argument anyone can create any article on any subject and use your argument to justify its existence. It will totally undermine WP's reliability as a source. -     :::I think you have totally misunderstood my reply.  I said WP evolves and grows based on challenges and skepticism by the WP community. We don't (shouldn't) anything at face value. The most imortant criteria in Wikipedia is its Verifiability. For example, if I create an article on, say, a species of three eyed monkey, and base the article solely on my having seen the monkey, it will be challenged and deleted from WP. Notability and verifiability demands that any subject documented should be (a) verifiable - ie should be independently documented from a neutral point of view by a reliable third party, meaning I can't one of my friends to create a website on the three-eyed monkey and cite that website as reference in my WP article, and (b) Notable - ie should be relatively well know beyond a select group of people. In this example, I can't claim notability for the three-eyed monkey just because myself and a friend of mine have seen it.  :::If an article is questioned based on the notability and verifiability criteria, it is not because the article is untrue, but it just means it is not a suitable WP article. An encyclopedia does not contain unverified information, nor does it contain original research.  :::I am not familiar with your problems with the article Medical School but it does show that WP works. There is a conversation happening and a compromise will be reached.  :::Coming to the Ayyavazhi issue, I have nothing against the faith itself or its followers. My only issue was the way  had inserted Ayyavazhi is places it does not belong. There is no reason an obscure faith such as Ayyavazhi should be listed on par with the world's major religions. :::- See this discussion. The same user had gone and  created hundreds of links on pages with no apparent connection with Ayyavazhi. The List of religions page perhaps warrents a mention os Ayyavazhi, that is why I agreed to leave it there. But See  and  and even the . I think this is a blatent attempts of evangelical zeal that does not have a place in WP -    ::::What I meant by When did TN government's vote grabbing attempts become equivalant to official recognition? was was this the first time TN government try to get the votes of a minority group. Obviously there are quite a few followers of Ayyavazhi in the districts mentioned, although they may think themselves as non-hindus. Declaring a holiday IMO is a way of pandering to this group. -    :::::Let's not go into all that. Yes, Ayyavazhi merits a place in List of Religions, but not in summary articles like Menstrual Cycle etc., at least not yet. Let us try to add valid references from among those suggested by Vaikunda Raja at Talk:History of Tamil Nadu.

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.  Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under ``Ed O'Loughlin`` but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.  This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies.

For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14``, “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14``, “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14``, “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14``, “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.  Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such.   Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete ``when in doubt don't delete`` and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

I’ve said it before, I say it again: This article is perverting Forstall. The three gentlemen had a noble cause. “Why lists of major urban areas vary so greatly.” Then they made a mistake, made their own list. And before you know it, it gets a Wikipedia article titled List of metropolitan areas by population . This title is disingenuous. It tricks people into thinking that this is what it appears to be, a list of metropolitan areas by population. People are being fooled so much that they endlessly attempt to update a list that shouldn’t be updated.  Forstall et al may be worth to be treated as an artifact of history. If possible, the list should be edit blocked. But the title must reflect what it is: List of metropolitan areas by population according to Forstall, Greene, and Pick. It is definitely not a  List of metropolitan areas by population.  Everything else is just wrong. It is also interesting that Wikipedia’s trite and true “consensus” is being invoked with nary a word on the discussion page.

innocuous,"` For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the ``Kumite`` tournament.  Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.  Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest ``kick with a knockout`` at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just ``jump into`` such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.  The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.  He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie ``The Quest``, and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.  In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk)       * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: ``Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true.`` I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did.

New York Times (+ International Herald Tribune)?   : Except for Reuters, AP has no real English-language competition; the other services you name dominate in other languages. I know of no American papers that subscribe solely to the NYTimes and/or Washington Post News services without also subscribing to AP. AP is cheaper and far broader as far as breaking news goes.    To a Minister of Truth: I suggest Brass Check is a good book for the state of the AP at the turn of the century - there's more to it than Teletypes, after all. And if AP again has a monopoly on wire-servicing (in the animal-husbandry sense) the US public [just how is the UPI comment to be interpreted?], how that has played out in the past ought to be of interest. Especially since the AP is the sole collator of ``election`` ``results`` tomorrow. And if you protest Brass Check is not about the AP, I'll point out the older Library of Congress catalogue entries list ``Associated Press`` as one of its categories.  00:52, 2004 Nov 2 (UTC) (PS: count y'self lucky I merely mentioned the book, and didn't start rewriting the article.)  : There are many, many books about the history of U.S. journalism that contain information about AP which might be of interest to this article, but ``Brass Check`` isn't one of them. It is wildly out of date (especially if you think it has relevance to the current situation; when it was written, AP was a struggling underdog). But of course you are welcome to start rewriting the article - that's the way Wikipedia works! -    :: So put some of THOSE books in, fer cryin out loud. (wait. what? How can what is for years an indebted monopoly spreading completely inverted or entirely fabricated news with impunity qualify as ``struggling underdog``?) Incidentally, check history (unless WP has discarded it for lack of space)  I am not welcome, even when what I write is well-supported. As a for instance: Nurse Nayirah. (I do not contest that this is because of a certain immoderateness in my writing: after the outrage I've watched go on just the past four years - thanks in part to a US press that, in what counts, lies and covers up as baldly as Sinclair described 85 years ago - I cannot be moderate. If there were moderates taking my place I'd be happy; but so many waste themselves on absolute bread-and-circus garbage like American Idle.) I limit login now to when I express something that's only my opinion.  23:13, 2004 Nov 2 (UTC)  ::Oh, I forgot to mention: someone thinks Brass Check interesting enough that the U of Illinois Press reprinted it about two years ago (ISBN 0252071107)  02:51, 2004 Nov 3 (UTC)  AP's television service is now known as APTN  Note: The picture on the main entry page shows the AP's old headquarters in Rockefeller Center. The company has since moved to Manhattan's West Side.     If we're going to list every retracted story that AP, or any other wire service, has run over the years, we're going to have to double the size of wikipedia! So I removed the long, rambling account of one such case, since it lacked context. Discussion about the merits, or lack thereof, of the wire service are certainly valuable additions to the article, but not in the form of a rant. -      This was originally posted on the Reference Desk with the title ``Is news public domain?``  It seems from the public domain article that facts are in the public domain, but reporting of them may not be.  A news agency might do a lot of work to collect some news and expect just compensation.  So how is it that news stories can be ``picked up`` by competing agencies, e.g., the Associated Press picking up a story in a local newspaper?  Isn't that local news story under copyright?  Is there a fee involved or some sort of professional agreement?  Thanks.  15:10, 2004 Nov 16 (UTC) :As you can see from the article on the AP, it's owned by its contributing newspapers.  A local newspaper allows its stories to be used by the AP because it has the opportunity to use AP wire stories itself.  So, the answer is that the news story is certainly under copyright, and the only fees/professional arrangements involved are the money and agreements necessary to maintain the AP. -) [[User:Jwrosenzweig|Jwrosen",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",wmKFcC

It is plausible that a lethal stun gun could be constructed from a very large capacitor charged by a high-voltage DC source. However, the flash units in the ``disposable cameras`` used are much the same as non-disposable cameras: battery to provide source power at low voltage, circuitry to boost the voltage, capacitor (limited physical size) to store the energy for quick release, and strobe to create the light. Cameras powered by 2 3V CR123A used to be common before rechargeables took over, and there is at least one commercial stun gun powered by the same combination.

innocuous,"` ::The last part of your reasoning, ``potentially ambiguous for non-native speakers from countries which use the long scale``, may be suited for a discussion at WT:DATE, but for articles like this one, MOS:TIES overrides that concern. Speaking of discussions at WT:DATE, it looks like the most recent on the subject was ``Short scale billion``, which you actually initiated! Although a clear consensus wasn't established, it is evident from those interpreting MOS:NUMERAL that it was suggesting the use of billion as a widespread replacement for thousand million, whether or not the editors in that discussion agreed with it or not. So the interpretation that billion is being recommended by the guideline seems pretty clear from both sides of the argument. One point made by  that I'd like to reiterate is that the British English style guides listed here recommend the use of the short scale. Also interesting to note is that the PDF you linked to above actually acknowledges that the short scale billion is used internationally – further reason for us not to worry about its perceived meaning. I'm not challenging the fact that there are still some in the UK that may take pause at the sight of the word billion, but we would need some evidence that this is a significant concern that applies to a significant amount of the population. So far, that's only a theoretical notion. I can't imagine that someone reading Wikipedia doesn't read or listen to UK media, which overwhelmingly transitioned to the short scale by the early 1980s. Taking pause and being confused are two very different things, and in the context of a film, I doubt anyone would think for a second that the movie made a trillion; context matters.    `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",7Z96Y0

Can't we have Nastika redirect to Astika, just as nonflammable redirects to flammable ? * Is there a reason to comment out the references (footnotes), or is that an oversight ? * Giving only the literal meaning of nastika as ``non-pious`` is perhaps misleading, since when used in the technical philosophical sense it surely does not imply that Buddhists/Jains/Carvakas are non-pious (although that presumably was how the initial link arose)! To give an analogy Hasidic also literally means ``pious`` but it would still be wrong to equate astika and hasidic, since their usage clearly goes beyond the literal meaning (although isn't the similarity remarkable! -) ) Hope these points are helpful.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",QClZNT

I'm sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator (Ragib) on Wikipedia!

February he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses & barn, feedg. ye cattle &c; that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that & bore it well.`` - Paraphrase. ::*A3b  Would Gage's mental impairment belong here?

This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important.   *A5 Other matters ::*A5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well- mostly avoided by the article. Instead of proper detailing of the injury and Gage's role in history.  ::*A5b Only a few hundred words on Gage's mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used. ::*A5c Using ``passim`` and other issues in citing Macmillan is also a cop-out and would merit a verifiability failure. ::*A5d Not even that, it doesn't even credit Macmillan when it should.  *A6 Notes ::*A6a A substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes.

innocuous,"`     For what it's worth, I recently made this animation explaining cosine and sine in terms of the unit circle. Please, read the image's description on the image's page (just click the image) before making any remarks.  This is the only representation of both functions and their relation to the unit circle I could figure out that would:  1. Show the graph of both sin(θ) and cos(θ) in the usual orientation, where the horizontal axis represents θ and the vertical the value of the function.  2. The graphs shown, when animated, would not be drawn inverted when θ increases (the point in the unit circle moves counter-clockwise, as usual).  The ``bent`` way I used to represent cosine was necessary in order to have the graph y = cos(θ) in the usual orientation, condition 1 above, otherwise it would have to be vertical, and users would have to ``tilt their heads`` in order to see the graph properly. This not only would be very lazy, but it would be a terrible idea because:  * There would be a huge, empty square between both graphs. The animation frame would be too large, and mostly empty space. This space would not be useful for anything else that wouldn't be conveyed better in the accompanying article or image description.  * There would be no way to compare both graphs at once.  Therefore, his odd format is justified. Notice that this bend could be done either to the left or to the right. However, if to the right, the graphs would be drawn backwards in the animation, as they would be drawn from the left, and not to the right, as it is currently. This breaks condition 2, mentioned earlier.  I'm not sure if everyone would be OK with including this animation in the article. I couldn't figure where to place it anyway. So, for now, I'm just letting you guys know this animation exists. Cheers! —  |  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",XUSbay

innocuous,"`  *Also, this is the current religion section that I'd like to check with other users to reach consensus. What do you guys think?:  A 2012 national telephone survey in English of a sample of 400 Iranian-Americans, commissioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans and conducted by Zogby Research Services, asked the respondents what their religions were.  The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, ``No response``: 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and ``Other``: 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.  Due to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.  There are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",2V1d7W

Othu (Spiritual hymns): This class of Namboothiris was basically teachers of Othu (Vedam).  6. Saanthi (temple priesthood): These Namboothiris are priests in temples.  7. Adukkala  These Namboothiri families were specialists in large-scale cooking and catering.  8. Arangu (stage): This special group of Namboothiris, called Chaathira Namboothiris, was a military group.

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.        The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.                                   History The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.                         Proper History As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",T8aieB

innocuous,"`  Dear Sir:   Wikipedia's rules for ``protecting`` a page do not make a provision for using the tool on an editor's talk page, especially when the ``protect`` is used as an added punishment.  One must wonder at the complete lack of moral fiber displayed when an administrator improperly utilizes a ``protect`` on an editor's talk page, after repeat after, said editor had been blocked from further editing.  This violation of wikipedia's rules was further compounded by the administrator's failure to withdraw the ``protection`` for nearly 24 hours after the block itself was removed.  In an attempt to cover up this ``error`` the same administrator added the comments that he was removing the block, when in fact, he was actually removing the ``protection.``  This gives rise to the notion that administrators who violate wikipedia rules are immune to sanction by their peers.  This safe harbor must give the vengeful administrator the feeling of  great power.  Sad, true, and very funny.

I question its utility, and argument that the article reads much, much better without it. In the meanwhile, another, anonymous, user has re-inserted all the cruft because ``people don't know what a lacrimal fossa is``. I'll point out that I myself did not know what a lacrimal fossa was until a little while ago. I followed the wikilink (something anybody without severe arthritis can easily do), and I now know. This is not a paper encyclopedia but, most of all, it is not a collection of essays: the articles are not self-contained entities, and the explanation of everything is a click away. People have to get used to this; not linking lacrimal fossa is a crime. Putting a cranked, short explanation of it in the text of an article that has nothing to do with physiology is, well, pedantic, annoying cruft and confusing to both subjects. Then there is the matter of etymology. Yes, every scientific name is in Latin (which makes it quite silly to say anything ``comes from Latin``: it never left Latin to go anywhere else), and scientists have to pull something out of their arse every time they name a new species. However, people reading about an alleged simian species would hardly be interested in a pedantic, detailed decomposition of each word of the name; also, technically speaking,  Pseudopotto martini does not mean anything but this particular alleged species of tarsier.

innocuous,"`Actually to clarify....after Bret Hart was forced to vacate the world title(and retire) due to a concussion, the planned Hart vs Sid Vicious title match was changed less than 48 hours before the match to Sid vs Benoit. Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit ``won`` the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was ``Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest``. End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit ``won`` the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his ``pinning the wrong Harris``. Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........  Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point? That's just stupid.   The Sandman won the ECW Championship FIVE times, not one as the article shows!   Where did it go?  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",TpEm9U

He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count ``are you 5?`` in that, OK, I admit that one).    The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling  this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now ``working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program``.  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.  The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that  and  were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When  was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that  was up to no good.  Had  not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.  I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that  and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).  If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.  If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward  and .  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.  I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.

The second one should refer to the ``Alpha Ethniki`` period 1959-2006 and the third one to the Superleague 2006 - .... Of course the second and third could be incorporated into one article since Alpha Ethniki and Superleague are similar.

My point is that objective or not, fair or not, truthful or not, this mediation imho will not solve the issue.

I saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?  I have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say ``This article written by .....`` and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.  I saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.  As I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you ``scaring them off``, as you put it.    I don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.  It's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.  So goodbye.

innocuous,"` :::The COI tag, like most others, is a form of clean up notification. It's supposed to indicate that an article was authored by, or underwent a major edit by a conflicting party to other editors, who may then neutralise the content. It is not supposed to have full-time residence on the article once clean up has been performed and the editor/s with any COI cease to disruptively affect the neutrality of the article (which should really be brought to admin attention, not via a tag). Keeping it once the article has been made neutral is misleading and also makes Wiki articles ``ugly``. There are thousands of articles on Wiki where the original author was closely-related to the content. Once an uninvolved editor steps in and makes the tone/content neutral the tag is no longer valid. Its purpose is to serve as a warning that the content may not be neutral to other editors. Given than a lot of editors have since taken control of the matter here, and are enforcing measures to prevent Dom and those closely related to Davina from introducing puffery, peacocking and any other bollocks, there isn't really any need to ``warn`` anyone that the content may be untrue. I'm sure if or when Davina's meatpuppet ``fans`` make edits they are quickly spotted, verified and removed if unsupported. As such, I recommend removing the tag, in due course, once the minor disputes are settled. Tags are aids for editors to develop the article as fore mentioned, they should not be used in the spirit of a warning system to general readers.  [ • RFF] `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",WqSig5

innocuous,"`   This is inresponse to a cowardly ``unsigned`` who suggested that Thomas Alva was a pedophile. The entire section was deleted. I think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in Edison's life. ``Isn't the U.S. age of consent 18?``-(as ``unsigned`` stated).  Hey IDIOT, this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw ``young love`` as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century America. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters ``married off`` as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get ``radical`` ideas of ``independence`` floating in their heads.) Not like the ``mail-order brides`` of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female ESPECIALLY is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. ``Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?`` You should also study more about Edison's life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that Edison's second marriage was more a ``politcal`` arrangement than anything else, as little Mina was a neice of Thomas Alva's principal enemy and competitor JUPITER PIERPONT MORGAN. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic ``investment`` on Morgan's part to overtake Edison' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that Morgan a a ROBBER BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call Alva Edison a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) Veryverser  Following this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his ``genelogical study`` of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that Edison lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with...   We are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. ``women's liberation``, all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in North America by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's ``middle-class`` strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as ``respectable`` society``. This all seemed to chagge in America after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite ``cultural shift``, throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. Edison's age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of Asia and Europe today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the States, various wealthly and powerful men, among them old Hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-brides(Woody Allen, Rupert Murdock as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, ORIENTAL WOMEN, rather than western ones for their ``sunset years``). In Alva Edison's case, this was sort of a ``wirlwind romance`` manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at Edison and control of his company. Think Napolean Bonafart's divorce of Josephine to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a ``political`` union.

I also believe in this, but the way articles are written here (even article on Khatris) with mention of  mixed caste of low-ritual status, born of the union of Kshatriya mothers and Shudra fathers,  mixed pratiloma caste of low ritual status, but he suggested that Khatris could be a mixed caste born of Kshatriya fathers and Brahmin mothers Are we animals??? where we are suggesting hybrids and so on. We are humans, such lines should not have been used in any of these article at first place, as these lines narrating that we get lower quality of human beings if one go out of their caste, is ridiculous, and is provoking for any community. There is no scientific basis of it. And to be honest, i see a racist in you as well, who is classifying people as trading class or schedule class or Rajputs or kshatriya (and then asking for references). A new born has no caste, he/she believes in what he/she is told to believe. And caste is nothing on which anyone should feel proud or shamed, as he has not decided it for himself.

innocuous,"`  :I can think of several citations for the Personality section, most of them quotes by Jafar himself. I shall list them below.  Jafar is portrayed as a megalomaniac (Jafar himself crows ``The power, the absolute POWER!``) who will not hesitate to destroy anyone he perceives as a threat to his own sinister designs (``I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abubu``). He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (``You are most gracious my liege`` - ``I assure you your highness, it won't happen again``), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, Jafar's villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where Jafar displays no remorse in sending Gazim the Thief to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that ``Gazim was obviously less than worthy`` in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song ``Humiliate the Boy`` also establishes Jafar as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing ``another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one`` and treating the Genie in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which Jafar viciously tugs the genie's beard several times whilst shouting orders like ``Do as I say``). It is not until Jafar gains control of the Genie's lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (``Don't talk back to me you big blue lout! You are to do what I order you to do! Slave). It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure.  Jafar is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and plucky (giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence, a trait not often seen in Disney villains), even in his times of evil and cunning, proclaiming ``Ewww...`` when contemplating decapitation. This, however, doesn't keep Jafar from having a sub-par sense of humor himself, spurting several puns in a row while keeping Aladdin and his friends from getting the lamp during the film's climax (``Your time is up!``, ``Don't toy with me!``, ``Things are unraveling fast now, boy!``, ``Get the point?``, ``I'm just getting warmed up!``) This comical humor does not carry over in the film's direct-to-video sequel, which aimed to make Jafar more sinister and ruthless, though it is referenced in Jafar's role in ``Hercules and the Arabian Night``.

innocuous,"`  Saved for posterity:    There has been a long-standing issue with Irvine22, primarily on the PIRA page, but also on others.  Irvine22 has been confirmed as a puppetmaster for the purposes of block evasion, refused to acknowledge or apologize for the incident, and then began to implement a series of disruptive, POV edits without discussing the matter on the talk page.  His edits have been almost universally reverted, and yet he continues to make them, after being told many times by many editors as well as one admin to raise issues on the talk page first.  He shows no sign of ceasing this behaviour, nor will he acknowledge, much less address, any criticism of it.  The page's resident admin, , suggested that I raise the matter on the ANI page if it continued, so that is what I am doing now.  Following is a small sampling of Irvine22's more recent edits.  Note that I have only selected edits for which there was no consensus, that were later reverted.  These also all occurred after his block and subsequent sockpuppetry.  They also occurred after he was repeatedly told not to edit the article without first seeking consensus, or at the very least providing an adequate source.    The edits:    This edit was reverted, and a new section started on the talk page.  Instead of trying to reach a consensus, he restored the edit with the explanation ``per discussion``.  It was not.     This POV edit was reverted.  Irvine22 restored it.  It was reverted again.  So he restored it again.  It was reverted again and he was told to bring the matter up on the talk page.  So he restored it again.  And again.  And again.  Actually a quick glance at the page's history will show you the behaviour he regularly partakes in. I really wish I could link to more, but I simply don't have the time.  Rest assured, there are dozens.   Talk page disruption begins here  Irvine22 has also been dismissive of advice and instructions to change his editing habits, as can be seen here, and especially on the PIRA talk page, beginning here.  Note Irvine22's polite yet dismissive tone throughout all of this.  He is almost pathologically incapable of acknowledging any wrongdoing on his part, or criticism of his actions.  I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to game, or the result of some actual personality disorder for which he cannot be fully faulted.   I haven't the time to go digging through his edit history.  I really wish I did.  I will, however, link to this page on the PIRA talk page and invite further comments from the editors there.

If ``turn of the century`` is ambiguous in a particular context (and I think we can agree that ``turn of the nth century`` is also ambiguous), then perhaps in most cases ``the start of the nth century`` would be a better form of words. ``Turn of the 19th to 20th century`` is ugly and I've never heard it used; please let's avoid it.

The mid-1980s represented their [avoid ``their``, very amateurish] most recent period of success, with two league victories, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup—their first continental trophy. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.  The club's home colours have traditionally been blue and white, [Everton have played in many colours] and [avoid ``and's``, very amateurish] numerous well-known footballers have donned the Everton shirt: the most notable is Dixie Dean, [use correct name, William Dean - he hated Dixie] who scored a record 60 league goals in the 1927–28 season.

The club have a large fanbase and regularly attracts high attendances, averaging over 36,000, 90% of stadium capacity.[2] Everton have a notable rivalry with neighbours Liverpool F.C. and matches between the two sides are known as the Merseyside Derby. Liverpool F.C. were formed in 1892 by a breakaway group consisting of Everton's former president and several players. The dispute also resulted in Everton leaving Anfield, their original home ground.

From memory, the debate ended with Dublin getting it's 1.2 million restored on the basis that a local authority administrative area doesn't necessarily define the population of a town/city when the commonly accepted boundaries are very different.

Instead of immediately accusing you of wrongdoing, Mackan79 looked further into your and Tewfik's edit histories. Based on that review, he seemed to think that there was something more to that original anomaly, and he articulated his concerns in toto. You may have been offended by the length of the presentation because it seemed to imply your guilt, but I believe that Mackan79 ws just trying to be thorough and not make accusations without foundation.

Piped links that go to unexpected pages (someone clicking ``Suetonius`` expects a link to the person, not to a random one of the books he wrote (I realize that it's the only extant one, but it's still random and arbitrary from an objective perspective)!) are strongly discouraged because of the circuitous and confusing path they give to our readers, and the information they coyly hide (i.e. that the book of Suetonius' being referenced is Lives of the Twelve Caesars) from anyone who doesn't take the time to click the link and read the whole page provided.

Web. . While Wikipedia's editor gender gap is important but difficult to measure, its biographical gender gap can more readily be measured. We correlate a Wikipedia-derived gender inequality indicator (WIGI), with four widespread gender inequality indices in use today (GDI, GEI, GGGI, and SIGI). Analysing their methodologies and correlations to Wikipedia, we find evidence that Wikipedia's bias in biographical coverage is related to the gender bias in positions of social power.  *Kalla, Joshua L., and Peter M. Aronow. ``Editorial Bias in Crowd-Sourced Political Information.`` PLOS ONE PLoS ONE 10.9 (2015): n. pag. Web. . In this paper, we examine what kinds of biases exist in crowd-sourced information on Wikipedia. Because any user can also be an editor, no one person with any particular ideological or partisan motivation should be able to control Wikipedia. Yet scholars have recognized the tension that comes from distributed, crowd-sourced platforms like Wikipedia. On the one hand, crowd-sourced information platforms create opportunities for citizens to challenge media-driven narratives. On the other, these platforms may be captured by the self-interested who have the greatest motivation to shape them for their own benefit.    * Many hands make Wikipedia work. (2015, December 10).

The National Retrieved from http://ezproxy.sfpl.org/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1515588882?accountid=35117 Prof Bruckner's hope is that having systemic data on the extent and reasons behind bias could mobilise resources to deal with the issue. It might help, she suggests, if universities encouraged staff to become Wikipedia contributors, ensuring important academic work does not get ignored. They could, for example, expand the programmes some of them already run for academics on writing newspaper editorial columns - another area where female writers tend to be heavily outnumbered - to cover Wikipedia contributions. ``That is not something we usually do. We're scientists, we're not in the business of marketing our research. We have no training to do this,`` said Prof Bruckner. She admits she has never contributed to Wikipedia herself. The apparent bias could also be partly redressed by focusing on general initiatives to improve Wikipedia's quality. For Prof Bruckner, the Wikipedia project may also offer pointers about how the value of academic work in general is assessed. ``There is the gender issue, but also how people think about scholarship and what's reputable scholarship or not,`` she said.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",U3vW8K

For its supporters, the Sardar Sarovar dam and the multi-dam Narmada Valley Development Project of which it is a key component are intended to increase power capacity and provide irrigation, cleaner drinking water, and flood control; for its opponents, the dam is environmentally and socially disastrous and is purchased at the cost of submerging a high percentage of dalit and adivasi villages. The wealthy BAPS organization is criticized by dam opponents for acting to protect its class interests, including those of its land holding members.

Defecation may be involuntary or under voluntary control. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once this has been achieved, loss of control causing fecal incontinence may be caused by physical injury (such as damage to the anal sphincter that may result from an episiotomy), intense fright, excessive pressure placed upon the abdomen, inflammatory bowel disease, impaired water absorption in the colon (see diarrhea), and psychological or neurological factors.  The loss of voluntary control of defecation is experienced frequently by those undergoing a terminal illness.Joanne Lynn, MD. Merck.  October 2007.  Symptoms During a Fatal Illness.  Uploaded 3/1/09.        The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. The natural and instinctive method used by all primates, including humans for defecation, is the squatting position. Squat toilets, sometimes referred to as 'natural-position toilets', are still used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.Kira A. The Bathroom.

innocuous,"` I should like to respectfully disagree in no uncertain terms with Paul's assertion that ``this is pointless`` as well as the implication of his further claim that ``the first phrase is concise and clear.`` Clarity is no virtue when content deceives. And, indeed, the case against the present wording is far worse than even Rogala seems to be aware. Per Nishidani ``it is always best to examine the sources behind statements.``  This is indeed true and one generic failing of the present document is that it so often depends on the kind of secondary or tertiary sources such as those cited in order to make a point when consultation with original documents will put the matter beyond dispute. It is beyond reasonable dispute that the single most important anti-Stratfordian of the twentieth century (possibly excepting Looney) did not support any definitive alternative candidate. That person was Sir George Greenwood.  Greenwood's reticence to follow the Baconian path was anticipated by BOTH Twain and Whitman, with Whitman for his part explicitly disavowing Bacon and telling Horace Trauble, ``we shall see, we shall see``  intimating a belief that the real author had not yet been named as well as making crystal clear that he opposed the Stratfordian interpretation but was unwilling to offer a definitive alternative (See http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/whitman.htm). Greenwood's agnosticism frustrated  Andrew Lang, who in one of the most important anti-anti-Stratfordian books ever written, Shakespeare, Bacon and the Great Unknown, mocked him as an advocate of the ``great unknown.``  Note the title of Lang's book. In 1912 ``the great unknown`` was still a major player, and many of the best minds like Greenwood's not only did not make claims for an alternative author but refused to endorse any of those then in existence. It therefore seems to me that not only is the point a substantive one, but that Rogala's insistence on defending accuracy in wording in this case rest on an absolutely correct view of the history of the dispute, however one reconstructs the view of the contemporary DRD document. It is simply not historically accurate to claim otherwise, end of subject.     ::`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",UETIfJ

innocuous,"`    (1) A remarkable number of the footnotes (as this article now stands, in Aug. of 2011) rely on a SINGLE PAGE of a single work by Gregory Schopen.  That one page DOES NOT support the argument pinned upon it by this wikipedia article (and I know, because I read it: one whole page, what a tremendous burden of fact-checking!).  Please allow me to quote what Schopen's thesis and/or conclusion actually is here: ::``We are left, it seems, with the apparent fact that, at least in regard to major Buddhist cult forms, -the stupa cult and the image cult- the appearance of early Mahayana sutra literature had no effect, changed nothing, and was of no consequence.`` That is hardly the view that is now espoused by this Wikiepdia article!  In this case, I can only surmise that the contributor is intentionally mis-representing the source cited.  It is also problematic that only one half of what Schopen is saying is reflected in these quotations: he is making a specific argument about one stage in the development of the EARLIEST (known) Mahayana literature, while contrasting it to later developments that did indeed go on to do the things discussed in the ensuing history (he is stating that it did not do so ``in its earliest phase or phases``, to quote him directly, just as certainly as it DID do so thereafter; and this is all very clearly said on the very same page!).  Likewise, the actual phrase ``profoundly conservative`` is (horrendously!) quoted out of context as this wikipedia article now stands, and used against its original purpose.  No library required for this one, by the way: this one page that has been so mis-used can be read instantly through google books' preview service.  (2) I also found that Guan Xing does not support some of the views now stated in this wikipedia article.  The source here is The concept of the Buddha: its evolution from early Buddhism to the trikāya ... by Guang Xing (and yes, you can preview that through Google Books, too).  Page 33 states that the Theravada canon does not include the 80 marks, but these are instead a later addition in ``sub-commentaries``.  In general, this whole book contains some very detailed reflections on the fact that Theravada and Mahayana descriptions of the Buddha are NOT identical (e.g., p. 28, e.g., p. 34-5... ) ... genuinely interesting, and. I think, the opposite of what Tengu800 would prefer this article to say.  This article now relies VERY HEAVILY on Guan Xing... but I don't think it even fairly reflects the thesis that the guy's work pursues.  I mention this because the incongruous contrast between citation and source here is a pretty clear sign to me that whoever added all of these citations either did not really read Guan Xing's book, or that they used it insincerely.  Admittedly, I myself just did very rapid fact-checking, and also have not read the book (...I'd like to...); this is a case of a source that is not dubious, but some editor has made very dubious use of it.  (3) The Wikipedia article Race of Jesus opens with this sentence, ``The race of Jesus of Nazareth has been a subject of debate in the western world academia since at least the nineteenth century in Europe.``  So, this article on the Buddha should open with the sentence, ``The physical appearance of the Buddha has been a subject of debate in western academia since at least the nineteenth century in Europe, and artistic representations indigenous to Asia have shown tremendous diversity, over a long and storied history.``  That's NPOV: ``diversity`` and ``debate`` are neutral, and factually correct.  (4) Race of Jesus has a section titled ``Jesus in the Bible``... followed by a very brief survey of primary sources.  How about a very brief sequence of bullet-points listing the influential sources of descriptions of the Buddha's physical appearance?  Please note, the 32 marks are NOT the only source: However, at a minimum, * Theravada Canon (cite a few different suttas by name) * Mahayana Sanskrit Canon (I know we've got one vote for the version of the 32 marks preserved in Sanskrit) * Tibetan Canon (if anything is strikingly different from the above...) * Chinese Canon * Anything uniquely Japanese (if differing in some interesting way from the above)  (5) I would prefer to see it follow after #2, rather than before it, but it is really obvious that someone needs to briefly quote some of the major figures like Thomas William Rhys Davids who did argue that the Buddha was a completely ``natural`` physical person (as opposed to supernatural) and was vaguely desultory toward the tendency to turn him into a god (please do not attack me as if I were supporting this view, I am just stating that it needs to be mentioned in a survey of the academic debates in this section!

Here are some facts I have assembled to see if this moment was possible. *The first actuate clock with a minute hand and seconds was invented by Jost Bürgi in 1577. Only a handful of astronomers could of had these.  *Ludolph van Ceulen published 20 digits of Pi in 1596. At least 11-16 digits were known before his time. *The Gregorian Calendar was inaugurated in 1582 and used by several European countries. Increased talk of dates and times due to the conversion may have helped.    It’s quite possible that some mathematician with access to one of Bürgi's rare clocks could have made the Pi Day connection to 10(or 12) digits, but the closest anyone else could get would be 3/14/1592. However, it really doesn’t matter because the date formats such as mm/dd/yyyy (or dd/mm/yyyy) weren’t in use until modern times.

The handling of the wreckage is one of the chief complaints. Critics note that the crash site was disturbed by the cutting of trees to make way for heavy equipment. Questions have also been raised regarding the means used to move the wreckage, which have included cutting some pieces apart, dragging wreckage across the ground using heavy machinery, and breaking windows to attach equipment. Body parts are still being found at the accident site, and this has led to criticism of the thoroughness of the Russian search for remains. Additionally, the wreckage has been stored outdoors. These issues have caused some to speculate that evidence is being destroyed through either incompetence or deliberate acts. A large segment of the Polish population believes the true cause of the disaster will never be conclusively determined.  =`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",VE92eX

innocuous,"`     Walter,   I see that you are a fellow Christian and a fellow Christian musician, although being 12 years younger than I, it's not likely that you lived through the early days of the ``Jesus Movement`` as I did.    As a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time ``Jesus Musician,`` I've recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site's expenses, you'd be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site's manifold expenses as a ``write-off`` from my professional consulting business.)    Because I grew up with people who hate Contemporary Christian music (and still run into them from time to time), I thought it would be nice to include articles that show some of the ways in which Biblical living, and Biblical worship through contemporary musical forms tie together.    To find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn't find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician's perspective.    So I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals.   You might be put off by a couple of paragraphs in first person, but if you've ever read Paul Baker's books, you'll find all the proof you need that it's an accurate history, even to the minor details.  Or maybe you're put off by some of the ``negative`` statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.  But the sources you cite and books you recommend have sections that are FAR more negative.  Also, I carefully chose details that would get the point across with inspiring the reader to outrage on certain topics, as a fully-detailed account would have done.  I've also ``vetted`` the article for content, balance, and tone by running it past former touring artists and Christian broadcasting professionals who lived through the same era. I have gotten nothing but enthusiastic response.    If you can find another Internet-published article (or ten) on the same subject that is as well written, organized, balanced, and fact-based as my article, please let me know.  I'd be VERY glad to link to them from my web site.  I'd also like to know why you don't link to those articles from the Wiki article?  If they exist, that is.  Finally, I confess that I am at a loss as to why you consider my article either to be a ``commercial advertisement`` or a ``personal blog`` (both accusations came through the message to me, though it was largely ``boilerplate,`` so I'm not sure which part was really yours).  I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.  Also, the article dos NOT contain unverifiable personal ramblings or rants, as a blog would.  (I publish blogs in other web sites so I know the difference.)   Perhaps you object to the fact that I posted the link myself.  Would it be a better article if I asked an industry contact to post the link?  Or maybe you should read the article yourself and let me know specifically what you feel is unsuitable about it?  If you've lost the link, it's at:  http://www.schooloftherock.com/html/a_brief_history_of_contemporar.html  Frankly, I'm hoping that as a fellow musician you find the article edifying, exhorting, and comforting.  And if you ARE aware of anything ``wrong`` with it on any level, please let me know, because I strive for proessionalism.  Sorry for the VERY long comment, and God bless,  Paul Race      `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",mfefHn

Reading over Wikipedia:Non-free_content#Unacceptable_images, I fear that a drawing of seams copied from illustrations of seams in a book may be interpreted like #3, as it is a similar kind of usage.

innocuous,"`  Fourth Examination, 17th December, 1455. [Additional statements.]  The sum of a thousand pounds, or crowns, was given by the King of England for the surrender of the Maid; and an annuity of 300 pounds to the soldier of the Duke of Burgundy who had captured her.   I was appointed notary in the Trial, together with a certain Guillaume Boisguillaume.   The copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion's signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them.   With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process.   Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there.   At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume.   I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death.   A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend.   One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak.   On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, ``Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!`` I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to.   One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him.   Those who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine.   One day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",RdqLWF

Actually, there are two books in that section. There are also a few relevant academic articles and all the remaining relevant reviews that were published in English.  :::About the Einsaztgruppen, you should go back to the wiki article you tried to use against me and read it again. Nowhere it says that they were under orders of the Wehrmacht, but that they were in close cooperation. I'll quote it for you: Each Einsatzgruppe was led by SD, Gestapo and Kripo officers, and its members included recruits from the Orpo, the Waffen-SS, and local volunteers, such as militia groups. Each death squad followed the Wehrmacht Heer (German Army) as it advanced eastwards through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. During the course of their operations, the Einsatzgruppen commanders were authorized to request, and did receive, assistance from the Wehrmacht. Heydrich acted under orders from Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler who supplied security forces on an ``as needed`` basis to the local SS and Police Leaders. They were different organizations. The Wehrmacht could not give order to the SS. Again, from that article: The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich (deputy to Heinrich Himmler) and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. From September 1939 forward the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA – Reich Main Security Office)[4] had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.  :::What Littell does is to make the picture unclear by saying that the Wehrmacht worked too closely with the Einsaztgruppen. The following passage is singular in that respect: “I don’t understand. Who should we take our orders from, in the end? From Reichenau or Jeckeln? And where is Brigadeführer Rasch?”—“I don’t know, Sturmbannführer.”. I suggest changing ``attached`` to ``worked closely with``, ``cooperated`` or something like that.  :::As for the sentence the Sixth Army, the AOK 6, to which we were attached, Littell originally used the verb ``rattacher``, auquel nous étions rattachés, which is usually translated as ``linked``, ``connected`` or ``associated``. By translating it to ``attached``, it took away the double entendre in Littell original text.  :::Unfortunately, we'll have to disagree about the image.      `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",x7hvhB

Sammy Davis, Jr. was invited to accept an honorary membership in the Church of Satan by Michael Aquino. After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was ``only into it for the chicks`` and re-embraced Judaism. At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said ``First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight``, completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism. Davis had been an activist for civil rights, and battled racism, in contrast to the racists and Neo-nazis that often embrace Satanism.

innocuous,"`  ``Totally ignores``? The whole of the third paragraph deals with it. As for incorporating other ``official`` statements, I think the one on ``Biological Aspects of Race`` from the AAPA is a bit more on-topic, even than the AAA statement on ``Race and Intelligence``. The latter is a minute (3 sentence) social policy piece pleading to ``the academy, our political leaders and our communities`` to reject the notion of race. Fine, but I'm more interested in what the experts think, not in how the AAA in its role as a pseudo-political instrument wants to direct social policy. The AAPA piece has substantially more ``meat`` to it, though I think we have to ask whether this article is going to benefit from its inclusion. The question as to whether or not the concept of ``race`` in reference to intelligence is a valid one which can be substantiated by data is one best left answered by the people who measure intelligence. The opinion of an anthropologist is going to be dependent upon the data delivered by fields such as behavioral genetics, not vice versa. That's the key point. Anyway, if we look at the AAPA statement, approximately 3 of their 11 points might be relevant to this discussion. I list them below:  §2. ``Biological difference between human beings reflect both hereditary factors and the influence of natural and social environments. In most cases, these differences are due to the interaction of both. The degree to which environment or heredity affects any particular traits varies greatly.`` (pg. 714)  §10. ``There is no necessary concordance between biological characteristics and culturally defined groups. On every continent, there are diverse populations that differ in language, economy, and culture. There is no national, religious, linguistic or cultural group or economic class that constitutes a race. However, human beings who speak the same language and share the same culture frequently select each other as mates, with the result that there is often some degree of correspondence between the distribution of physical traits on the one hand and that of linguistic and cultural traits on the other. But there is no causal linkage between these physical and behavioral traits, and therefore it is not justifiable to attribute cultural characteristics to genetic inheritances.`` (pg. 715)  §11. ``Physical, cultural and social environments influence the behavioral differences among among individuals in society. Although heredity influences the behavioral variability of individuals within a given population, it does not affect the ability of any such population to function in a given social setting. The genetic capacity for intellectual development is one of the biological traits of our species essential for its survival. The genetic capacity is known to differ among individuals. The people of the world today appear to possess equal biological potential for assimilating any human culture. Racist political doctrines find no foundation in scientific knowledge concerning modern or past human populations.`` (pg. 715)  §2 tells us pretty much the same thing as what we learned from Neisser et al.   §10 is perhaps tangentially relevant, but really addresses the question as to any ``racial`` basis for elements of culture (language, economy, political structure, etc.) which, of course, there is none (the AAPA is simply stating the obvious here, as no one is arguing that such things could have a basis in biology). At the same time, it's trying to avoid saying that the common conception of ``race`` does, to some degree, correspond with the observed physical variation found in human populations - which is commonly accepted - but doesn't quite want to say it, as that's too close for comfort to sounding like there actually are some biological distinctions between ``races`` - which there are, though the whole point here is to de-emphasize them to the point of meaninglessness. Fair enough. I can see what the AAPA is trying to accomplish, and as a social policy, I can recognize its value.   §11 is the closest this statement comes to our topic. Interestingly, it describes intelligence as ``one of the biological traits of our species``. Did they screw up a little here? I'm not going to harp on it. Notice that they simply skirt the issue, though, without getting right down to it. But really, what should we expect from anthropologists? They've taken the ``right`` overall position, which is a vast improvement over the ``science`` of the late 19th century, and I suppose they are to be commended on that point.  Can the overview be improved through the inclusion of this kind of material? I highly doubt it. But I submit this to the discussion of the other editors.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",tDKmdj

Prussians and Austrians, as well as their politics, did not constitute part of the Founding Fathers' vision or hope of the future for America.  You'll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the Habsburg or Hohenzollern (except perhaps Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben) politics in any way were an inspiration for Americans of any or all origins, then and now.  We have had emulation of William van Oranje-Nassau and Prince Rupert of the Rhine including his family such as the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia, but that is because they were Rhenish and any other Palatine (Amish etc., like Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower) culture we pretty much supported always and for all times.  That's different from the East German culture, which has never, ever been a component of Americana and might never be either.  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face.  You have to put the German issue in context; Benjamin Franklin was hostile to ``Palatine Boors`` as he called them, but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death.

innocuous,"`Structural details=== Construction of the towers began in 1968 and was completed in 1970 (1 WTC) and 1972 (2 WTC). 1 and 2 WTC were nearly identical structures. Both had 110 stories, although 1 WTC was 1,368 feet (417.0 meters) tall and 2 WTC was 1,362 feet (415.1 m) tall. 1 WTC also supported a 360 foot tall (110 m) antenna.  The core in 1 WTC was oriented with the long axis east to west, while that of 2 WTC was oriented north to south.  The towers were designed as framed tube structures, with columns grouped around the perimeter and within the core.  The perimeter columns supported virtually all lateral loads, such as wind loads, and shared the gravity loads with the core columns. It was said that Live load on those columns could have been increased more than 2,000% before failure occurred. “The World Trade Center towers would have an inherent capacity to resist unforeseen calamities. [..] For the perimeter columns (83% of total columns)”, “live loads on these columns can be increased more than 2,000% before failure occurs.” One “could cut away all the first story columns on one side of the building, and partway from the corners of the perpendicular sides, and the building could still withstand design live loads and a 100 mph wind from any direction.” All columns were founded on bedrock, which unlike Midtown Manhattan, where the bedrock is shallow, is at 65 feet below the surface.[]  Above the seventh floor there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building.  The perimeter columns had a square cross section, 14 inches on a side (36 cm), and were constructed of welded steel plate.  The thickness of the plates and grade of steel were varied over the height of the tower, ranging from 36 ksi to 100 ksi, with the steel strength and plate thickness decreasing with height.  The columns were connected with deep spandrel plates, which were typically 52 inches (1.3 m) deep. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, and served to transmit shear flow between columns, thus allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads.    The perimeter was assembled from prefabricated modules consisting of three columns and three spandrel plates.  The spandrel plates were welded to the columns at the fabrication shop.  These modules extended for two full floors and half of two more floors.  Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels.  The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.  The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135 feet (27 by 41 m) and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower. The columns tapered with height, and consisted of welded box-sections at lower floors and rolled wide-flange sections at upper floors.  All of the elevators and stairwells were located in the core.  The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by pre-fabricated floor trusses. The trusses had a span of 60 feet (18.2 m) in the long-span areas and 35 feet (11.0 m) in the short span area.  The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on 6 foot 8 inch (2.03 m) centers.  The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side.  Approximately 10,000 of the trusses were also connected to the perimeter columns at their bottom chord through viscoelastic dampers to reduce wind-induced sway for occupant comfort.  The trusses supported a 4-inch-thick (10 cm) lightweight concrete floor slab, with shear connections for composite action.    The towers also incorporated a ``hat truss`` or ``outrigger truss`` located between the 107th and 110th floors.  The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis.  This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower. N",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",iM3lIf

We already know he's a fine editor, now he's demonstrating that he's a patient and gracious one too. Your insults are directly responsible for that. DurovaCharge!   Peek-a-boo, I see you!  Shankbone's ``retirement`` from the Wiki community demonstrates the reverse to be true: he is not patient, he is not gracious.  Truth be told, David Shankbone is needy, capricious, arrogant, and possibly emotionally unstable. David Shankbone's recent improper and unsourced edits at the Michael Lucas bio (made at the behest of Lucas), his abuse of AN/I to elicit sympathy at his ``departure,`` and the imbroglio over his photos all exemplify this.  I think it more likely that my revelations of his unsavory activities, posted at COIN, AN/I and elsewhere, were a direct cause of his ``retirement.``  I can only hope that his retirement is permanent and that he gets the help he needs, right away.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",0wkKiQ

In fact, the army has already accepted the Arjun for introduction into service, based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. After firing trials in summer 2006, the trial report (written by the army) said: ``The accuracy and consistency of the Arjun has been proved beyond doubt.``  The ongoing trials in Pokhran that the army is citing are Accelerated Usage cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT). In these, two Arjun tanks were run almost non-stop for 3,000 kilometres, not to judge performance, but to evaluate the tank's requirement of spare parts, fuel and lubricants during its entire service life.``      `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",sEQYjX

In order to keep to the same format as the driver's standings, I'd suggest using the one showing results.

innocuous,"` :I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly ``encyclopedic`` about bad writing. The bit about Yahweh is directly from Tyson's acknowledgement of error on Facebook, btw, where he still shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of Bush's Biblical quotation is.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",eFquTn

You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of ``mass communication`` and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.   I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.   I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.   No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.   Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.  Here are some other links who do compleete the picture: The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer: http://aeamh.free.fr/x/agent.html http://aeamh.free.fr/blockhaus/ http://aeamh.free/bk/index.html  YBM Web site:  http://aeamh.free.fr Site Voyer: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/  I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.   This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

innocuous,"The SPLC’s Outright Telemarketing Scam PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL OLANICH, ON MARCH 31ST, 2015 telemarketing2014  ONE MONTH ago, we gave the Southern Poverty Law Center the benefit of the doubt concerning their dubious telemarketing practices. Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.  On the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.  For the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.  To wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:  2011:  -$212,214  2012:  -$869,686  2013: -$1,156,765  2014:  -$1,130,680  How in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.  Checking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.  Did anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?  But that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.  And yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.  Best of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”  Dees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.  But think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor till  THIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”  Justify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.  It’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.  * * *  Source: Watching the Watchdogs  SHARE VIA EMAIL OR SOCIAL MEDIA: Email this to someoneShare on FacebookTweet about this on TwitterShare on Google+Share on TumblrShare on VKShare on RedditPrint this page Related Articles:  New Study: SPLC is a Fraud Who’s a White Supremacist?

There's not a single thing about that process which is encouraged on Wikipedia if the goal is to actually form WP:CONSENSUS.

innocuous,"Very soon we all will find more, about who you are.      Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues  You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's.  Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?!  Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.  The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist.  Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers.  What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.  It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.  And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.  It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, outside the chapel, I had my reason. Three people were threatened and harassed by the 'Monroe 6 Version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members. One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this Wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from Canada, a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes.  I am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did.  Success, so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. Jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another.  It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that 'Mark Bellinghaus mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known Lori Drew manner. But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group of people, who have united in order to shut us, three people: Ernest W. Cunningham, Jennifer J. Dickinson and myself up, so that they then can continue with their fraud crimes. Their lies about Marilyn Monroe and anything that has to do with it.  I was absolutely aware of this and I knew that criminals would fight back. That is logic and that is normal. But the strategies these people are using. Trying to befriend us at first, then waiting for the 'kill' and fully attacking us when they believe the time is best for it. This is a realization which will wake up the innocent fans of any late movie star. The power and money behind this conspiracy, and please do not laugh about it, because that is exactly what it is, is frightening and it also is criminal. Lori Drew started a conspiracy against the 13 year old Megan Meier, who ultimately could not cope with so much hate and disgust. We know who initiated this conspiracy and the ugly and super negative edits are proof for it. We used a friendly protest against threats, and the people who are editing hate and fabrication to this article, who fail to add the important articles, such as the three LA Times articles which also give an idea what we went through in three long years, they are looking at this article and they are laughing.

innocuous,"Mary Ambrose was not Robert Palmer's girlfriend at the time of his death, although they had been involved in a casual relationship. However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that. The article was to appear in three parts, but once the publishers realized that the article was a hoax, they cancelled the publication of the other two parts of the article and invalidated the one part that they had ran.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",mP38MP

innocuous,"`   Hi.  The 18th edition of Ethnologue just came out, and if we divide up our language articles among us, it won't take long to update them.  I would appreciate it if you could help out, even if it's just a few articles (5,000 articles is a lot for just me), but I won't be insulted if you delete this request.   A largely complete list of articles to be updated is at Category:Language articles citing Ethnologue 17.  The priority articles are in Category:Language articles with old Ethnologue 17 speaker data.  These are the 10% that have population figures at least 25 years old.    Probably 90% of the time, Ethnologue has not changed their figures between the 17th and 18th editions, so all we need to do is change ``e17`` to ``e18`` in the reference (ref) field of the language info box.  That will change the citation for the artcle to the current edition.  Please put the data in the proper fields, or the info box will flag it as needing editorial review.  The other relevant fields are ``speakers`` (the number of native speakers in all countries), ``date`` (the date of the reference or census that Ethnologue uses, not the date of Ethnologue!), and sometimes ``speakers2``.  Our convention has been to enter e.g. ``1990 census`` when a census is used, as other data can be much older than the publication date.  Sometimes a citation elsewhere in the article depends on the e17 entry, in which case you will need to change ``name=e17`` to ``name=e18`` in the reference tag (assuming the 18th edition still supports the cited claim).   Remember, we want the *total* number of native speakers, which is often not the first figure given by Ethnologue.   Sometimes the data is too incompatible to add together (e.g. a figure from the 1950s for one country, and a figure from 2006 for another), in which case it should be presented that way.  That's one use for the ``speakers2`` field.  If you're not sure, just ask, or skip that article.  Data should not be displayed with more than two, or at most three, significant figures.  Sometimes it should be rounded off to just one significant figure, e.g. when some of the component data used by Ethnologue has been approximated with one figure (200,000, 3 million, etc.) and the other data has greater precision.  For example, a figure of 200,000 for one country and 4,230 for another is really just 200,000 in total, as the 4,230 is within the margin of rounding off in the 200,000.  If you want to retain the spurious precision of the number in Ethnologue, you might want to use the  template.  (First parameter in this template is for the data, second is for the number of figures to round it off to.)   Dates will often need to be a range of all the country data in the Ethnologue article.  When entering the date range, I often ignore dates from countries that have only a few percent of the population, as often 10% or so of the population isn't even separately listed by Ethnologue and so is undated anyway.    If Ethnologue does not provide a date for the bulk of the population, just enter ``no date`` in the date field.  But if the population figure is undated, and hasn't changed between the 17th & 18th editions of Ethnologue, please leave the ref field set to ``e17``, and maybe add a comment to keep it so that other editors don't change it.  In cases like this, the edition of Ethnologue that the data first appeared in may be our only indication of how old it is.  We still cite the 14th edition in a couple dozen articles, so our readers can see that the data is getting old.    The articles in the categories linked above are over 90% of the job.  There are probably also articles that do not currently cite Ethnologue, but which we might want to update with the 18th edition.  I'll need to generate another category to capture those, probably after most of the Ethnologue 17 citations are taken care of.

Here is the statement on WP:SOAP Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:  Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1]   Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to ``climb soapboxes`` (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles.   Scandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person.   Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest.  Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small ``garage`` or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so.    Clearly I have not tried to recruit, sell, gossip or self-promote.  The opinion peices are clearly talking about article and not discussion pages and are stated as such. The opinion I have stated are backed up with facts and hence on the discussion page.  Please enlighten me with what definiton of WP:SOAP you are using.

innocuous,"`        Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - December 9, 1999) was the first president of Croatia in the 1990s.  Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and he became the president of the country. A year later he proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He was reelected twice and remained in power until his death in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled ``Tudjman``.    Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.  During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of Tito's partisans, where he also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the 1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few Communist partisans.  Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history, strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare) — this claim is supported by the fact that generations of future Yugoslav generals based their general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (``War against war``), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan warfare.  Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske (``Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers' Movement``), and remained its director until 1967.    Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav Communist establishment, and was subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi (``Great ideas and small peoples``), a monograph on political history that collided with central dogmas of Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the interconnectedness of the national and social elements in the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during WWII).  In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for alleged subversive activities during the so-called ``Croatian Spring``.  The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party chief Bakariæ in the climate of growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction with the position of the Croatian people in Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by Tito, who used the military and the police to crush what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you ``liars``; from ``Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8``, I quote your statement and my reply to it:  :: QUOTED: ``I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.     :: QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as ``1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.`` First of all, ``all editors have reached a consensus on the article`` is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others ``have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system``, Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around.

It is unclear whether the perpetrator succeeded in many. The following comment was placed on one of the sites by the system administrator. ``Yesterday we were alerted to 200 000 butte force ftp attempts.

The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become ``specialists`` when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's ``estimate`` is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his ``map``). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government ``convince`` people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit).

You all must distinguish me (1) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e.g. see me as the writer of VTFD in 2001, (b) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. You should note that the verifiability condition concerns facts that need be checked by various sources. But the text that I provided (in the disputed criticism section) contains a reasoned argument that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. Thus the condition does not apply in that sense. Also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since I didn't enter original research. The research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. The only thing I do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. Also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. Well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. For, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. If the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. Which is exactly why I added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. I didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. Some other comments: PM 1: I doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then I already included in the list of literature in the links that I provided. If someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. PM 2: Now that Rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header Criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps Evaluation or something like that. PM 3: If the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see Colignatus at wikinfo, and perhaps research a bit how reliable I am. Simply a Google scolar is not enough, though. PM 4: If all this fails, I would like a comment from someone who follows the logic of the reasoned argument and have suggestions how it can remain available for readers, then in another format or place.",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",WAs8Rr

You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.  If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement ``I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later.`` You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",HxUtWo

The other two things are suits Cherney has filed, one in 2006, and one in 2008, both in part directed against Oleg Deripaska. First, these are both just suits with no adjudication. Second, they are outdated because they rely on reports from years ago with no indication on what has happened since. Third, the two suits are mixed up in the two references with different information appearing in each, and the material in our article isn't supported clearly by the two sources.

If six newspapers give figures, and four are similar, with the other two as outliers, that does not mean the four that coincide are more reliable; it may well mean that they all quote from the same initial source. or from one another. Therefore the winnowing process that you describe as having taken place over the past few years is still OR.  ::My suggestion for rewriting this article would be to begin with a prominent, detailed caveat stating that estimates are often speculative, biased, or highly variant, and that where trusted sales figures do exist, mainly at national level, they are often proprietary and/or confidential. The bestseller article has relevant material, though it's not well cited. There is a difference between copyrighted works and out-of-copyright works, which merits separate columns or tables; the former figures are generally more reliable.  It might be wise to have separate columns for national and global totals, since some national totals are more reliable than others.  Finally, and most importantly, once you have decided on a threshold for reliability of sources, then I suggest all figures for a given book that meet that threshold should be quoted, together with the date. Obviously an older figure will not count sales subsequent to its date, but may still be  informative (especially if it is bigger than a later-dated estimate).  A notes column could note instances where sales estimate X has been explicitly endorsed/criticised by source Y. Clearly, for some books, you'll end up with a large number of different citations for different figures; that's more appropriate than doing the selection of just one or two figures here on the Talk page; it lets the readers decide rather than having editors make that decision for them. To save some space, I think the sales figure can take ``millions`` as read.  ::I appreciate that a lot of work has gone into this page; but I believe more of that work needs to be visible to the reader to prevent it being SYN/OR.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",uOYRgN

innocuous,"`First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.    I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.  But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion ``the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary`` DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them.

I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias's policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft's website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka's own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that's okay with everyone.      ::::",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",x6_N7K

(He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know:    1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html    2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html  3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",ZPCX6l

Palin's usage of ``blood libel`` is correct, common and understood to large portions of her American audience - evangelical Christians, who, ironically, use that phrase to defend all Jews (many of whom disparage these, their very own defenders) against the ancient, and Medieval, prejudices of the more 'orthodox' Christian sects. This 'blood libel' originated, not in Medievel myths, but in much earlier 'Catholic' church teachings of the Jews' alleged 'liability' for demanding the blood of Christ on the cross. Never mind that such teaching ignores the fact that Christ was not 'stoned' (the traditional Jewish form of execution), but was nailed to a cross by Roman soldiers. Evangelicals teach that it was Satan, who cried ``Crucify him!`` from the anonimous safety of the crowd, and they believe that all Jews make up a tribe of the Nation of Israel 'chosen' as priests by an unerring God, under an inalterable 'covenant', in his universal plan for an eternal theocratic paradise. They are extremely careful to always support, not disparage or offend, ``God's Chosen People``.

innocuous,"`    Hi Bbb23,  I need your help and some advice about possible sockpuppetry. I am also going to ping   @PBS so that he may have advice as well, or if you are really busy just now.  There has been ongoing disputes, edit warring, blatant blp issues, NPA's up to like 3 now from one certain editor.in and around the article for a pianist here at en wikipedia, as well as the blp board, edit warring boards (reports by two  different editors about the same James Rhodes (pianist)  article, page protection board, where @CambridgeBayWeather saw all the blp issuesthat were going on at the time she judged the need for protection there at the pianist article.  in her admin role semi-protected the article for one week, then there were three WP:NPA violations against him, which I warned the editor on his talk page on two occasions.   Since then the editor has struck up a whole band of possible sock monkeys to help defend him, and also some of the ones have made personal attacks againt me as well in the ani the editor filed.  I have been trying to state what has actually happened over this while, but there is so much disruption, attacking, and lacking good faith by him and some others there.  I just got to thinking this is so weird. All the possible soccy editors seemed to be acting in concert in how the flow of things went there so far.  I just kept my thoughts about all this to myself until now, but it occurred to me to check the block log of this editor to see if he had ever had any trouble with issues that he may have been blocked for.  I  asked him about the two blocks listed in the report. One block was for 72 hours and the next block was an INdeffinent. block. I noticed the offenses listed was sock puppeting and abusing multiple accounts.   When I asked him about the sockpuppetry charge in the ani, he said something to the effect that ``he was testing wikipedias security`` by ``setting up some vandalism only accounts`` to test security. You could read his exact storyline that he posted on there. Are editors allowed to ``test security`` by making up sockpuppets to vandalize editors, articles and such? Is he really working for you as a clerk or something?  To paraphrase, he said at ani it was just a couple of accounts, maybe 2 just to test with. I took his word on that for awhile, but then I took a break from making new articles, to just try typing his editor name and sockpuppet in wp search. This is what I found, it had your name on it so I thought you would be the perfect person to explain to me how this works exactly. [title=Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Gabucho181/Archive&oldid;=663847791]  Maybe I am not reading the pages and archives correctly since I do not follow the spi reports very often.  I see people speak of a duck rule, and or diffs of evidence is needed to request an investigation. I do not know myself is all this meets the duck rule or if there is any real evidence that this user may be continuing to abuse multi accounts or not,  But I was stunned to se reports on his  archive go back to januaey and the latest one was around may 18. Could you read this over if you have time to see if it warrants asking for all this to be checked on. I do not know how to do a spi report. I am not sure if it can be added on to the ongoing list that goes back several months? Please look it over and let me know something. I am going to work offline on my new article sets tonight, and upload them tomorrow or the next day. I have been doing a series of articles about different writers around the world, and then I make a few stubs from red links in the one about the writer.   This is all very discouraging.

Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir.   The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute.   I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise. If Melchoir will e-mail me a snail mail address, I would be happy to send him a copy.

Let me explain why some of the changes you are doing are wrong: * You removed the NOGALLERY tag from Category:Naruto images. Per Fair use criteria, point 9, images can only be used in articles. A category isn't an article, thus it can't display images. The __NOGALLERY__ tag ensures no images are shown in the category. Exceptions are listed in this category. * You have removed the notice that the image is orphaned in some images. Per Fair use criteria #7, every fair use image uploaded in Wikipedia must be used in at least one article. Those images that are not being used must be deleted from Wikipedia. * You have added the  template to an image. The template should only be used in talk pages of articles, when those articles have been used by the media (in example, BBC, CNN, AOL, eWeek, etc) as sources. * You have tagged Image:Real Shuriken.jpg with the  template. This template means YOU created the image. However, you say ``Off Google images``, which I understand you found the image through Google. In other words, you did not create the image, thus it is not yours, thus you can't release with a free license since you don't own the copyrights of the images. * You have tagged an image with  template. This template should only be used in talk pages of articles related to anime, not in images. * You have tagged an image with . This template should only be used in articles when you need someone to explain from where he picked the information, requesting for a reference or source. It should not be used in images.

The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:      ``I talked with that other user and he said since WACL ``makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)`` it should fall under the Rock label. Not AOR, or Classic Rock, just plain old Rock.

The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject. Again I ask that the following changes be made to the content on the WACL article:      WACL (98.5 FM, ``98 Rock``) is a Classic Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Elkton, Virginia, USA, serving the Harrisonburg/Staunton, Virginia, area. WACL is owned and operated by Clear Channel Communications.      History      The station first launched on February 22, 1989, with the callsign WPKZ. During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as ``Z-98``.      On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as ``Cool 98.5``. To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to ``98 Rock``. On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.      Music      WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.  The current content is completely inaccurate and non-verifiable. Because I am an expert, I am considered a verifiable source according to Wikipedia.

innocuous,"`   No good reasons were given for removing my changes, and both they and I have been falsely described. I am not an academic. Nor do I believe that ``only people with european nonmedical academic doctorates deserve to be called doctor``.  The only kind of doctorate is an academic one. Doctorates may be in medicine or any other subject. This is clear from the article, which the reverter appears not to have read properly.  As for 'European', there is absolutely no Eurocentrism in the article. The US (a country with about 5% of the world's population) is exceptional in that bachelor's-level degrees in medicine are on paper called 'doctorates'. I left mention of this exception in the article. I believe, however, that it requires some explanation for those who might not be familiar with its exceptionality.  So that's three lazy errors already in the reverter's blurb: calling me an academic; saying that I think those who don't hold European doctorates shouldn't be called doctors; saying that I think those who hold medical doctorates shouldn't be called doctorates.  Fourth, I left a lot of it as it was.  As for 'perspectives', I have no 'perspective' to offer. I was trying to keep to the facts. It is true that there is a history to this article, but this includes for example the mention by one discussant that 'doctor' is used as a noun to denote those with PhDs as well as to denote those who hold bachelor's-level degrees in medicine. That fact was not mentioned in the article itself before my changes.  (It might also be mentioned that the use of 'PhD' to describe a person, as in 'John is a PhD' is not encountered in the UK - at least, not in my experience. You would say 'John has got a PhD).  My version can doubtless be improved, but this will best be done by those who have read it and considered the merits of the particular changes.  People read encyclopedias to learn new facts. Whilst I am not saying that this one should be prescriptive, this does not mean that ignorant beliefs should not be countered. For example, I have met people in the UK who think that medics are 'doctors of medicine' and that people with doctorates are 'doctors' of some other subject, as if the qualifications were on the same level.

Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament).

There is no clearer policy of wikipedia, despite any guidelines, other than the sincere will of most editors to contribute to this great project and maintin a consensus. There was absolutely NO REASON for ChrisO to be that ``bold``, for it served no purpose. No nationalist Greek's opinion was heard, their opinion being that the name of the country be reverted to FYROM instead of ROM and no ethnic Macedonian had any trouble with the constitutional name of his country. This was a blant attack against the Greek community of wikipedia and tyhose who support them as well as against the very spirit of Wikipedia. Arguments that are heard about the Greeks POVing are ludicrous, since RoM is clearly 100% in favor of the ethnic Macedonians' wishes. There was NO compromise there. Who could possibly claim that naming this country Republic of Macedonia was a violation of ANY rights, wishes etc except those of the Greeks? So, although Wikipedia was 100% behind RoM in this, ChrisO took this dispute to a new level, actually PROVING THE GREEK NATIONALISTS RIGHT!!!

Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description.   The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).

Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.``  It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the ``Howard Johnson's`` scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman.   ``The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).  Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously believe charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.  ``At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.``  Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.    ``As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.``  Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall.   ``After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).``  Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.  ``The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room.

In the transition between egalitarian hunting and gathering, to semi- and fully sendentary living, I think the greatest shift occurred when ``power`` over individuals changed from the elder of the extended family/tribe into the hands of an elite ruling over other families. This is all just definitions. I guess I'm only getting to the point where I ask what everybody else things the definitiary threshold is for the status of ``great power``. Rather than pure quantification, I think the threshold for inclusion should be the simple existence of a ruling political party (still a somewhat obscure term and accompanying definition). Or coming from the other direction, maybe outling some criteria for exclusion: archeological evidence alone does not make a state. Can literacy be used as a standard?

But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...  Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope to release on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include ``Your Touch``, ``The Flame``, and ``It's Just Got to Be``.   Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was ``amicable.`` Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and his bandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an answering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes ``The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'``, which the Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.  Tracklist:  01 Keep Your Hands Off Her 02 Have Mercy on Me 03 Work Me 04 Meet Me in the City 05 Nobody But You 06 My Mind Is Ramblin'  Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream album Bloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.  That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?  The Black Keys are currently in the midst of an Australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like Femi Kuti and Buddy Guy.

innocuous,"`This is completely absurd.  Maybe this is the case in the United States, however your northern neighbour makes no such claims.  The Philosophy of Chiropractic far exceeds a modality (manual/mechanical manipulation) and a lesion (vertebral subluxation/joint dyskinesis). It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.  Also, anyone who knows a lick of neurology realizes that there neurophysiological effects of manipulation and, similarly, there are neurophysiological effects of joint dyskinesis/subluxation.   However, these are being taken in a neuromusculoskeletal context now as well as possible autonomic implications on visceral functions that may arise from chronic NMS pain syndromes.  This is a contemporary view of the profession.  The title DC or chiropractor certainly does not imply manipulation for subluxation.  Again, a narrowed view focus.  Rather we are holistic NMS doctors with an emphasis on manual therapies and other complementary therapies.  We;re not wannabe MDs or ``glorified PTs``.  DCs trained in scientific schools are perfectly positioned to play a crucial role in managing and preventing NMS issues and PCP role.   I would encourage you, Fyslee, to visit the CCA website or the new OCA one and you tell me that my sole purpose is to rid subluxations.  It is, at least in Canada, a dying faction as CMCC and UQTR embrance scientific chiropractic and not traditional/philosophical (straight) chiropractic.  www.chiropractic.on.ca  It is always important to have different perspectives on issues to remain objective.  I am not an evangelist (as a good analogy to the straights/subluxation based) and definitely have my criticisms with my profession, but it's mainly a generational thing.  The evidence-based Doctor of Chiropractic in 2008 is not tied down to the philosophy of subluxations (metaphysically) or at least in Canada (my POV which conflicts with your chiropractic POV which is US and not a world wide one.    In fact, every DC since 2002 has been educated in the integrative EBM curriculum (CMCC is 45 minutes away from McMaster University, where evidence based medicine was born) Canada, unlike the US has NO subluxation based schools and they are both university degree granting institutions.  This is important because credits obtained at CMCC and UQTR can be TRANSFERRED to public universities unlike before.  In the end, Fyslee, you will begin to appreciate the sophistication of contemporary chiropractors.  Most of us have 4 year undergrad degrees in kinesiology of the life sciences and obtain various other treatment modalities (soft tissue such as ART/Graston/SASTM, get diplomas in Medical Acupuncture from McMaster University by the Department of Anaesthesia from MDs who designed the course from a anatomy/neurophysiological POV, obtained CSCS designations from the NSCA (http://www.nsca-cc.org/) etc.  I am anxious to hear your response.    `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",_eDxUI

innocuous,"`    I propose to change this page and show in it only reference links to various comparison charts, because it fails to show (as stated in the title):  [Quote] The table only includes systems that are widely used and currently available. Due to the large number and variety of available Linux distributions, all of these operating systems are grouped under a single entry in these tables. [End quote]  It could have been called ``Comparison table of OSes recent than 5 years``, but it still presents MacOS and not only Mac OS X, that is the current selling version. (For example Windows'95 and windows'98 are both canceled from the table, and only Windows ME is shown. And it is correct. because both 9x versions are discontinued from market longer than 5 years.)  OS/2 is discontinued, and IBM plans to release it Open Source, but it is still on the table.  Linux OSes are shown apart. Their invoice is no longer (?) necessary.  It lacks of OSes still on the market, such as AmigaOS, which recently started also 2 split versions, AROS and MorphOS (and also MorphOS it is currently on the market). [I wrote AmigaOS invoice in the table and I planned to insert MorphOS later].  It lacks of very interesting OSes currently on the market such as RTOS (Real Time Operating Systems), which major representative is QNX.  Also it could have been called ``Comparison Table of Operating Systems with a million or larger userbase``, but then, FreeBSD and Solaris are far from reaching this record of installed releases.   So I propose to create multiple pages of comparison charts, and this page pointing with respective links to each of them (Historical chart ones, OSes actually on the market, Linux Only, etcetera).  But one chart amongst the others must be a very extensive comparison table showing all existing OSes, present and past ones, to be of reference for all readers, and mainly students and scholars.  Criticisms and advices are welcome.  Insert your Sign and say why, if you agree or refuse to change this page.      [Whoops. Sorry. I am Raffaele_Megabyte, and I failed to log, becase I reconnected internet after a brief pause]  : In my opinion the tables should list OSes that are widely used. However, use isn't the same as number of installed systems; that number just boosts desktop operating systems out of proportion. If, for example, a Solaris system runs an application server used by 100 users, that would really have to count as 100 users, not just one. A good measure might be how often an OS or services running on an OS are directly or indirectly used by how many users. Or to put it another way, the amount of ``real work`` done using that OS. (Of course this cannot really be measured, only estimated). : Basically I'm all for including OSes like QNX and similar systems, as right now the embedded operating systems are very under-represented. However, if we were to go down that road all the way, then we'd have to start including e.g. Symbian OS or Windows CE, too, and there isn't really much point in comparing e.g. Symbian OS to Solaris. : So if there was to be a split at all, I'd split it by target system type, i.e. server OSes, workstation/desktop OSes, embedded/realtime OSes. With that kind of split, many systems could be clearly assigned to one of the types, instead of having to maintain the same data multiple times. Also, splitting into multiple tables doesn't necessarily mean splitting into multiple articles. For example, it would be possible to simply have one section per target system type. : In either case, I'm very much against doing this kind of change in the ``reorganize first, fix later`` style, since a lot of changes tend to stop after the ``reorganize`` phase and never get around to actually filling in all the new content (E.g. I've seen a fair amount of people who insist that OS xyz has to be in the tables, but then can't actually be bothered to add more than a sketchy version of the ``general information`` data.) : Instead, I suggest you create the reorganized version as a page in your user namespace, and then post a link here for discussion.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",tHDovR

If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.    *At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy.

innocuous,"```Nu metal`` was a term that was in use for a very brief period of time and, in most cases, was used inconsistently, generally applied to groups of musical groups in various genres who happened to tour together. Most bands who had previously been tagged as ``nu metal`` were described as with different terms later in their career. The argument is not actually about the terms being applied, but more that Zouavman Le Zouave has accused me of being ``unable to respect consensus``, even though I cannot see an actual consensus in any previous archived discussion, whereas I feel that Zouavman takes a negative attitude towards editors who do not agree with his opinions. I don't have a strong opinion on the inclusion of progressive metal as a genre term, but I would like Zouavman to take an interest in coming to an agreement with other editors rather than drawing out a long argument that goes nowhere, and I do not think that we should categorize musical groups on the basis that they were in ``the right place at the right time``, as there is significant opinion by both music journalists and fans that the categorization of ``nu metal`` for System of a Down is inaccurate.

innocuous,"` = Let me state a fact: if you think ``Religious violence in India`` has nothing to do with anti-Hindu violence, then I will move it to Violence by Hindus in India against other ethinicites. Then we will debate about what should be here, and what should go there. If you are disagreeing with the fact that anti-Hindu violence is real, then you should get your facts correct (and wikipedia here will not help you, unfortunately). Google is full of webpages, until you subscribe to Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_circumstantial, common around here, then it will be a littler harder to find. Haphar's theory of what is religious violence and what is not is his own theory, and as such he is entitled to have his own opinions (``POV``, a wikiaholic would say) - while they stay out of the article. I am personally entitled to my opinion that his theory is laughably ridiculous - Islamic terrorism - enough said. Regarding having found books about religious violence in India, who is saying it is not present in India? I am saying that no such country exists with two different religions coexisting, and no act of violence ever happening. Having found books doesn't make it worthy of having an article about it. For example, ``Xenophobia in eastern Europe`` is a well studied phenomena, but we don't have an article about it.  What it does attain, though, is a major part in the discussion. Your rejection of anything else is incorrect.  Anyway... every year there is a new crop of trolls and POV pushers, and my energy is better spent elsewhere. I would just say that ``Religious violence`` does not refer to ``Hindus killing Muslims`` - it refers to ``Hindu and Muslims killing each other, and the people with local majority winning.

innocuous,"`     According to Simon Schama's book The Power of Art, Guernica was painted in response to an article that Picaso saw in an French newspaper. The first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell. He had agreed to do 'a politically minded painting' for a 1937 Paris Fair, but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in Geurnica unfolded. It was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work.      I cut this from the article.  :A story, quite possibly apocryphal, circulates about Guernica. During World War II, a German officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time, in the presence of Picasso.  In a wondering tone he asks Picasso ``Did you do this?`` and Picasso replies: ``No, you did.``  If it is ``quite possibly apocryphal`` and we have no attribution or citation, it does not belong in the article.   |   :Except that this is extremely widely believed and noted.  I recall hearing the equivalent when I was at the Prado. -   ::Then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told. (& was Guernica ever in the Prado? In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   |   :::Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -    The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:  Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, ``Did you do that?,`` Picasso coldly had replied, ``No, you did.``   Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC) * We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   |   *: Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  ·  16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC) *:: If anyone is up for some library work: old Newsweeks are pretty easy to find.   |      I reverted this from Category:Paintings containing nudity to Category:Paintings.

There is a man in the tree!`` Then a 13 year old boy who was playing hockey in the garden said: ``I cant see his face!``. 5 I quietly uttered a prayer of thanks for this. 6. Another girl about 15 years of age approaches and they all together start yelling things like: ``Thats funny!`` from little girl whom I had just recently seen dancing with headphones on in her sisters room. `` Waah! Hes too scared to come down!`` from the 13yr turd. In addition to many other jeers and such.  7. They carried on with their game while I developed cramp and was looking for a way to get down soon to relieve my discomfort. They occasionally ventured a glance in my direction. 8.

I hung about watching the tree to see if they were going to come near. They did not. I trod in dog faeces as I climbed into the car 15 minutes later.  I am sure that they do not know of the paltform.

Look back at the history of revisions on the Beat Generation page back to between the summer of 2006 and the fall of 2008. I literally created the entire section of the page called ``cultural context`` and wrote most of it. I wrote the section now called ``writers``  which I don't believe is accurately named, but that's another issue  as a section called ``usage``. Look at the Allen Ginsberg page. My intentions are positive; up until my antagonization of Tao, I have been cordial and have worked in a postive direction for over four years. What I want is the truth. What I want is accuracy on pages. That's what drives me in situations like this. Blocking me is not working toward the end of improving Wikipedia. Please actually listen to me  and I mean actually listen to me. Don't scan. Read carefully. I urge you once again, read the ``Formal argument edition`` entry and the ``get down to business entry``. Please actually read it. If I'm wasting your time, you are not doing your actual job and your blocking becomes meaningless  what if a police officer threw someone in jail and then claimed he didn't have the time to do the investigation? That would completely invalidate the judgement, especially when so much of the evidence in this case has been completely ignored. You claim I was dishonest in creating my sockpuppet; I was nothing but honest. Your claims demonstrate a lack of concern to find the actual truth in this situation, so I urge you, please, consider the actual truth carefully.  This is a genuine appeal because at this point I think the blocking represents a total absence of justice. I promise to not attack Tao or anyone else ever again and comply by the rules. Being blocked was fun but it got boring quickly. Now that that motivation is gone, I have no motivation to try to get blocked again. I swear to you.

There are many different opinions on their racial makeup. One opinion among some scholars is that ancient Egypt was a multi-racial society. Another opinion held by other scholars is that that ancient Egyptians were black African peoples, claiming that this ``black identity`` was strongest in early Egyptian history and waned over time. They also assert Egypt remained essentially a black African civilization throughout the dynastic era.

Mattisse referred to herself as a grandmother in the past. Calling someone ``old`` and a ``lady`` is inoffensive. If I called someone a ``hag`` or ``on their death bed,`` then you would have a point. But unfortunately, nothing occurred here except your inability to properly manage your job at Wikipedia. Your ignorance of my attempts at mediating the arguments over the Caisson (Asian architecture) article and past attempts in helping Mattisse over drapetomania and psychiatry is disappointing. I would hope that someone of your position would accumulate a background of knowledge before taking such drastic attempts of warning and blocking other members. Also, your arbitrary decisions while ignoring evidence of the other party's violations is repulsive for me to see on a site such as Wikipedia.

On the one hand I had to save the life of Mr. Gandhi; on the other, I had to protect the legitimate rights of millions of my fellow untouchable brothers with the full value of my life. I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact.

Not all those who use English speak it as their first language, and many of them are bound to use the word ``American`` differently than those who do. It would be nice to have some reliable sources on this, but I doubt there are many. And unless some are found, we really can't add speculation into the article. Most sources we do have - dictionaries and the like - are geared towards native speakers of English and its prominent dialects (Canadian English, African American Vernacular English, etc.) As to the use of ``American`` as a political tool to enforce Manifest Destiny and deny the sovereignty of other American states, well, I don't think there is any significant debate on the matter. I've never even heard of such an idea from anyone besides WilyD.

innocuous,"` anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it.  *Dictionary it, or delete it?   *Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less.  Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction.  The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}.  Both articles discuss the city of Limerick.  We don't have duplicate articles about the same thing here.  However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as ``Stab City`` for the reasons stated needs to be checked.  The article, like so many such articles, doesn't cite any sources.  With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say ``That's a load of old baloney!  Limerick isn't known as Stab City at all.`` and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for.  Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite.  Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger.   **The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as 'Stab City' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling '``Stab City`` -Limerick' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig.   ***It wasn't a stub needing work.  It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple.  Both articles are about the city.  I've pointed this out several times, now.  I've also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one.   ***You haven't explained why it is 'clearly' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. ``Stab City`` is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The ``Stab City`` article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don't have the time or interest to do this.  Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: ``City of Light usually refers to Paris.`` would you put a merge note on Paris too?   ****If it were as superficially bogus as ``stab city`` was: Yes, of course.  This process is known as ``asking for the opinions of other editors``.  It is a useful tool in some circumstances.  Notice that it works.  Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion.    *****It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice.   ******I've restored it.  The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote ``as superficially bogus as 'stab city' was``.   *******Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute?   ********Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice.   ** The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed.  I think this was in the mid 1980s.  I haven't edited the Stab City article as I'm undecided as to whether it's worth having.   *Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article. * I agree, merge it now. I can't see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article.

I really was trying to assess the post-mortem reaction - like a living man who gets his obitary putlished!  This is no April Fool's Day joke. Thanks for all you have done to help me over the years at Wikipedia.  I hope that we can stay in touch via e-mail.

If the Cubs win the NL pennant, I will make a brief comeback to discuss the World Series.  That will be an event I could not pass up!  Wknight94 probably will stay retired - even if his New York Mets make the Series.        Some wiseguys have been reverting material on my talk page.  I would appreciate it if that would stop.  I also seriously believe that it is not Liebman who is making the entries or deletions.  I checked with some of the executives and the more prominent resarchers in SABR and they have confidentially revealed that he is a responsible person and a responsible researcher - not a ``nut,`` a ``jerk,`` or an ``idiot.``  ``Baseball Bugs`` should also be a man and follow through on his retirement without dangling it like carrot.  ``Baseball Bugs`` - not Liebman - has caused most of the dissension on Wikipedia.

To keep it from bloating up with that stuff. Also, there should be some fairly heavy warnings right up front. I would expand the {{distinguish}} header to say something like: This article is about the general term as it refers to many fields of reproducable knowledge, including mathematics and applied sciences. For the specific topics of experimental study by scientists, see Natural science.  As for specifics, the first thing I would do is move the ``Formal sciences`` part ABOVE the scientific method, since the full method as we know it, isn't really used in the formal sciences. And we need to talk about many of these, including classificational sciences and methadologies, statistics, etc, before we get to the scientific method, in which all these feature as ``taken for granted`` out-of-the-box tools, not fields of study.  The other thing that distinguishes the ``experimental sciences`` from those that merely describe (formal sciences, but also political science and government theory, which begins to look like the study of history) is that experimental sciences include the variable of TIME. Thus, they all succeed or fail in whether they are not only explanatory, but also predictive. And the predictiveness must include the future as well! ``Prediction is very hard, especially about the future`` sounds like something Yogi Berra would have said (and he is credited with it sometimes), but it's actually first said by Neils Bohr. Who knew that retrodiction is prized in science if it flows naturally from a theory (the theory doesn't look too ad hoc), but prediction is even more highly-prized. And one must discuss this. When a theory explains something that has already happened (like a lot of political science) it's retrodiction. But nobody expects historials to predict the future and nobody really hires poli-sci profs to be political consultants and campaign managers those jobs really ARE applied sciences, even experimental sciences, in the way we mean classically. So are large parts of computer science you never know what will happen with a large program, and there's only one experiment run the code. Rutherford's division of all science as ``either physics or stamp collecting`` is the division between induction and deduction, but also between past classification, and future-prediction that is necessarily uncertain. Often it's ONLY the time variable that brings uncertainty to induction (everything else you can easily fix with redefinition). All this must be explained. A fully applied science like engineering must be (almost) fully predictive (engineering experimentation goes on, but this is materials science and other physics-like disciplines). Much of political science and library science is not predictive but only explanatory. None of the humanities are at all predictive, and that may be what makes them humanities. The predictable part of the fine arts are the craft things, and they are sciences in the wider sense of word. And so on. This is the article to discuss all that.  The scientific method and philosophy of science should go in those articles, and only be summarized shortly here, inasmuch as it applies to only parts of ``real knowledge`` in many other disciplines. I would say that ``science`` implies an algorithm that you can reduce to a series of steps that will work. It's what's left that is humanities, history, fine art, and whatever is left of the ``softer`` disciplines after whatever algorithms and predictiveness they offer has been removed (as the parts that have been ``reduced to a science``) and you then look at whatever is left.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",iGnelN

Optionally you could expand the ``reception`` section; there's lots of commentary on  Szigeti's playing, and contrasts with his contemporaries  oh, you know, everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting  none of that is necessary, though, it's just something I might do if I were writing it.  I wondered about separating out the ``family life`` section from the main biography, since you cover the ``bureaucratic entanglements`` part twice, but in different levels of detail, but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it, so ... maybe fine as is.  Good article!      :Oh, one other minor thing  I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns, such as   I hope I didn't inadvertently bork your paragraphing, since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window.

He seems to have no grasp of encyclopedic style, neutrality, what is important and what isn't, what to leave out, when to cite a source, and of course, how to write in proper English. And he's still inserting favorable comparisons to Thalberg and Tausig everywhere, and making snide remarks at me in his edit summaries even though I have not communicated with him at all since he returned. So...what is to be done in such a situation? Cheers,    :Honestly ... no.  Nothing blockable there.  While I admit I haven't looked at all of his additions, he is trying to improve the encyclopedia, as are you.  Content disputes such as this are among the most stressful things on the project. I'd just edit out the POV and uncited stuff after a little delay, adding cite tags for things that look plausible, and try not to interact with him personally.  He may be enjoying you overreacting to him, and enjoy tweaking you:  I know it's hard to let this stuff go (see my ) but sometimes you just have to.  Looking at one of his edits at random, , the bit about Saffle in the reference appears to be his personal opinion, and should go (and how do you cite something within a cite?)  I hope this helpsI really think he's trying to improve the encyclopedia, but just doesn't quite get NPOV and need for citing.

innocuous,"`    Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.  From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006   'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'  The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, ``In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words ``comfort women`` are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966.   In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as ``yanggongju`` or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.  In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual ``yanggalbo`` (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent.   Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

innocuous,"`  = The first section in the Islamophobia article dedicated to in-depth development of the concept...  The concept of Islamophobia has been criticized on several grounds.[24][25][26] Some critics argue that it is real, but is just another form of racism and does not require its own category,[27] while others argue that it is used to censor criticism, that its use threatens free speech,[25][28] or is used to silence issues relating to Muslim populations in Western countries.[29]  Novelist Salman Rushdie and others signed a manifesto entitled Together facing the new totalitarianism in March 2006 which denounced Islamophobia as ``a wretched concept.``[23] British academic Michael Burleigh argues that the term 'spares anyone the need to examine what has gone wrong within [Europe's Muslim] communities'.[29] Others, such as Edward Said, consider Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a 'secret sharer' in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.[30][31][32] However, Daniel Pipes says that ``'Islamophobia' deceptively conflates two distinct phenomena: fear of Islam and fear of radical Islam.``[33]  The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede is criticized by professor Fred Halliday on several levels. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be ``Anti-Muslimism.``[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that ``the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.``[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34] British writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik's commentary ``makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,`` according to Bunglawala.[38]  In the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12 writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of ``Islamic totalitarianism``. The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of ``Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year`` at the 'Annual Islamophobia Awards' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam ``... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.``[41]  In an article called ``Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics``, Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that ``One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise.`` She also chides some ``people on the left`` for using the same ``Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime``. She concludes with the statement ``At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.``[42] Johann Hari of The Independent has criticized the use of the term by organizations like Islamophobia Watch, arguing that liberal Muslims interested in reform are left unsupported because people fear being accused of Islamophobia.[43] Writing in the New Humanist, philosopher Piers Benn suggests that people who fear the rise of Islamophobia foster an environment ``not intellectually or morally healthy``, to the point that what he calls ``Islamophobia-phobia`` can undermine ``critical scrutiny of Islam as somehow impolite, or ignorant of the religion's true nature.``[44] The New Criterion editor Roger Kimball argues that the word ``Islamophobia`` is a misnomer. ``A phobia describes an irrational fear, and it is axiomatic that fearing the effects of radical Islam is not irrational, but on the contrary very well-founded indeed, so that if you want to speak of a legitimate phobia... ...we should speak instead of Islamophobia-phobia, the fear of and revulsion towards Islamophobia.``[45]  Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris has openly criticized the term Islamophobia in an article stating:[46] There is no such thing as Islamophobia. Bigotry and racism exist, of course—and they are evils that all well-intentioned people must oppose. And prejudice against Muslims or Arabs, purely because of the accident of their birth, is despicable. But like all religions, Islam is a system of ideas and practices. And it is not a form of bigotry or racism to observe that the specific tenets of the faith pose a special threat to civil society. Nor is it a sign of intolerance to notice when people are simply not being honest about what they and their co-religionists believe.   Meanwhile, coverage of ``criticism of the concept`` in the Antisemitism article is...  [empty ... there is a single-sentence allusion to criticism of something called ``The New Anti-Semitism`` and that's it.]  If that were an isolated incident, it wouldn't be upsetting. It is not an isolated incident. It's part of a pervasive systemic bias in Wikipedia, that you even find in odd articles like Lara Logan. The encyclopedia is bigoted, and the bigotry is well-known. It has been well-known for years (under the name ``systemic bias``), and tolerated, even reinforced by witting and unwitting admin actions. The article on Islamophobia is Islamophobic. That's pathetic.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",QPL1Ou

innocuous,"`  ``To state that is not correct is contradicting sourced material.``  From the context, it appears that youre trying to contradict me, but I don't see how your comment advances that goal.  That the Resolution did not explicitly assert either claim absolutely is sourced; one need only look at the Resolution to see that.  That critics have not found a claim which is clearly false is a negative claim; do you seriously expect me to prove it?  What else is there?  That critics have claimed the war is based on lies?  You aren't seriously disputing that, are you?  So what, exactly, are you claiming is ``unsourced and incorrect``?  Nice how anything that doesn't fit with your radical leftism is a ``highly biased slant``.  As I have said, the Resolution never claimed that there was a working relationship between SH and AQ.  If you want to claim that the Resolution implied false statements, fine.  But anyone who claims that there is a single statement in the Resolution which is an outright lie is simply being dishonest.  Now, the Resolution cites Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction capability.  It does not cite Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, YOUR edit is inaccurate and unsourced.  Since you have been informed of the error, and yet you continue to make a claim that you know is false, your editing is clearly vandalism, and if you continue to remove the word ``capability``, I will seek administrative action.  There is simply no room for disagreement on the Contents section.  When discussing what a document says, we should quote what it actually says, rather than editing it for political convenience.  In the Weapons of Mass Destruction and Al-Qaeda section, you again are restoring unsourced statements.  The ``cite`` for the claim that WMD and AQ were the main reasons is simply an article saying that there were 27 rationales.  It doesn't actually say what any of those rationales are, let alone make any determinations as to which arguments were ``principal``.  It's quite the pot calling the kettle black when you insist on including completely unsourced claims, yet refuse to allow me to present any opposing views on the basis that it's ``highly biased``.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",3SUB1a

Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.``  Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, ``Now`` is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?  JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.  Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, ``Now`` is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?  Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:  Joshua also said:  ``In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.``  Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?  Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:  ``ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using ``Darwinist`` as a slur somewhat irrelevant;``  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?  ``if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.``  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!  ``I suggest you calm down``  I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?  I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:  ``Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.`` - Ephesians 4:26-27  Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's.   ``and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.``  Oh the old ``you need to read it but I don't`` and ``you sit and think while your grounded young man`` insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.  I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.  I'll enhance the list for you:  Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

What are you references for this vague ``other issues`` JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?  And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said ``predicted`` in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA. If you are unable to tell the difference between past tense and future tense, what business do you have playing judge? If you are unable to figure out the difference between multiple meanings of words and are quick to judge (that means rushing carelessly to judge) what business do you have being a judge? Big duh right there. Here you go Joshua, read the verses again, and please explain how you missed that they are past tense:  ``For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they BECAME [PAST TENSE JOSHUA] futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they BECAME fools, and EXCHANGED the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. Therefore God GAVE them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. For this reason God GAVE them up to dishonorable passions. For their women EXCHANGED natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.``  Did those caps help Joshua? Were those big enough hints for you? And Joshua, since when is the Christian teaching that ignoring God leads to homosexuality, ``original``? Are you blind? Did those plainly worded verses (they aren't metaphors genius) pose to great a challenge for your mind to understand? Where have you been while Christians for the past 100 years have been preaching that turing away from God leads to homosexuality? Well you fake religion expert? Well lying Joshua? Where ya been Mr. Judge of Christianity? Can we see your degrees in religion and Christian history oh Expert Judge JoshuaZ? Got any references for us that can be substantiated and verified? Lol. Not.  So, again, what business do you have judging?  Take a hint from God, your master who you are mocking and disobeying:  ``Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.`` Proverbs 26:12  Fool in ancient Hebrew means ``very wicked person``. So there is more hope for a very evil man then for you Joshua.  ``A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.``   Reference? From Proverbs 29:1, in the Bible, the best selling most archeologically and scientifically verified historical record in the world. Reference?:  See Scientifically and Archeologically Substantiated and Verified Books Proving the Accuracy of the Bible.  I suggest you play catch up with me, Starfire, and the other 30+ million Calvinists, including the scientists among them who you don't hold a candle to.  Joshua, lose the smug, bitter and hateful attitude and realize this truth: Just because you didn't call anyone a moron or hypocrite doesn't mean you are not personally attacking, not being hateful, and not insulting. Do you understand that truth Joshua? It's very simple, it doesn't take a genius to understand. Learn what ``passive aggressive`` means too.  Personal attacks are not whatever you say they are, nor is a personal attack unjustified if you are vandalizing Wikipedia. You, a PERSON, are attacking Starfire, A PERSON, on Wikipedia, so stop acting surprised when you are attacked back. Lose the God complex, the ``Do as I say not as I do attitude`` Joshua.  Note: JoshuaZ's lies against Starfire777 (lies which are ultimately against God) can be found in the ``User Starfire777 Baited by Darwinists and Blocked`` htm file which is in the ``Banning Christian Editors Using Unsubstantiated Accusations`` folder.

The Huffington Post blog that everyone insists is WP:RS for the article states clearly that ``The movement's founder, Peter Joseph, came to notoriety with his 2007 internet film sensation, Zeitgeist, and it's 2008 successor, Zeitgeist: Addendum. While many people may find it hard to digest the idea of a world without currency, Joseph's argument that our economic system is the source of our greatest social problems was supported with valuable evidence``. This argument is precisely that of TZM. Other sources have also made the obvious connection, as you must be well aware - I fail to see how ii could be argued otherwise.

In this regard, it totally left out the history of the Serer people (also spelt ``Serere``, ``Seereer``, ``Sérère`` and ``Sereer``) who are not only the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia along with the Jola people (Source: Gambian Studies No. 17. People of The Gambia. I. The Wolof. By David P. Gamble & Linda K. Salmon with Alhaji Hassan Njie. San Francisco 1985.)  to which Takrur is part of, but the article gives the impression that Takrur was founded by the Fula people and/or only the Fula when both historical and archaeological sources contradicts that claim.  In fact, at the date and time of raising this article for discussion, no attempt was made by certain people to acknowledge the trutful history of the Serer people who resided at Takrur or Tekrur. Edits I had previously made were vandanlised by a certain person with false and ridiculous accusations. As such, I call all interested parties for an open discussion before I start making further edit on this article.  That aside, there is no mention of the Serer people in this article.  It is a fact that members of the Serer group have resided in Takrur for milleniums, ruled it, implanted their own royal dynasty as well as their ancient religion (The Serer Religion or ``Fat Rog``).    The following is a quote from Henry Gravrand, author of ``La Civilisation Sereer Pangool`` who also authored ``La Civilisation Sereer Cossan``:  ``Since the publication of ``Cossan`` (history), I took as a starting point of the Sereer story in Tekrur over 2000 years ago, I noted an important discovery. In the middle of the Sahara, in the Tasili the rock carvings listed by Henri L'hote, appears the traces of the present ``Sereer Cossan`` (Serer history) or their ancestors, a period dating back to the third or fourth millennium. This engraving represents the Sereer initiation Star (Serer Cosmology),  with two coiled snakes, symbols of the ``Pangool`` (ancestral spirits also ancient Serer Saints in the Serer Religion)... The rock where the Star appears is the Sereer symbols of the Pangool which was probably a place of worship.``  (Source: Henry Gravrand. La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool.  Published by Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal. 1990. Page 9. ISBN: 2-7236-1055-1.)  The history of the Serer people who resided at Tekrur, the influence of their culture, history, religion and tradition on the land should not and cannot be erased from history.  To quote Issa Laye Thiaw, author of ``La Femme Seereer``:  ``If the term ``“religiosity`` expresses the commitment or devotion to a particular religion, it also applies to the Serer who are jealously attached to their traditional values and show little interest in respect of religions from outside. However, few people adhere to these religions and gradually move away from the religion of the land.   The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds. In this context, their Serer neighbours assigned names and adjectives to things they have invented from scratch, trying to prove their superiority and that of their religion (the Serer Religion)…. The Serers are so far, one of the few people of Senegal who are not yet fully converted to a modern foreign religion…. Obstinately attached to the religion of their ancestors, the Serers refused to change the social and religious life inherited from their ancestors, making every effort to prevent the penetration of foreign religions in their country.  Only recently were they superficially converted to Islam and Christianity.``   (Source: Issa Laye Thiaw. ``La Religiosite de Seereer, Avant et pendant leur Islamisation``. Ethiopiques no: 54, Revue semestrielle de Culture Négro-Africaine. Nouvelle série, volume 7, 2e Semestre 1991.)  Issa Laye Thiaw's remarks about Islam is absolutely relevant as far as this article is concerned. For a more detailed explanation of what Issa Laye Thiaw is referring to when he said ``The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds`` please refer to Maba Diakhou Bâ's discussion page.  The URL is as follows:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maba_Diakhou_B%C3%A2  As for this article, Issa's remark is relevant.

innocuous,"`  Yeah well, I've corrected the paragraph twice and if you want me to do it a third time you need to pay me. Stating that people with albinism also can have nearsightedness and farsightedness is like saying people with pneumonia can also have a clubbed foot. When you list signs and symptoms of a disease, you limit them to the ones that are caused by or associated with the specific disease. Astigmatism is on the cornea, more rarely in the internal lens, and is an error of refraction. It has absolutely nothing to do with the pigment in the retinas. Albinism is a lack of pigment, the cornea doesn't need pigment to develop properly. The fovea, however, needs a normal RPE to develop properly. It isn't actually known why, but we do know this to be the case. In order to save myself time looking each fact up, I will just cite the most encyclopedic text and I'm sure every one of these points is there. However, you can't just point to one sentence and say ``here it is`` you actually have to study the entire book to get an understanding of all this information. For example, you are never going to find one sentence in any text that states specifically that ``albinos have the same prevalence of nearsightedness as the regular population.`` No text would ever say that. They would say in one spot what albinism is, and in another spot say what nearsightedness was, and leave it up to the reader to understand the two have nothing to do with each other. Otherwise they would have to say in the description of each disease all the other thousands of diseases that have nothing to do with it. Would I look up pneumonia and find a specific sentence, ``pneumonia has nothing to do with clubbed foot.`` It seems to me that the original writer needs to cite a reference that albinism is associated with refractive errors, and if not, it just needs to be deleted. I can't cite a reference for a null, I can't cite a reference for someting I deleted. Do I just leave a blank line and cite why it's not there?

That said, if you're looking for humor, I'd say it was hilarious when Rothschild claimed Jupiter was closer to the sun than earth.  It was also hilarious when Jones said ``Take me lord Rothschild, take me!`` in immitation of a woman being impressed at Rothschilds self-given title of ``adventurer``.  Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.  Anyway, if we're to believe David de Rothschild's book, then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters, ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars, and build straw houses.  If anyone can show me a Rothschild (of the actual European banking line) that doesn't live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house, I will actually waste money on this chap's silly, insulting book.  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book.  As for Rothschild's demeanor, of course he was somewhat calm, it's part of the training.

Wenn ich ein problem habe, dann sag mir wie das geht. Ich schreibe immer, dass das bild von einem wikipedianer ist. ich weiss nicht wie. ich bin neu. nur 1 monat bin ich aktiv.ich dachte ist normal, wen ein bild von wiki ist, dass man one probleme nutzen kann. gruss got      Also schön -) Zunächst mal: Jedes Bild braucht (1) eine Quelle, (2) eine Copyright-Legitimation, (3) im Zweifelsfall einen Beweis für diese Legitimation. Alles drei muss auf die Bildbeschreibungsseite. (Hier auf en-wiki gibt es dafür meist vorgefertigte Tag-Templates.) Dabei gilt Wikipedia selbst nicht als Quelle, sondern du musst die Quelle dokumentieren, wo der andere Wikipedianer das Bild ursprünglich her hat.   Dann musst du unterscheiden zwischen drei Typen von Legitimationen: ein Bild kann sein:  *(a) völlig frei (``public domain``, ``gemeinfrei``), d.h. es besitzt überhaupt niemand ein Copyright dafür. Das gilt im Allgemeinen nur für ganz alte Bilder (wenn der ursprüngliche Autor mehr als 70 Jahre tot ist). Im Zweifelsfalle musst du dafür einen Beweis liefern können.  *(b) unter freier Lizenz (z.B. ``GFDL`` oder ``cc-by-sa``). Das heißt, es gibt jemanden, dem das Bild gehört, aber derjenige hat es der Allgemeinheit zur freien Verfügung gestellt. Das gilt z.B. für Bilder, die ein anderer Wikipedianer selbst gemacht und dann hochgeladen hat, oder für manche (aber längst nicht alle) Bilder auf Flickr. Bei Flickr muss man immer auf die Copyright-Symbole achten, da muss ``cc-by-sa`` stehen. Auch hierfür musst du gegebenenfalls einen Beweis liefern können, also in der Regel einen genauen Link auf die Seite, wo der andere die Lizenz gegeben hat. *(c) sog. ``fair-use``: Das heißt, das Bild gehört jemandem, aber du hast einen besonderen Grund, warum du es sogar ohne seine Zustimmung für besondere Zwecke verwenden darfst. Das gilt in der Regel dann, wenn du in einem Artikel über das Bild selbst sprechen willst. Z.B. wenn du einen Artikel über ein Gemälde schreiben willst, darfst du ein Bild des Gemäldes hochladen. In der Regel sind alle Bilder aus dem Bereich Film, Popmusik, Fernsehen, Comics usw. solche nicht-freien Bilder, die gehören immer den kommerziellen Verlagen oder Studios. Die zu benutzen, geht also immer nur mit besonderer Begründung (``fair use rationale``). Soweit verstanden?       : OK. Ab jetzt weiss ich schon. Kannst du jetzt auf mich gut achten. Ich habe das auch in mazedonische Wiki gelesen, aber kann sein dass ich nicht gut verstanden habe. wie ich gesagt habe, dachte ich wenn etwas von Wiki ist muss man nich die Quelle überwiesen.

innocuous,"`  Wow, you're hopeless.  Lets start with the trifles; you spelled ``necessarily`` wrong.  That doesn't give you much credibility.  The answer to your first question is no, whites from Liverpool speak Scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from South London, of course, but I don't see what that has to do with White South African English.  However, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  Most blacks from Boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from New Orleans.  Most blacks from both areas speak what's called African American Vernacular English (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in America.  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ``Mother Tongue English speakers``.  Do you mean L1 varieties?   I don't think my final statement is a violation of WP:OWN because I never said I own this article, nor did I ever think that.  I simply temporarily ``took it over``, if you will, to make it a better description of White South African English.  Those just happened to be the words I decided to use.  It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't. Finally, I will respond to your earlier comment that ``White South African English`` as a title for this article is ``simply racist``.  You really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don't understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That's quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's ``simply racist``.  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you're saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  Of course, I don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",BqiVZz

I think it's more the case that some people are too keen to ``babysit`` this article and try to make it grow, rather than let it breathe for a few weeks/months. I can understand editors being protective of articles they've just created for a while - but there comes a point when they have to stop ``updating`` with bloat and trivial sources, for the sake of it. An author can't visit a bookshop everyday with a new edition of their book to sell, nor can authors here expect to introduce new content daily unless the article is a genuine ``current event``. As far as I can tell, the notability of this article is low, perhaps questionable. However, I think it better that people leave the article as is for a while - better to have low notability than introduce elements that destroy it altogether and give grounds to AFD.

The term ``vigilante`` is commonly loaded with negative baggage, including high degrees of unlawfulness and vengeance. Perhaps some more moderate language is appropriate for the main article, such as ``organised resistance`` or ``people who have banded together for mutual protection``. That said, www.thefreedictionary.com defines ``vigilante`` as: ``One who takes or advocates the taking of law enforcement into one's own hands.``, which does seem appropriate in the present context.

The person you really want to move heaven and earth to get on board is , particularly if he drops off Arbcom at the end of the year and thus loses the inherent COI; he's one of the very few people with expert knowledge in both the internal workings of Wikipedia, and of current medical custom and practice.  :Some thoughts (possibly more to follow if I think of them): :#What does ``participation and advocacy`` actually mean in theory, and what will it mean in practice? If the project becomes a self-appointing group which parachutes en masse into contentious areas to sway block votes—or is perceived as such—it's likely to meet the same reception as that given to the East European Mailing List or the Article Rescue Squadron. :#How much input do you (plural) envisage this project as having over Wikipedia content? I can easily see it becoming a star chamber which determines Wikipedia's or Wikimedia's party line on contentious medical issues—even if that's not the intention of the founders—and in that case, it will become a prime target for various cultists and cranks. If it has (for instance) twenty active members, I could easily imagine Narconon, the TMers or the big pharma companies getting enough of a foothold to stage a coup. :#What mechanisms will you have for reconciling ``anyone can edit`` and ``keep out the lunatics``? How do you handle the hypothetical situation where a dozen crystal therapists or reiki healers sign up, in sufficient numbers to start swaying votes? :#This thread is only touching one worm from a vigorously wriggling can. How will ``radical transparency`` react with the situation where identifiable individuals are citing each other as examples of sufferers from mental illnesses? When someone uploads an identifiable photo of themselves to illustrate a particular topic, and by the time they sober up and try to take the image down the Free Culture hardliners at Commons have got their mitts on it and refuse to allow it to be deleted as a point of principle? When people are posting accusations of medical malpractice against identifiable medical practitioners? (All these things have actually happened.) :#Some people are already alluding to this on the talkpage; are you going to follow a Teach the Controversy doctrine or scientific orthodoxy? ``Encourage health care providers to use Wikimedia projects and to adopt the values of free culture and open access`` could easily be read as an open invitation to Reichians, chiropractors, ibogaine therapists, acupuncturists and other not-totally-disproven-but-undoubtedly-fringe people to say their piece. If the project is genuinely open to everyone working in health and medicine, it will likely become a free-for-all and the net result will just be that the arguments take place at one remove from the broader community, rather than on the talkpages as they do now. If you do adopt a ``party line`` and only accept contributions from people following medical orthodoxy (as I believe is the only morally responsible path to take), you're adopting a position that's fundamentally at odds with the WMF custom and practice of ``anyone can edit``. (``Anyone can edit`` is not actually written down anywhere in the WMF constitution, and although it appears on the main page and is listed in the executive summary at WP:FIVE it doesn't actually appear on any of the actual Five Pillars—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and you'd be astonished at how many of the people who cite WP:FIVE as if Larry Sanger carried it down from Mount Sinai on stone tablets, have never bothered actually to read them—but the idea has become so ingrained in the culture that any attempt to ditch it would meet with howls of protest from the Defenders Of The Wiki.) :#A biggie, which nobody appears to have mentioned: almost all the people you're looking to attract have a huge COI, and there doesn't appear to be any discussion of how you're going to handle this. If GlaxoSmithKline offers a dozen people on secondment to write medical articles full time, do you turn them away even though they're almost certainly better qualified to write on the topic than anyone currently active on Wikipedia? How about the National Health Service? How about the CCHR (who may be industrial-grade whackadoodles but are undoubtedly among the world's leading experts in current psychiatric and pharmacological practice)? How about the Followers of Christ? Who will decide who is and isn't a ``health care provider``, and once you open the door to some groups where do you draw the line and why? :#If this project gives ``official approval`` to medical articles, or a status which outside observers could reasonably construe as such, what are the liability issues if an article gives incorrect information which negatively impacts on someone's health? IANAL, but I believe that an oversight panel of this nature could well pull Wikipedia's medical coverage out of the S230 umbrella, and open the WMF up to virtually unlimited liability. Even if it's ultimately determined that S230 still applies, I very much doubt Jimmy Wales has any enthusiasm for that particular test case. :;Executive summary :I support the principle of a de facto regulatory body to monitor and improve Wikipedia's medical coverage, but because it will attract ferocious opposition and controversy, it can only work if you can get an explicit imprimatur from both Jimmy and Sue to overrule ``consensus`` if consensus is leading in inappropriate directions. Because this will make the project one of the most powerful bodies on the internet, a lot of thought needs to go into who can be a member and what the procedures should be for ejecting inappropriate people; until this issue is addressed it's likely the WMF will get cold feet about recognising the project and creating an explicit link which could jeopardise both goodwill and S230 immunity. If the WMF do recognise this project they're likely to insist on such strict controls that you'll find yourselves hamstrung from doing much, while if the WMF doesn't recognise this project it will probably be treated as an inappropriate canvassing group and its members ultimately banned from Wikipedia. –  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",cvjb1I

If you read the comments in the AFD you will see they are mainly to keep or strong keep the article.  Nevertheless the nominator has tried to make things difficult by issuing a sockpuppet investigation despite me admitting my fault and promising not to do it again.

Everyone who contributes at least something will earn a virtual commemorative medal, so if you haven't contributed anything bacon-related to Wikipedia, now's your chance. Contributions  up until the end of March 7th, but only for contributions that were done before the beginning of March. The extra week is provided for participants to report any last-minute contributions, and to allow for any contributions that require a timely process (such as a good article or DYK nomination) to go through.

The first photograph in the office: not only that the circumstance or reason for taking it is trivial (it was completely accidental) but there is no possibility of even establishing the original authorship.

In any case, even with that photograph, the circumstance and reasons were trivial; therefore not only that the original authorship cannot be established, it is also legally nonexistent. The third and the fourth photographs were taken by cousins, without any intent of establishing copyrights or authorships, and like in the first two cases almost accidentally (the third photograph taken in the park just because the camera was accidentally there and there was no special intent of taking that photograph or establishing authorship). The fourth one was under similar circumstance and without any desire to establish an authorship or copyright.

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karataş' group was based in Istanbul.[3]  this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a ``fact`` states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.  Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations.   This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.    In prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]  He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.        He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]  Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]  following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.  this is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",_UwANV

I know you have edited a previous post of mine to remove the uncivil chat between me and Kung Fu Man but it needs to be logged that his behaviour has been, at times, antagonistic. My first point (which you edited) was a bit OTT for a mediation case (which I made hastilly in retalliation) but there are some things that need to be said as Kung Fu Man has been treating this debate as in the same vain as a forum argument. I have written a little along these lines and I would appreciate it if you would leave it as it is. You'll find that the comments I made are not disparagaring and are simply there to make the point. My comments are justified, as a quick comparison between my and Kung Fu Man's replies will show how he frequently posts in an un-called for antagonistic manner.

Your rationale in this revert was ``It's important to have distinctive, aesthetically pleasing boxes to aid navigation``. Why is this important? The trend for years, ever since  was formalised, has been to move away from custom styling except where it provides some tangible benefit to the reader. Here, your chosen stying is arbitrary (there is nothing in the chosen colour scheme which relates any particular field of nanotech to its colour), distracting (the colours are bold and clash with the article body) and potentially damaging to article accessibility (whether by the letter of WP:ACCESS it is prohibited to change the colour of links or not, it is plainly not appropriate to do so on a whim). Lastly, ``aesthetically pleasing`` is in the eye of the beholder, and the general move to vanilla styling on sidebar templates strongly suggests that the defaults are aesthetically pleasing to a majority of editors.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",hujVqK

Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.  ::For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44  ::Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian.

Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)  ::Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.  ::Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.  ::Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.  ::Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.  ::In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new...

For example, the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever, does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article, and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.見学/迷惑 `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",XXiIoC

There is information in the lead which isn't found elsewhere in the article - this also can be sorted out later down the line.  :* Consistency  ::There are a few key issues here: ::* Selective ``team re-shuffles`` included - either include all of them or none, I'd question their inclusion. ::* Task outlines need to give a clear indication of what consitutes a win - eg. ``The team that makes the most profit wins`` ::* Minor point, but is it Tim or Timothy?   2 Factual accuracy  :All claims need to be backed up with sources - especially those with dubious authenticity (otherwise remove the claims): :* ``Sir Alan said that he chose Tim as the winner because of his likeness to his East End self.`` :* ``Sir Alan Sugar later admitted that Miriam probably didn't deserve to be fired at this point`` :* ``In reality, Paul Torrisi was fired before James Max.`` :* ``She is not allowed to apply for subsequent series of The Apprentice``  3 Coverage  :* Lacking a ``Reception`` section outlining how the series was received in the press, and any viewing ratings.  :* Perhaps include a ``Production`` section - if there are any reliable sources to get the info from. :* References to the American version of The Apprentice - are they really relevant here?  4 Neutrality  :Quite a few highly biased terms in here, just to pick a couple:  :* ``Saira's aggressive behaviour `` :* ``James because Sir Alan and the interviewers were not convinced of his dedication to work for Sir Alan (although he had the best CV of the four)``   5 Stability  :All fine here, the series aired three years ago so this isn't an issue.  6 Images  :No problems, the one image in the article has a valid Fair Use Rationale.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",tM_QZl
