innocuous,":::::I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.  :::::First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order,   :::::1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.    :::::Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).  :::::1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080  :::::They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.  :::::There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.  :::::When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.  :::::Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.    :::::The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ago as 1936 when television was broadcast in the 240 line 25 field progressive format (known in those days by the more correct term of 'sequential').    :::::Because of its American origins, European players and TV sets have not officially supported the format until relatively recently.  Early equipment either didn't support it at all, but if they did it was only because the internal circuitry was common to its American counterpart.  Although 24p has become a selling point in the last year or so (it's usually prominent on the box), it is of little value to Europeans because if they do import 24p Blu-Rays from America, practically all current output (if not all current ouptut) is region locked to Region A machines.  Selling 24p discs in Europe would be risky because many are likely to be returned as unplayable (on older equipment).",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",J9yWix
innocuous,", being from Peru doesn’t make your contributions to this article automatically POV. I think you’ve been trying to mediate on this issue from a neutral stance and your input is definitely appreciated it.  It seems to me, though, that Arafael is hardening his position and is unwilling to compromise.   I should also say that whether Arafel likes it or not.  A declaration of war of document is not needed to verify that Bolivia declared war on Chile.  It seems to me that Arafael is not well aware of Wikipedia’s policies. Therefore it’s highly advisable that he familiarizes himself with WP:V in order to have a well-rounded discussion here.   In any case, let me quote just quickly cite the relevant paragraph from WP:V.   The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true.     See. If Arafael was familiar with policies WP:V and WP:OR he would also know that sources such as Britannica, Encarta and several other online encyclopedias are, in fact, authoritative references thus reliable.  Lastly, I would like to inform anyone interested in this discussion that I'm requesing comments from third parties, in addition to a mediation request I just filed here;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2009-04-30/War_of_the_Pacific  And I have posted a message requesting input on the reliability of my sources here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Encarta.2C_Globalsecurity.org_and_Onwar.com  I have also asked whether the line The turning point of the war was the occupation of Lima on January 17, 1881, a humiliation the Peruvians never forgave compromises the neutrality of the source. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Noticeboard#is_Globalsecurity.org_a_Neutral_source.3F  Please notice that other reliable sources such as the New York Times also talk about humiliation in their reports.

Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

innocuous,"`    1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.  2) This is new. It's from Conason: ``Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments.`` Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.  3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: `` She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as ``harmless American citizens`` [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.`` Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent.   This quote is also troubling: ``Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing.`` Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this: ``Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.``  Whady'a say?  (Much more on this section later.)  4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.  5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are ``not as bright`` as men'? Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected.

innocuous,"`::Furthermore, your asserted: ``So 2 is not an absence of interference, but the sum of two interference patterns which are shifted 180°.`` That statement is not true. There are, at that stage in addition of pieces of equipment to the experiment, two groups of photon splits that have opposing polarizations, and the members of no pair of photon splits (or copies of wavefunctions, or however you want to verbally describe them), being oppositely polarized, cannot productively superimpose. Even if the discussion were to be carried on entirely in classical terms and there were no individual photons mentioned, it would be impossible to draw the equivalent to a classical picture of simple double-slit interference. A diagram of ordinary interference shows two diffraction patterns that are slightly out of phase along the x-axis of the detection screen. In this placement of the two light waves, there is productive physical interaction between the two waves. The result is one wave with maxima of different magnitudes. Walborn et al. designed their experiment to upset this productive interaction by giving the two waves of light (to put it in classical terms) opposing polarizations. DParlevliet claims that Walborn et al. are mistaken, and that interference between these two waves of light actually occurs. Furthermore, he asserts that there is not one interference-produced wave but two. It is unclear what light wave is interfering with what light wave in the case of the first wave, nor is it clear what light wave is interfering with what light wave in the case of the second light wave. Furthermore, it is not stated how, with all of these supposed interference waves being incident on the same area of a detection screen, experimenters could observe them to establish the existence of the real physical interactions that their theory predicts. It appears that from one light wave emerging from a light source two light waves are produced by the action of the double-slit diaphragm, that the two light waves are oppositely polarized by the two quarter-wave plates, by unspecified means each of those two light waves is divided, and finally there are four light waves. These four light waves interfere, two by two, producing two ``interference patterns which are shifted 180°,`` which are incident and superimposed on the same detection screen and are therefore obscured by each other. However, it has not been exlained how these two sets of presumed interference could ever be empirically confirmed.  ::We are forbidden from publishing independent research or assertions unsupported by research in peer-reviewed journals or other accepted sources.  ::Therefore I must insist on adequate evidence for your assertion quoted above.     `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",oxyKKL

innocuous,"`    It seems perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, so I will try to be helpful and explain WHY your last edit was vandalism.  First off, the description intro, the quality of the intro had been greatly increased, Naming McTaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section, hence there is no need for it. The description gave a better just of what B-thoery of time is a whole. Undoing this completely is therefore vandalism, ESPECIALLY if you don'y first talk about it in the talk page before editing.  Secondly, you removed 'description', you then deleted the description as in metaphysics, changed the better, updated version of the physics part, then moved it in the origin section. There really is nothing I can say about this, I have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?!....  Thirdly you removed this section: It is noted by Dean Zimmerman in 'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold' that A-theory is 'almost certainly a minority view among philosophers', while B-theory has 'achieved broad acceptance'.http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdf It seems you perhaps have a personal agenda, favouring A-theory therefore editing in favour of it, this is not allowed on wikipedia, and it is vital to keep a Neutral point of view. The above statement however, is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.  Finally, and on the most relevant side, you Craig information, it is an improvement that you have put the Craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section. However a lot of it is not quoted, rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. Such as...  ``The B-Theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory, namely, that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming, so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. The Buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world, since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality, but this is not the case with temporal becoming.`` You stated this outright. This is an OPINION of Craig's it should be demonstrated as such, I also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion.  In fact you have stated all of Craig's OPINIONS as fact.  If you want to make edits, please first discuss them in the talk page, and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not, and how it should be worded.

The group is best known for the songs ``Sugar Free`` and Beat Street feature song ``Beat Street Strut``. The name comes from Mtume' number-one R&B; hit ``Juicy Fruit``.   They debuted in 1983 with a single called ``Don't Cha Wanna`` and album Juicy. The album entered the charts following year.   In 1984, their song ``Beat Street Strut`` was released by Atlantic Records. The song appeared on the 1984 musical-drama film Beat Street and its gold-certified soundtrack. The song was moderately successful on Billboard Dance chart, peaking #46 in July 1984.   In 1985, Juicy recorded their second album It Takes Two, which features an answer record to ``Juicy Fruit`` called ``Sugar Free``. It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Black Singles chart and #45 on the UK pop chart, and was certified Gold. Another singles from the album include ``Nobody But You``, reaching number 59 on the R&B; chart.

Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens, without the knowledge of his wife, and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect.  :As the first wife of J. Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes, and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce, so angry she was against him, Joseph Smith changed his mind. It made J. Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules, which made the other male members angry at him. It end up as a polygamism rule, but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death. As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death, and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power.  :It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books, he was contacted by various members of masonics loges, and many of this church rituals, both sacred and profane, are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic orders'rituals. Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions, therefor the mormons books looks more, for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view, like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories, well known within other religious groups, than a religion in itself. Nothing in the mormon books is original, all is taken from somewhere else, often with quiet a unimaginativ mind.  :The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source, or even ressembling source, for all the tribes described there.  :Another correction to what some have earlier stated here: there is a hell in mormons theory.  :Only true mormon, true knights of the later days saints, and else being it since as most generations as possible, have access to heaven,(the upper part, nearest to God). The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members. And out of it is hell, for non mormon, who cannot access the other levels, and will never been able to be in the upper levels. It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching, and I heard it several times, by mormons priests, that there is no salvation for non mormon. Christian go to hell too, and none of the christian priests are recognized as such, nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone, and they teach that even the first apostles, those walking around Jesus Christ, were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there, until Jesus christ himself took to latin america, and baptised a bunch of by mistake-landed-there-hebrews, and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith.  :And thats the way the story goes.  :The foundator of the christian church is by definition unable to baptise others. Peter was spiritually impotent if we are to believe the mormonic song.  :A way one can undoubtly see the influence of freemasonry in the mormon church is their attribution of 1st and second degree of priesthood, like a copy-paste of hebraic traditions, with some dubious change into it.  :You are missing here also, the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons, clearly prevail: It is for exemple today teached, that the upper god, is a goddess, the wife of God, and higher than him, and that she cant be named, and very little is known about her because she is OH! so high and special. It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest, nor baptised, is that women are per birth closer to god than men, and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age, all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with... It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have, and thats why women must do other things in the mean time: like give birth to more mormons members, do the cleaning and make food, and play missionary 1½ year of their life just before getting married, as soon as they return from mission time. All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order, as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things, without risking having them asking certain questions, very up to date, very warms, and never answered by this church.  :There is of course nowhere in the mormon books where anyone could actually read exactly the thing stated above, but the",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",wnp995

innocuous,"`    a Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?  Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years.   The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.  To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.   In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of ``wet affairs,`` with ``wet`` meaning ``bloody.`` That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.  When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. ``Your hands are blood-stained too,`` Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.    As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself.   Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

They also took up a very small part of the total article, so the fact that you believe they were ``weighted heavily negative`` (whatever that means) would be irrelevant, even if it were true. In fact, the Salon article quoted directly from Kyle's own book. So if there is any concern over ``negativity``, then attribute it to the author of the book - the subject himself. But, in an article that is rapidly taking on the form of a ``testimonial`` or some kind of ``tribute page``, those inclusions met WP:BALANCE.

innocuous,"`    There are people I unequivocally despise. They lack morals, character, and honesty. They crush the remaining vestiges of democracy throughout the world. In case you can't tell, I'm talking about Mr. Jimbo Wales here. Let me cut to the chase: Wales says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does Wales need to monitor our library records? In classic sophist fashion, I ask another question in reply: Will Wales's shots to the heart of all that is wholesome buy him his long-sought victory for feckless charlatanism with its showy irreverence and glorification of all that is temeritous? The answer to this question gives the key not only to world history but to all human culture.  The next time someone says that Wales's analects enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness, look that person right in the eye and reply, ``Wales is profoundly hostile to religious tolerance, democracy, and the notion of a secular civil society.`` I plan to hone in on his faults with laser-like precision. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that when Wales says that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. It is our responsibility to ensure that he doesn't lock all the exits from our present state to the world of constructive reason. I state these facts only to give a bit of personal background as to why I fully intend to stop the Huns at the gate. That's the path that I have chosen. It's definitely not an easy path, but then again, Wales somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (society is supposed to be lenient towards impudent blackguards), distortions (his randy coalition is a respected civil-rights organization), and misplaced idealism (our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say ``predisadvantageously``.  Carnaptious primates are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the ``poeta nascitur, non fit`` that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that when I hear Wales say that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, I have to wonder about him. Is he entirely bitter? Is he simply being mawkish? Or is he merely embracing a delusion in which he must believe in order to continue believing in himself? If you were to ask that of Wales, he'd certainly fling a large barrage of insults in your direction instead of actually addressing the question. He has spent untold hours trying to make empty promises. During that time, did it ever once occur to him that his strictures are a mockery of all that is fair and equitable? Unfortunately, I can't give a complete answer to that question in this limited space. But I can tell you that his tracts are not our only concern. To state the matter in a few words, unlike everyone else in the world, he seriously believes that ethical responsibility is merely a trammel of earthbound mortals and should not be required of a demigod like him. Woo woooo! Here comes the clue train. Last stop: Wales. And that's it. Mr. Jimbo Wales is doing the very thing for which he criticizes others.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",SZ2gcB

The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity.

Narayan classic chronicle, on the adventures  of a school going boy, named Swami, and his friends, Rajam and Mani, in the sleepy and picturesque town of Malgudi. Narayan creates a vivid, practical and amazingly accurate picture of his brainchild, the fictional town of Malgudi, so accurately does he write it, it seems as if Narayan was himself present at the place where this epic story occurs.   R.K.Narayan ,is at the top of his form, lucidly, and carefully supplying even the minutest details of every occasion, whether it be the formation of a cricket team, Swami’s feeling when he is unable to solve a problem regarding Fractions, or his insatiable need to have a hoop, Narayan gets it right every single time. He rightly depicts the emotions of a boy, about to enter his adolescence, and puts it on paper with such, fluency; it’s hard to put the book down once you get past the first page. His depiction of the scenes, from the swadeshi movement to the cricket match, and from the enemity between two persons, to how they become the bestest of friends is unparalleled in Indian literature.   This is a book that makes it look as if there nothing as interesting in the world as life in a village. After all those books that tell you about life in a city, and rediscovering it, this books comes as a breather. The book, first published in 1935, rightfully describes the pre-independence India, with the Police Superintendent being a civil servant, and his family enjoying the cream off the pie in the small village. For children, who too want to run out of the house and start their “own cricket team and challenge the world” like Narayan’s lead character Swami, this book is non-stop entertainment. Classic scenes like a boy’s excitement to see his sibling for the first time, or the heroic way in which Swami catches a thief, or the feeling of helplessness when your best buddy goes away…for ever…make this book a milestone in Narayan’s career.   With excellent illustrations from R.K.Laxman, the characters come back to life in front of us, and we just sit, mesmerized by the beauty of this breath-taking odyssey, as we set out with Narayan, along with Swami and his Friends to take a bird’s eye view of the amazing, but surprisingly full of surprises town of Malgudi. As per my view, this book by far, proves to be more of a stress reliever for me, and trust me, this book makes me fall in love with village-life, taking me past the Sarayu river, down the Trunk road, and into the Bombay Anand Bhavan making my mouth water to have a bit of those divine sweets it made. Narayan proves to be a great cricket fan, rightfully spelling (through Swami’s voice, of course) ‘Willard Junior as ‘Vilord June-ear’.

I argued that the biggest challenge facing journalists in the region is a lack of freedom and cited, among other examples, the case of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photojournalist who was raped, tortured and murdered by Iranian officials after she was arrested for taking photographs outside the Evin prison in Tehran. To his credit, the host and chief press officer, Shahab Mossavat, did not interrupt or silence me. He called my comments ``offensive`` to Iran but pointed out that I was given free rein to say what I wished by Press TV. He then steered the conversation toward obstacles confronted by journalists in Israel.``   Thus the author demonstrates that Press TV let him criticize the Iranian government, which contradicts the criticism from the article.

innocuous,"`  ::Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: ``All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment.`` In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12.   ::Brunton's beginning point is that: ``The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance.``   ::I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is ``a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks`` is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The ``spiritual bypass`` is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ.   ::So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case.

Rather than try to use Wikipedia articles as refs for Wikipedia articles, which leads to a bootstrapping problem, it is better to go to the other article and then have a look though its refs and see if any are suitable to use in the first article. One thing to be aware of is that because Wikipedia is now ten years old that in some cases unreferenced information taken from it has been used in other articles and websites and then those have been used as refs for the original Wikipedia article, again creating a ``bootstrap`` problem of circular referencing. That way incorrect information can be widely spread and seemingly well referenced.  :As far as Aviation transponder interrogation modes goes, if all the information has been reincorporated back into SSR then I think it should be redirected back into SSR and not left out there.

This instrument,   that cost to you and me and to all  taxpayers  2 Billions of dollars is supposed to look for antimatter created in the Big Band . This project was proposed by nobel Prize  physicist  Samuel Ting many years ago, it was controversial and several time Congress tried to cancel the program but could not overcome the lobbying by all the scientists  involved in the project. In the same piece NPR interviewed Professor Gregory Tarle , a physics professor who  said  'This project was a tremendous expenditure of money that was not justified....while the AMS was originally planned to search for primordial  antimatter, recent research show that that there is no way that it will find any``.          This physicist is from the University of   Michigan    and I am sure, people working with  Ting or other scientists  who were on the salary to built the machine , considered this man a kook, a subversive and tried to discredit him in any way.

Do you think that when you go to a professor who is the recipient of  a grant on a specfic subject and you tell  him that the subject he is studying has some alternatives and that he is basically studying an old theory and there are alternative ones, that professor will just tell you that you are great and that   you deserve a piece of the pie?

In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, ``I've always thought so,`` to which Bukharin allegedly replied: ``Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?`` What ``they,`` or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact ``inappropriate for publication`` and decree that it be ``kept secret.`` In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the ``exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe`` and ``the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages``; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism ``owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses.`` Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar ``'tenacity' in struggle`` and a highly revolutionary disposition. ``Generally speaking,`` she concluded, ``I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities.`` Stalin's response was an order to ``keep absolutely quiet.`` Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition`` (pgs. 245–246)  :* ``All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the ``great leaders of democracy and socialism`` came from ``the best representatives of the Jewish world.`` Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and ``this fact`` was ``another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,`` and that Lenin had always contrasted ``what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character.`` (p. 163)  :* ``And in 1965, all archival documents relating to Lenin's Jewish grandfather were ordered ``removed without leaving any copies.`` (pg. 338)    `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",BojqM9

innocuous,"`  Wow!  I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)  In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.  As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.  The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.  This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, ``garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...``  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into `` a big, stinking heap``.  Truly, as the news media warned today: ``Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!``  The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:  ``Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out.`` - Jason Scott ``. . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts.`` - SummerFR  Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:  ``Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.  In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.  I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.  Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.``   Nuf said.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",6RKrNU

innocuous,"`   Penis envy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.  Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.  In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).  The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).  In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.  For girls:      * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.     * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.     * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.     * She develops a sexual desire for her father.     * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.     * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.     * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.     * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)     * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.  The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.  A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.  Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gender role.  While fashionable for a number of decades, the concept of penis envy is no longer regarded as a serious one by some modern psychoanalysts[1]. [edit] Criticisms of Freud’s theory [edit] Within psychoanalytic circles  Although popular in the early twentieth century when the theory was initially floated, Freud’s theories regarding psychosexual development (in particular the phallic stage and the Oedipal crisis) have been discredited[citation needed]. Theories by other influential psychoanalysts, such as Erik Erikson and Jean Piaget are widely believed to be more broadly accurate and applicable to child psychological development. Having said this, Freud’s theory continues to be relevant in some theoretical circumstances, and is of such historical significance that it continues to find its way into psychoanalytical teachings. Most of Freud's theories are still taught as part of curriculum in almost all universities and academic circles. [edit] Feminist criticisms  A significant number of critics, activists and feminists, have been highly critical of penis envy as a concept and psychoanalysis as a discipline, arguing that the assumptions and approaches of the psychoanalytic project are profoundly patriarchal, anti-feminist, and misogynistic and represent women as broken or deficient men. Karen Horney—a German psychoanalyst who also placed great emphasis on childhood experiences in psychological development—was a particular advocate of this view. She asserted the concept of ``womb envy`` to challenge the idea of penis envy.  A small but influential number of Feminist philosophers have worked within Psychoanalysis (see Psychoanalytic feminism), including Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous who operate within a Post-Structuralist Feminist tradition inspired by Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida. Juliet Mitchell—another Feminist theorist—attempted to reconcile Freud's thoughts on psychosexual development with Feminism and Marxism by declaring his theories to be simply observations of gender identity under capitalism. She proposed a shift to Marxist models of rearing children which would result in the dismantling of the Electra complex and the Oedipus complex and the avoidance of penis envy. [edit] Male penis envy “  I worked with Freud in Vienna. We broke over the concept of penis envy. He thought it should be limited to women.  ”     — Woody Allen, Zelig  Unrelated to penis envy as referred to in psychoanalysis, is ``small penis syndrome`` which is the anxiety of thinking one's penis is too small - even though it isn't. [2] The female equivalent is ``small breast anxiety`` which is a woman's discontentment about her breast size.  The media attention given to penis size and some women being vocal in their penis size preferences have led some men to state their anxiety over their penis size. Television shows such as Sex and the City and Ally McBeal popularised the penis size issue when characters in these TV shows stated their preference for well-endowed men over more modestly-endowed men. Also, in the 1977 film Annie Hall, Woody Allen's character, upon hearing the question asked by the title character about penis envy, replied that he ``was one of the few males that suffered from it.``  Men can underestimate the size of their own penises, see Perceptions of penis size. Also, there are wide differences between flaccid and erect states which can be misleading as in 'growers' and 'showers.'

innocuous,"`    :Katsam, Im a Falun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to say, i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view. Many people see Falun Gong in different ways, some criticize it and some other people practice it, youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it. Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body, there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Mr. Li.  :The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of ``Truth Benevolence Forbearance`` and letting go of attatchments, all this is substantiated by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong, gradually cleans your body and evolves many things for you. A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort, we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no ``churches`` or enrollment sistems, people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want.   :You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want, There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioners too. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who teaches the excercises to new people and coordinates the group practice. Mr. Li is often reffered to as the ``master`` by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way.  :According to our point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed, not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong.  :About the persecution, our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioners in China that the government decided to ``supress`` them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Comunist ideology. Supression or persecution, however its called, something is happening. Some other people may deny it, the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on. You can identify the practitioners at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask, true FG practitioners dont lie, if they dont want to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whatever they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, which is torture. If you want to legally forbid something, you have to have a reason for it, so if you dont have it, you come up with it.  :Everything i just said is the FG practitioners point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page, perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view, again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it.

That in Starčević's political career the term ``Slavosrb`` was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main ``Slavosrbs`` were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called ``Khuen Serbs``- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally ``awoke`` as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the ``Slavosrbs`` tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology.

I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.  Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote ``well sourced`` stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not ``well sourced``.

Seeing that the edit warring has continued once the DRN was closed I feel it necessary to keep an eye on this talk page, and request the assistance of administrators to keep this conflict under control as needed. I would suggest all involved actually read WP:UNDUE, specifically this passage - ``If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia, regardless of whether it is true or you can prove it, [...]. In this situation, the opinion of Sayeed is in the vastly limited minority, so it does not belong on Wikipedia.   Help resolve disputes! `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",BBnP5v

These are my questions:  1. With other cables I've seen, the MALE end is the one where there is a center pin or set of pins plugging into a jack where there's a receiving hole in the center, whether or not there's also a female-like sheathe of some kind around the connector pins. For examples: coaxial cables (F, RCA, etc.), DIN cables (S-video, some older rounded computer cable plugs, etc.), ``D`` plugs, and DVI. Of course there would be others, too. Okay, so the one with the pins has been male, while the one that the pins plug into is female, even if the one with the holes fits into an outer casing that the one with the pins is in.  Well, that's been true up until HDMI came out, apparently. Look at HDMI and what the industry is calling its ``female`` and ``male`` ends. They're calling the end with the pin row the female end, and the end with the slot that the row of pins plugs into the ``male`` end (and keep in mind that the end with the bar of pins is also the end with a female-like casing around it, just as I pointed out above, yet those above like that are still MALE; yes, the slotted end of HDMI sort-of plugs into the sheathed-like end, but then so do several of those others I mentioned above which were always called FEmale, because what really counts has been the PINS, not the edges. So why isn't HDMI's PIN end the one called MALE like the others?  2. Who is it in the industry that first insisted that this slotted end of HDMI should be called backwards of other kinds of plugs, the ``male`` end, and that the end with the pins in the middle should be called backwards of other connectors, the ``female`` end? Who from the industry started that and sort-of ``dictated`` to encyclopedias, etc. that this is ``how it's supposed to be,`` and what made them the supposed ``authority``?

Using the national team parameter also makes the justification for using one flag icon in athlete infoboxes a lot more obvious, too, which has been a running battle for the last five or six years.  When an athlete is a national team member, he or she clearly represents his or her country in international competition, and the case for flag icon usage is very strong.  The flip side of that, when we have a notable swimmer who never competed in the Olympics or other international events, say a notable college swimmer, or channel swimmer, or national champion, then we should use the ``nationality`` parameter and no flag icon.  Among American swimmers, I don't think are more than 2 or 3 dozen notable swimmers who fall in this latter group.  When I'm done cleaning up the Canadian Olympic swimmers, I'm going to revisit the instructions and other template documentation for Infobox swimmer, and provide and example Infobox completed with all of the usual options in use.

innocuous,"`  Hello.  I'm aware of that but I don't want to edit posts and get blocked again hence I'd like an advisor/mentor to guide me on here first so once I post it I wouldn't have any trouble.  For example ````. I wish to edit the page ``Muslim conquest of Persia`` and add these sections to them as they are historical facts.    According to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) ``Zoroastrian`` families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.  Some historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.  It is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.    Babak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.  Caliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).

For the sake of its inclusion in the nuclear safety article, how would you feel about reversing the order of the two clauses, such that the relevant information is presented but not immediately negated, e.g. 'Although there is no way to guarantee that any reactor will be designed, built and operated correctly [or perhaps 'safely'], the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed safer (but generally untested) reactor designs.' Perhaps that last parenthetical phrase might be refined as well; obviously testing is done in research environments, but what the sentence is trying to say (which is clearer in the report's context) is that the designs haven't been commercially deployed, correct?

innocuous,"`   I reverted your edit because you just destroyed the continuity of that section.   As for your claims, I don't see any standards/templates set for what a player's season recap should include. I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information, and certaintly not enough for individual players. I think those articles are poorly done, and I'm not interested in improving them. I do not like the prose-style recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of ``In week X of the XXXX season, Player X did this and that against Team X in a XX-XX win/loss...`` For the longest time that's how Drew Brees' 2009 season (a great individual season that deserves better writing) read. It still has some of those problems.   The way I've done it gives it structure. You don't have to repeat who the opponent was, what week it was or the result. And these are NFL players. They'll play 16 games a year, 20 at the most with the playoffs. I'm not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games. It's a small sample. Write a sentence or two for each game and you're talking 16-40 sentences at the most. Hardly creates a long section.  I really suggest you look at Denard Robinson (Michigan QB) and his current season recap. He has sub-sections with lots of text for each individual game this year. And you know what, I don't see anyone changing it or complaining about it. It doesn't bother me. While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players (so don't get worried), I have to say their info is written pretty well and it's sourced and everything. That much info on one game is pretty crazy, but you know what, where are the restrictions on space?  Come on man, this is the internet. We're not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia. The space is there. I'll make sure to refrain from any further mention of team-oriented things like ``going on a bye week``, but other than that, the text has been about Ben, so it's on topic and referenced. I don't see the big deal, and I can't say I'm seeing other people questioning it besides yourself. I didn't even start Manning's 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having, but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today. Looks fine to me. And since there's been free reign given on these kind of sections, again, I don't see the problem.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",6SdVDV

For instance, see Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris who are considered hostile toward religion generally, but generally not considered bigots generally or antisemites specifically.  ``Religious antisemitism,`` however, is by definition a type of bigotry.  To say ``religious antisemitism`` is ``hostility toward Judaism,`` thus, is overbroad.  :Also, isn't the main point of religious antisemitism that it's a cover for regular old antisemitism?  Otherwise, you'd think ``antisemitism`` would be the wrong word.  Someone who just hates the religion of Judaism more than is normal would presumably have a different label than ``antisemitism,`` if it didn't really didn't stem from any antipathy toward the Jewish people.  So for that reason too, I'd think the definition should focus on Jews as a religion, like the definition of anti-semitism, rather than including criticism of the religion itself even when not related to any traditional anti-semitism. `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",nup24Q

innocuous,"I find that a lot of people refer me to the following on this issue.  This is a quote not my own writting.  I am sure that some of it could be valuable for clarifying exactly what is being talked about in this section as well as show why Christians get upset.  Statements from the Talmud  The Talmud is considered one of the most important books of the Jewish religion. It wields a great influence on Jews, surpassed only by that of the Torah, the work that contains the principal books of the Old Testament. The Talmud contains the doctrines, laws, and commentaries on Judaism made by the most expressive rabbis throughout History.  The following are some of the statements contained in the Talmud:  ・. The souls of Jews have the privilege of being part of God himself. The souls of the other peoples of the earth come from the devil and are similar to those of animals ....   ・. As they await the coming of the Messiah, Jews live in a state of continuous war with the other peoples. When the victory is definitive, the peoples will accept the Jewish faith, but it is only the Christians who will not participate in this grace. On the contrary, they will be completely annihilated, because they descend from the devil ....  ・. Only the Jews are men; the other peoples are no more than types of animals. The dog is worth more than the non-Jews. The non-Jews are not only dogs, but asses. The souls of the non-Jews come from the impure spirit and the souls of Israel come from the spirit of God.  ・. The non-Jews were only created to serve the Jews day and night, without deviating from their service.  ・0. It is prohibited for the Jew to praise the learning or virtue of a Christian.  ・1. It is not just to use mercy toward enemies ....  ・4. The Jews can be hypocritical with the non-Jew ....   ・6. God granted all power over the goods and the blood of other peoples to the Jews.  ・7. A non-Jew who robs a Jew, even should it be an alms, should be killed. On the contrary, it is permitted for Jews to do evil to non-Jews. To despoil a pagan [that is, a non-Jew] is allowed ....  ・9. You can deceive an outsider and practice usury against him ....  ・1. Whoever loves a Christian would hate his own creator ....  ・3. Annihilate the best of the non-Jews. Take the life of the most honest of the idolaters.  ・4. If a pagan falls into a pit, we should cover the pit with a stone and try to prevent any measure that he might employ to get out. When we see him fall into a river or in danger of death, we should not save him. Maimonides counsels giving death wounds to every non-Jew when this lies within our powers. It is just to exterminate every heretic [that is, non-Jew] with your own hand; whoever sheds the blood of the impious offers a sacrifice to God ....  典hose who deny the teaching of Israel, particularly the followers of the Nazarene, should be killed and it is always a good work to execute them; if this is not possible, we should try to cause their deaths. But whoever kills a soul of Israel will be judged as if he had killed the entire world ....・(apud H.

Having said that, I don't think G2bambino's incorrect when he says that the lion could represent the Crown.  Frankly, the artist could have intended both, and a more sophisticated view of the poster would suggest a number of additional interpretations.  But the Crown allusion is a lot less obvious, and Lonewolf is probably right when he says it should be cited. The description of the image is sourced on the image description page, as per Wikipedia norms.  In my opinion, the description is uncontroversial and obvious, and does not require any unusual attribution (suggesting that it is the opinion of the Minneapolis library) or removal of the word ``Britain``.  However, if anyone disagrees and thinks Royalguard11's original image description goes too far, feel free to get consensus for a change here on the talk page. My own view is that rather than insisting that the lion doesn't necessarily represent Britain (which, fairly or unfairly, comes across like an attempt at making a point in retaliation to Lonewolf's revision), efforts would be better spent seeing if we can find any source for the Crown interpretation.  This poster was mass produced, it is held by a number of archives and libraries, and I believe that it has been reproduced numerous times.

In this case the Wikipedia:Controversial_blocks page.  The copy below has emphasis provided where the admins in this situation are failing:   Wikipedia:Controversial blocks From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  While blocking IP addresses responsible for anonymous, clear-cut vandalism is routine, many other uses of IP and username blocks are contentious. Where consensus proves elusive, such blocks are damaging to the community.  The most controversial blocks are blocks of:  * suspected ``sock puppets`` or ``reincarnations`` of banned users * logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions,' regardless of the reasoning for the block * blocks made under the disruption provision of the blocking policy. * blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.  Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for | controversial blocks is:  # Check the facts with care. # Reread' appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy. # If possible, contact other administrators informally to be sure there are others who agree with your reasoning. The administrators' noticeboard, IRC and email are effective tools for this. # Place the block, exercising due care in the wording of the ``reason``  message, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked. # Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies. # Be willing to discuss the block with other Wikipedians. Such discussion usually takes place either on the blocked user's talk page, or the administrators' noticeboard (the latter especially in those cases where it was already raised there).  Block wars, in which a user is repeatedly blocked and unblocked, are extremely harmful. They are a source of frustration and disappointment to many seasoned Wikipedians and tend to encourage further bad behavior on the part of the blocked user. Avoid them. Instead, discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensus.  If no consensus has emerged after several respected Wikipedians have reviewed the matter, the user should be left unblocked. `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",VMv3eA

I just don't think removing that whole paragraph is the best solution. I want to condense it to just the main points, leaving certain details for further discussion in the body. Here's what I propose so far:  :The Six Day War or June War..., also known as the 1967 Arab-Israeli war or the Third Arab-Israeli War, was fought between 5 June and 10 June, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt [then the United Arab Republic, UAR], Jordan, and Syria. At the war's end, Israel had seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.  :After the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt agreed to the stationing of a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure compliance with the armistice agreement and prevent raids across the border . On 4 November 1966, Syria signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt. Nine days later, Israel attacked the city of as-Samu in the Jordanian occupied West Bank in response to raids from the fedayeen group Fatah. King Hussein of Jordan criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt for failing to come to Jordan's aid and ``hiding behind UNEF skirts`` [I checked Oren p. 135 and there's no mention of this on that page; please help double check source and find reference - possible later printing is different, I have 2003 first edition].  :On 14 May 1967, Nasser began sending Egyptian forces into the Sinai Peninsula. Two days later he requested and obtained the withdrawal of UNEF from Egyptian territory. Israel rejected a proposal to restation UNEF on its side of the border. Egyptian forces replaced UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Between 18 and 20 May Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered as a cassus belli, or justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on 22-23 May. On 1 June, Israel formed a National Unity Government by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched Operation Focus, a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six Day War.  I think following this, since the lede really only mentions the war between Israel and Egypt, there should be a brief discussion of the Jordan and Syria fronts, as well. With this slimmer version, it should be possible to fit that in, at least briefly. Let me know what you think.   `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",BWIObn

Why the term greek in anal sex is not considered by wikipedia a slur? The described reasons about having anal sex before wedding are relevant for muslims, not christians, if you have any sense of reality (and credibility)  man, what are you talking about? greece is of course comparably eastern with respect to west europe.. its history is rooted in east, as a race greek nation is genetically similar to turks, and christianity does not mean the west automatically.. this is not the page to discuss where greece belongs.. and any sense of reality and credibility offers that anal sex is forbidden by majority of sects of all monotheistic religions.. don't try to reflect all christians are welcoming anal sex, while all muslims are completely against it, there are muslim sects who don't condone anal sex...     For women, pleasure is derived from anal intercourse because the rectum shares a wall with the vagina and therefore shares some of the nerve endings associated with sexual pleasure.  This is wrong anatomically and factually  most women do not find anal sex pleasurable, according to surveys by Kinsey and others.  Any statement to the contrary should be quantified somehow.  : The entire opening section of this article does not have a neutral POV.  Rather, it verges on arguments in favor of anal sex and clearly favors a male's perspective.  This seems to violate the official NPOV stance.  : Claiming that ``most women do not find it pleasurable`` is POV and unverifiable. What is verifiable is that heterosexual couples do indeed practice it (survey mentioned in 4th link below), and that some females find it pleasurable and can achieve orgasm. The presense of nerve endings in the areas described is also verifiable.  ::It isn't really unverifiable, most women do not enjoy anal sex as is shown in consistent studies.  Whether that is based on anatomical reasons or social reasons is not really important to whether or not it is a fact.  It could be mentioned that most women do not enjoy anal sex, but some do.  It should also be mentioned that many heterosexual couples do engage in anal sex (and if anyone doesn't understand how most women can dislike anal sex and then a large number of them can participate in it, they don't know very much about women).  ::: Let's see some of those ``consistent studies.``    If the wording is the main issue under debate, then why not simply say that women can find anal sex pleasurable, as opposed to categorically stating we do or don't, because that's more a matter of preference than anything else.  GO TO: http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/?article=faq&refid;=125 ON ANAL SEX Read About the Dangers of Anal Sex.  We probably shouldn't include statements so general such as ``women like/don't like``. It would be better to state that ``this agrees with the majority of women, as revealed by surveys``.     http://www.slate.com/id/2126643/  According to data released earlier this year by the Centers for Disease Control, the probability of HIV acquisition by the receptive partner in unprotected oral sex with an HIV carrier is one per 10,000 acts. In vaginal sex, it's 10 per 10,000 acts. In anal sex, it's 50 per 10,000 acts. Do the math. Oral sex is 10 times safer than vaginal sex. Anal sex is five times more dangerous than vaginal sex and 50 times more dangerous than oral sex.   Other useful academic data is also available on the PDF link within the article.   :I don't think there has ever been any discension here that anal sex is a riskier activity then vaginal sex which is riskier then oral sex. This is a well accepted fact, supported by organisations like the WHO etc. However, this does not mean anal sex is bad or should be banned. If you claim otherwise then you should also support banning all sexual activity. Or hey why not just ban all contact between people? Nor does it mean people having anal sex are at more risk then people having vaginal sex. Someone having protected anal sex is likely to be at far lower risk then someone having unprotected vaginal and probably even oral sex.

Of course there are roussillonese who may consider themselves catalan without stopping feeling french... I'm just saying that there are no references of studies or scholars (apart that GREC article) to back the sentence in the lead of the article: ``Other Catalan-speaking people from the Pays Catalan in southern France, Andorrans or Valencians are sometimes included in a Catalan ethnic group``. That sentence is so freely included in wikipedia is just doesn't fit. We could also said that 3/4 of the spaniards may ``also be included in a Almoravid ethnic root``... I'm sorry, but that is just too POVish.  Let me copy/paste here the first paragraphs of the ``Explanation of the neutral point of view section`` in Wikipedia:Neutral point of view:  *``The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting verifiable perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources. The policy requires that where multiple or conflicting perspectives exist within a topic each should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as ``the truth``, in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view, or some sort of intermediate view among the different views, is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions.``  *``The neutral point of view is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject: it neither endorses nor discourages viewpoints. As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy on the grounds that it is ``POV``. Article content should clearly describe, represent, and characterize disputes within topics, but without endorsement of any particular point of view. Articles should provide background on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular; detailed articles might also contain evaluations of each viewpoint, but must studiously refrain from taking sides.``  So, this said, again, I'm not against including that some sources claim the other regions to have some degree of Catalanity, but, as the guideline states ``Articles should provide background on who believes what and why``. So, my addition that is only the GREC who includes all territories as catalan is correct and, even, necessary in order to let ``Readers [...] to form their own opinions``. The same way the article should include sources to back that some people consider all territories as catalan, it should also include sources that some others don't.  Do we agree on this?

innocuous,"`    You are correct in pointing out that in swing the pendulum bob does not pass over the point the pendulum bob hangs above when it is not swinging. (Actually, the image on the right, that I manufactured and uploaded about a year ago, shows precisely that.) So the sampling point would have to be the point during the swing where the velocity of the pendulum bob relative to the Earth is greatest. (Alternative formulation: the point during the swing where the angle between the pendulum wire and the plumb line is smallest)  As you point out there is a range where separation between ``precession frequency`` and ``swing frequency`` is meaningless. So it is better to keep the explorations in the range where the swing frequency is much higher than the rotation frequency.  The rate of change of direction of the pendulum bob is not constant, it is proportional to the velocity of the pendulum bob with respect to the rotating system, and I want a solution to the equation of motion that incorporates that. In the image the successive swings aren't sections of a circle: close to the extremal points the curvature is close to zero, the lines curve strongest where the velocity is largest.  I know differential equations for damped harmonic oscillators, and how solving that kind of equations is facilitated by the relation eit = cos(t) + isin(t) (I'm reproducing from memory here, so I may have a detail wrong.) In the differential equation for a damped harmonic oscillation the dampening force is parallel to the direction of the velocity, so I take it that a force perpendicular to the direction of the velocity is represented as an imaginary factor.  |  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",hkqsiA

Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.  The basis for usage of the term is completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople.  A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now ``Greek islands`` are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated ``Greek`` are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.

There are a number of possible reasons you might think the above quote was unacceptable, including (1) you think I was threatening to abuse GAR to pursue a personal vendetta rather than to improve the encyclopedia; (2) you think CurtisNaito's article edits are awesome and for me to criticize them constitutes a personal attack; (3) you think what I said constituted a threat and regardless of its merit it created a hostile editing environment; (4) you think it violated some policy I am not aware of regarding off-wiki drafts or some such... (I'm going to stop there.) :If (1): As I have already clarified, the GA criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate GA status, or reassessed. CurtisNaito's track record of OWNership and edit-warring indicates that the former is impossible, leaving the latter option. Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick. :If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks. (Note that I don't actually think this is why you blocked me. I'm grabbing at straws.) :If (3): You may be right, but look what I have had to deal with: CurtisNaito has requested four times in the last five months, on both ANI and ArbCom, that I be site-banned for disagreeing with his edits, even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too. If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked. :If (4): Tell me the policy. I won't violate it again. I also won't appeal the block, though, since I've been here too long for ignorance of the rules to be a valid excuse. : ()",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",7BQ1rk

innocuous,"`    Hi, ED.  Thanks for providing those references.  I'm sorry these conversations have gotten so combative-probably both sides could be more cooperative.  You clearly know a lot about physics, and there's no reason to doubt you're an experienced researcher, so I think these disagreements must be somehow based on misunderstandings.  Since there are some subtle issues being discussed, maybe everyone's just butting heads because of miscommunications.  Thanks again for the references-they help immensely.  I don't have any of those texts on hand, but I can look them up tomorrow, and I do have a few others.  After reviewing Resnick/Halliday/Krane, French, Goldstein, and Marion Thornton, one in particular (Marion-Thornton) seems to describe the relevant issues clearly.  First of all, in the section on Newtonian mechanics, it mentions ``Galilean invariance`` and the ``principle of Newtonian relativity.``  Then, in the chapter on special relativity, we find  The basis of relativity theory is contained in two postulates.  but shortly thereafter,  Postulate I, which Einstein called the ``principle of relativity,`` is the fundamental basis for the theory of relativity.  Postulate II, the law of propagation of light, follows from Postulate I if we accept, as Einstein did, that Maxwell's equations are fundamental laws of physics.  So I think these disagreements have been based on an issue of perspective.  If one knows nothing except the principle of relativity, then the second postulate is necessary-indeed, since Newtonian mechanics satisfies the principle of relativity, that principle alone can't lead to SR.  That's why Einstein included the 2nd postulate.  However, if we accept E&M;, or the fact that massive particles don't accelarate linearly forever with a constant force (mentioned by French), or indeed any of the abounding evidence that there's a ``speed limit`` in the universe, then the full structure of SR can be derived from only the principle of relativity.  Do you think that's a reasonable understanding of things?  If so, maybe we can all work together to find a way to explain things in the article.  I'd be happy to discuss things further.

You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that ``NPOV``   ::Thanks for the ``friend``, nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of ``pushing my delusions``.   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that ``all`` ``mainstream`` jewish groups, including ``secular`` groups ``strongly`` oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who ``all`` the ``mainstream`` jewish groups are, and what degree of ``opposition`` is ``strong``.  Can you really not see this simple truth? ::Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs ``vulnerable jews`` are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were ``vulnerable`` to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches ``vulnerable jews``. ::It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers ``strongly oppose`` DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be ``strongly opposed`` to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same. ::Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article ``christianity`` is there a section labeled ``incompatibility with paganism`` and ``a belief that is incompatible with paganism`` and ``all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity``?   Do we see ``incompatibility with catholicism`` in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete. ::What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called ``Jews for Jesus`` and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would ``Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish`` be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.

(context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

Almost all have NRHP text/photo set PDF documents included, and if they don't it is not for failing to try (the only articles that don't have those PDFs are the NHLs where those PDFs are not available on-line at the NPS).  A few of the WA NHL articles need development, by adding those references and perhaps otherwise, to justify their getting Start rating.

innocuous,"`  Since this seems to have blown up spectacularly in my face, I might as well explain my edit. /  I came across this BLP, which hadn't been edited since last year, and noticed that the paragraph about her signing that creationism petition seemed a disjointed and tangential - her signing the petition is unquestionably notable, but it seemed jarring to go straight from discussion of her research to ``In February 2006, the New York Times reported... The petition, a two-sentence statement,`` without stating why she signed the petition or anything. We have an essay about these sorts of articles and the problems with them - WP:COATRACK. I checked out her personal webpage, noticed she was quite open about her religion, googled ``Rosalind Picard christian`` and found an Atlantic Monthly article that discussed at length why she was a creationist. So I added a sentence about that, making the article flow more smoothly into the signing of the petition. I also removed the second sentence explaining the petition, as I thought it was straying too off-topic.  I discussed this with Raul and can now see the merits of leaving that last sentence in - I think the article as it now stands is acceptable. What's greatly troubling to me is that instead of discussing this and working out a compromise, certain folks refused my invitation to discuss it and instantly jumped on me and started canvassing for a revert war when a few minutes of discussion would have cheerfully resolved the situation instead. (I'm personally as agnostic and anti-creationist as it gets... the only god I'm working in the name of here is WP:BLP.)

innocuous,"`    Hi,  The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex.   The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first ``main line`` Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.  The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.  The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6`` line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.  So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.  Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.  Please feel free to use the above if you wish.  Cheers,  Michael.`",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",t2Tl5r

What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at  all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund.   The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers.  Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.  2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.  The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.  The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.  3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.  The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.  The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.  4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.  The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.  The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart.

The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out.   Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts.

I was never fired by Jared Israel because I was nevery in his employ. There was never a contract that made Jared Israel my employer. My work for Emperor's Clothes was volunteer work. Jared Israel and I had some differences and I quit. Moreover, since I was supporting Jared Israel and Emperor's Clothes financially, at the time, if anything it was I who employed Jared Israel. I have the email that I sent him, in which I quit, if Wikipedia needs to see it. But the whole thing seems rather irrelevant to me, and I doubt that every personal dispute a person has with another person needs to be on Wikipedia.  Best,  Francisco Gil-White  I have therefore removed all mention of such a firing, and I think it is best if the particular claims about Steven wise and the shoah, etc. be kept on the blog discussion pages they are on, as they don't seem too relevant to this biographical page.

If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses.

innocuous,"`  :::Well, putting this section in the article was not a consensual decision to begin with. This unsourced section was unilaterally created barely a month ago (without even an edit summary) by , a newly registered user who had created his Wikipedia account only four days earlier. I agree with Diaa's decision to remove this section, for the following reasons: :::*Having a ``Persecution of Copts`` level-2 heading in a general article about Egypt is a clear violation of WP:STRUCTURE and WP:UNDUE. We already have a Persecution of Copts article where such issues are discussed at length, and there is a hatnote linking to this article in the ``Christianity`` sub-section. The discrimination faced by Copts is also discussed in the ``Human rights`` section. Having such information discussed three times in the article gives it undue weight. :::*Such a section is a total departure from the standard sub-division of country-related articles. It is generally agreed upon at Wikipedia that country articles should only have sections covering top-importance topics, such as ``History``, ``Geography``, ``Economy``... Without belittling the difficulties faced by some Copts in Egypt, the ``persecution of copts`` is not a major topic to be discussed so prominently (by prominently, I mean by having a section devoted solely to it) in a general-interest article about Egypt. There are other countries where minorities fare far worse than in Egypt, yet we don't have specific sections in those countries' articles dealing with such issues. For instance, there's no ``Persecution of Arab-Israelis`` section in the Israel article, no ``Persecution of Tibetans`` in the People's Republic of China article, no ``Persecution of Shi'a Muslims`` in the Saudi Arabia article, no ``Persecution of Roma`` in the Hungary article, no ``Persecution of Kurds`` in the Turkey article... In fact, the persecution of minorities is not mentioned at all in any of these articles (some of which are/were FAs), let alone in a separate section. Therefore, compared to other articles, the Egypt article's dicussion of the discrimination faced by Copts is already quite sufficient and does not justify a separate section. :::*The section is a clear violation of WP:UNSOURCED, which explicitly says that ``any material lacking a reliable source directly supporting it may be removed.`` The section makes extremely grave and serious accusations, such as claims of ethnic cleansing and accusations of complicity on the part of government officials in the persecution of Copts, without citing any source whatsoever, let alone a reliable one. By removing this section, Diaa didn't do anything wrong, since WP:UNSOURCED explicitly says: ``Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living persons or organizations.`` :::*I disagree with Lanternix's assertion that ``there is nothing controversial about the section.`` In its current form, the section is clearly biased and in violation of WP:NPOV. Here are some examples: ::::*The word ``persecution`` itself is highly charged. The Arab-West Report, which the section cites, speaks not of persecution but of discrimination, which is a more appropriate concept to describe the Copts' situation. The U.S. Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report (a highly reputable and non-partisan source) enumerates several examples of discrimination faced by Copts, yet it uses the verb ``persecuted`` only once, in reference to converts from Islam to Christianity. This is due to the fact that persecution requires some degree of systematic state-sanctioned violence, and only converts are systematically targeted and surveilled by the Egyptian police. While Copts undeniably face discrimination in Egypt, whether or not they ``suffer organized persecution`` as claimed in the section is a matter of serious contention. The issue of conversion, which is cited as an example of Coptic discrimination, is actually an example of discrimination against Muslims, since it is Muslim citizens' right to change their religion that is being infringed upon. Coptic-born citizens are unaffected by the controversy surrounding conversions. ::::*Some of the issues described in the section are presented as straight facts, when the reality is in fact far more nuanced. For instance, the section plainly states that ``Coptic girls are victims of abduction and forced Islamization by Islamic fundamentalist groups``. However, this is what the International Religious Freedom Report has to say about the issue: ``As in previous years, there were occasional claims of Muslim men forcing Coptic wo",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",yIj_f1

I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process.

innocuous,"`Hi Paul  Given your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about this  The 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.  The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.  The references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.  I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are - Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee  - Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed - Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)  Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.  Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the ``trailer-park trash`` comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.  `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",4WPsUb

innocuous,"`    Just following in your footsteps, haha.  Thanks for the barnstar, by the way!  And what resources are you using for the USL all-time rosters? - I'd be happy to help.  Here's a question: we previously discussed the ``clubyears`` infobox category for MLS players, and agreed that the clubyears listed should correspond with years played.  I'm going through various Chivas USA players right now, as you saw — finishing up the all-time roster for that club — and noticing how much confusion there has been on this issue over the years at Wikipedia.  I guess I'd propose a uniform standard, based on the way that MLSnet lists player stats (and based on the nature of the league): any season for which a player is rostered with a team is counted into the clubyears section.  For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.  I think this is the best way to record years — and, happily, it conforms with the way the league's official site records stats.  I have been thinking that we US-soccer editors might want to have some sort of official ``summit`` (or meeting, or whatever) on the talk page of the US/Canada WP:FOOTY taskforce...we could nail down guidelines on a number of tricky issues which are particular to American soccer, or at least somewhat unusual...like the exact way to list colleges, the way to list years, when to use accents in names, how to properly disambiguate American players, all kinds of things.  Then we could write these guidelines out and put them up so that newer editors understand how to do things. ''' 《》''' `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",OXjbG8

innocuous,"`    The section on fictional technology in Atlas Shrugged is taking up space that could be used to address much more important issues about the novel, such as how Rand structured the concrete events of the novel to demonstrate the abstract principles she presented in Galt's speech. The fictional technology section borders on triviality because these technologies are not intended to be anything other than place holders for actual technologies that are always pioneered by the individual reasoning mind and perverted by altruist-collectivist villains. Rand's fictional technologies are not in the tradition of science fiction projections of the social consequences of space travel or robotics, they are closer to the projected technologies in Fritz Lang's Metropolis  the technology is there to show the exploitation of the workers in Metropolis and of the 'men of the mind' in Atlas. Consider the ``Ferris Persuader`` at the climax. The real point of the scene is that they are torturing Galt to force him to take over the failing economy (true!) when the machine fails and Galt has to tell them how to repair the device with which they are torturing him, making the point that as parasites they need his mind for everything.  It trivializes the work to devote so much time to the details of the imaginary technology and so little to its meaning.   The same thing is true of the comparison of the fictional railroad to the real ones. I propose we get rid of all these comparatively trivial items and instead draw on the many scholarly sources on the structure and meaning of Atlas Shrugged including those from ARI, The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, etc., and I call on members of Wiki Project Objectivism to help.

Completely reverting all my useful comments based on firsthand knowledge of the diet and its effects on my health did not seem helpful at all, since you decided you knew better.  Do you have any knowledge on this subject?  If so, please inform me.  Do you have cancer?  Also, please explain, for example, why ``proponents`` of Budwig's diet mention 6 or 7 Nobel Prize nominations when 7 nominations are clearly stated on the book's cover but you reverted this completely to make it sound suspect to another person's account that apparently has none of the doctor's books and is operating from internet anecdotes as valid citations.  The truth is that ``critics`` (apparently existing mainly on Wikipedia) have issue with the book's statement, yet this fact could not be allowed to stand, even though the un-updated online source was left intact.  This ``Nobel Prize`` section of the article is actually useless and did not exist in earlier versions; it should be deleted outright.  Finally, please tell me what references you expect to corroborate the minimal extra information I included (they information is contained in the her two primary books: ``Oil-Protein Diet`` and ``Flax Oil as ...``).  If you knew anything about the diet, you would find what was reported in this so-called encyclopedic entry embarrassing.  My point was to improve it so that other cancer sufferers would not be mislead into thinking this diet is some half-baked diversion and would seek out the books and learn more.  Please tell me what your objective is and why.

innocuous,"`  Dear Jim:  You have asked a very good question about published interviews.  I believe that Wikipedia editors and reviewers take each case individually in this situation.  For example, if a person is interviewed by a professional journalist, and the interviewer writes introductory information, we assume that he or she would have checked the facts before writing it.  Also, if the person being interviewed gives non-controversial information, such as ``My restaurant is in London, England``, the interview can be used to back up that fact. Surely the interviewer would have spoken up it this obvious fact were not true. However, if in the same interview the person says ``Everyone loves my spaghetti sauce.``, that wouldn't be accepted. An independent food critic would need to write about that. In general, interviews are weak sources because most of the text is the subject's own words, and people don't always see themselves as others see them.  The weaker the source, the more are needed to corroborate facts.  However, if there are a number of different interviews published in reliable sources, they should be included as references, because the fact of being interviewed  means that the subject had come to the attention of the press.  Interviews which are not published shouldn't be used at all.  In reference to your article, I see that some of the events happened long ago.  There are surely news reports about some of these happenings, but they may be hard to find because there was no Internet then.  I faced the same problem when creating this page: Toronto Light Opera Association.  I couldn't use my mother's first hand information as a source; I had to travel to a city library and look up old microfilm newspaper records.    By the way, I have removed the Op Cit references in the article and changed them to refer to the actual source.  Op cit doesn't work well in Wikipedia, because people will come along and add a citation to a new source in between, and then the op cit points to the wrong reference.

She was saying her character was 16...she was not saying that she needed to be 16 for audition purposes.  Now, when she went in to do the audition they asked her how old she was and she told them she was ``going to be`` 18....not telling them when that was....which is what the lie or fib was. The producers of the show wanted the actors to be 18 or turning 18 soon, so they wouldn't have to deal with home schooling, etc...

As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion. I mean, every article on Wiki about a specific group would be expected to have info on the ideas, goals and beliefs of that group. That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way. :Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had.

First a certificate of Life birth is not a birth certificate which the lefties are trying to say as proof he was born in hawaii.  If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don't know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.    also being censored are obamas ties to socialist and terrorist organizations.  He is affiliated with Ayers, who an uncover FBI agent recorded a dialog where Ayers group planned to kill 25 million americans who could not convert to socialism.  During the 1990 the socialist New Party listed him as a member.  His national security picks have ties to the chinese Government, and to the bin ladin Family.  And he seems cozy to opening up to socialist Cuba as well.  He has a harvard Law degree, his economic stimulus full of financing socialist and Keynesian polcies that will bleed the private sector dry while bankrupting our nation fiscally spending more and more money we don't even have and a debt we cannot repay, some newspapers have argued that obama's ``fix`` will cause a second depression.  So one might have to argue is a harvard law degree completely worthless, or if Obama plans to lead us down the road to destruction to nationalism and communism.

The largest number of English-language articles in this topic area has been written by Anne, . She's a physician and mom from Chicago, who joined Wikipedia back in February. Within weeks she was being praised for the exceptional quality of her contributions and was being awarded barnstars, including an ``Exceptional Newcomer Barnstar``. She has made numerous contributions to DYK prior to Gibraltarpedia. Her articles are of the highest quality and there has never been any suggestion that she has any profit-making motives. She has no involvement in the organisational side of Gibraltarpedia. She's just an enthusiastic contributor, motivated by the fun of competition.  The campaign being waged by Andreas and his Wikipediocracy cronies, some of whom claimed falsely that she was someone's sockpuppet, has disproportionately affected her DYKs. She's spoken of her upset at being blacklisted  and of feeling ``sent to the back of the bus``. Why should an enthusiastic newcomer be attacked in this way? Why should she be accused with no basis whatsoever of ``profit-seeking`` and of being a sockpuppet? Why should her DYKs, the quality of which everyone has praised, be blacklisted? Wikipedia is having problems retaining editors as it is. How does the project benefit in any way from rejecting the work of able and talented contributors who are contributing for no reason other than personal interest and fun?

Back in the days when anybody and his dog could merrily create new articles, there were periods when I'd take a quick look an average of a dozen or more new articles every day. (Of course thousands were being made, and some people were routinely checking fifty or more.) The great majority were horrible: they weren't decent stubs but instead for the most part unsupported assertions, often transparently about the author, his best buddy, his big brother, etc., and otherwise typically about the most trivial or ephemeral non-subject. Of course a number of these articles had the germs of the kind of thing that Nicholson Baker eloquently expounded on in his New Yorker piece, but these were rare. Why did so many people feel so compelled to aggrandize themselves, and why were so many lives devoted to this or that computer game? My mood got bleaker and bleaker, and it's likely that this aggravated my view of people making iffy or worse changes to legitimate articles. So I stopped this ``new article patrolling`` and felt a lot better.  :Actually my empirically unsupported hunch is that administratifying in quantity is bad for the ``soul``, and thus that people should not be encouraged to do too much of it.

I don't know how to change these things, but if you'd agree, I wanted to ask for your help. Here's what I posted:    :I'd like to suggest that the sections about 'customary law' be removed. The reason is that I just don't think it's an actual legal system in its own right. Custom is certainly a source of law, and an important one, but it doesn't constitute a legal system. The only two examples given are Andorra and Mongolia. This is a link to law in Mongolia, which I googled in about 2 seconds, showing a distinct lack of 'custom' - it's a civil code based jurisdiction. As for Andorra, it's a European country, and I bet it's got a civil law system much like the places around it. If you wanted you could call the common law customary law under the definition given on the customary law page, and you could call England a mixed system with custom and common law: think of all the Parliamentary procedures, or the custom that the monarch doesn't sack the elected government (since 1707 I think).

How can there be any violence if there's practically no minority? The 20 people who comprise the Skopjan political party Rainbow (got something like 100 votes in the elections) are the only official record I'm aware of and that's because they have a website. Once they tried to put up some propaganda posters written in Cyrillic but had their office smashed on the next day, and ``thus was this matter settled``. Macedonian Slavs will claim that some 95% of Greek Macedonia is ethnic Skopjan, opressed by the Greek government and forbidden to speak its language etc, etc, etc. The story about the infamous ``partition`` of Macedonia refers to the defeat of Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars. Of course there's no record of a ``Macedonian`` army ever taking part, although in their history books it can reach up to 100,000 soldiers (that would be 1/6 of the army of Napoleon and slightly smaller that the army that conquered Constantinople under Mehmed II).

The facts of the marriage have no import because the 1980 judgement which Mr. Marcovitz violated are after the marriage.

It is not that they deny there race its just that they can't just clasify or represent themselves as one race. Though they are other dominican groups which have mostly African ancestry.

Sutcliff represented the emergence of Anglo-Saxon England from Romano Britain as a process of ethnic cleansing. At one stage, archaeology and place name analysis suggested that Sutcliff was wrong, and the process was more one of cultural assimilation. For example, it can be demonstrated that Celtic people were living in the London area until well into the Saxon era (note the origins of the place name ``Wallington``). The logic here being that ethnic cleansing is a modern concept, alien to the 45 - 600 AD period. But, DNA evidence has now established that ethnic cleansing did happen in Dark Ages Britain.

I would suggest that Duckflesh do a little more research into the field of addictive behaviours and note that this not only occurs with alcohol, but with many other substances which have mood altering effects, including food. Several European studies ( Grunner, et al) have studied the effects of dipsomania on predominantly non-drinkers who experience this unexplainable functioning within the brain.

I consider Thomas Jentz to be absolutely meticulous in his writing, documenting where he obtained every scrap of information, and setting down no more than what his sources state.  As such the range-penetration data which Jentz set down in his two books -  ``Germany's Panther Tank`` and ``Germany's Tiger Tanks: Tiger I & Tiger II: Combat Tactics`` are about as definitive as it gets for the gun vs. armor debates.   And in those books, you'll find that neither the 122mm Soviet gun nor the 17-pounder could penetrate the front glacis plate of the Panther at any range.  You'll find that the T-34's 85mm gun was slightly WORSE than the much maligned 76mm gun of the even more maligned M4 Sherman.  So much for the ``best tank in the world`` label - how could that be if the German Army tests say the T-34's 85mm gun was not as good as the M4 Sherman's 76mm gun?  This same data show that the much maligned armor of the M4 Sherman was roughly equivalent to the T-34-85 as far as  resisting puncture by the Panther's 75m Kwk 42  - neither tank's armor was any good, but they were about equal. ``Best tank in the world``?  Or just a myth, perhaps only momentarily true for the 1941 time period.   Jentz's data show that the firepower and armor of the 76mm M4 Sherman and the T-34-85 were very, very close to each other.    ::::Jentz's data are all from tests done by the German and British Armies on captured tanks, and these are about as reliable as it gets.  I have no idea where the Soviet data comes from.  Perhaps they were testing precision manufactured versions of their guns instead of what actually came out from their factories.  Yes, theoretically a 122mm gun should do a lot better than a 75mm gun, and an 85mm gun should do better than a 76mm gun, but not if the barrel and gunpowder are so shoddily manufactured that the factory gun could not generate the required high pressures and velocities.

innocuous,"`    Erik, I'm compiling full text of reviews and analyses  for this film. You're welcome to it if you're looking for source material (I'm still organizing and adding to it, so bear with me). What did you think of I Am Legend? |    Just saw Legend, and last act wasn't as bad as some have maintained. It was a given they'd never go down the route of the novel, with either the plot or the ending, not with a $150 million budget, and arming oneself with that knowledge should have enabled one to try to enjoy the film for what it was. And what it was, was perfectly adequate. Ultimately more a War of the Worlds than a Children of Men, it nevertheless features some reasonable jump-scares enlivened by some a couple of nice shots (the quick cuts to the SnorriCam as Smith legs it from the CGI beasties) and a well-constructed (if derivative) NY playground. In summary then: not shit. 6/10.    ()     Has it been captioned yet, so you can see it?      Yeah, the comment could have been lifted straight from the talk page for Golden Compass, and the change appeared on my watchlist right above one for that, so it's not surprising the conflation occurred, as any religious allusions in I Am Legend are likely pretty vague, and I'd just been tidying some of the usual stuff from the Compass article. Best regards,    ()   :With Ghost Busters vs. Ghostbusters, I figure we go for what people generally know it as, though truth be told, either would be fine with me. Both should definitely be mentioned in the lead, however. And yeah, it's been a good holiday. How about you? I'm still largely off-Wiki until next week, but I'm managing to find more time these last couple of days to pop in to check on things. Best regards,    ()   ::I had a detailed response at my parents, but their internet crapped out (computers are crashing left and right near me..lol). Anyway, it boiled down to me liking the last half and asking you want you didn't like specifically about Anna and the boy. What are your thoughts on the new Dark Knight trailer? There was a scene where Ledger is in the cell and he's basically smacking his lips together...it reminded me a lot of Nicholson's Joker.      :::Trust me, I won't read the book...and if I do it will be far down the road and I won't remember being spoiled. The trailer wasn't captioned?! That sucks. He has a line, where Batman is on the batcycle and is driving at him. He says something to the idea of ``come and get me``, and that reminded me of Nicholson when Batman was bearing down on him with the batwing. Makes me wonder how may references and allusions to Burton's ``Joker`` they'll make. I'm working on the new computer. I'm supposed to go to the Geek Squad to appease my mother's mind, then, hopefully, her and I will sit down over the phone and build the same computer online. This way, when we get to the end we can see who will get the better interest rate. I'm still going to pay for it, but if she gets a better rate then she's going to order it and have the bills come to me. So, hopefully in a week (2 at the most) I'll be back online in a fuller capacity. I still need to sit down and watch that Fight Club commentary for you as well. Did you want the ``writers commentary`` first?      ::::See, for me I liked the fact that they were less ``vampiric``, because that has become so cliched nowadaysespecially with 30 Days of Night most recently in theaters. I thought it was interesting that the person that invented the ``cure for cancer`` was a woman, but her ``cure`` turned out to be the cause of the extinction of humankind. I wonder if there are any feminists outraged out there. lol. Especially since it was a ``man`` that was left to ``fix`` the mess. The dog reminded me of my own dog, except a bit more obedient and protective. I think this is a case where I like the changes from what your described, because it adds a scarier touch to the idea of total isolation. I mean, you can see the evolution of the ``dark seekers`` in the movie, which was obviously taken from how Anna was an evolved ``vampire`` in the book (as you described). I think with the changes it manages to give people that read the book a chance to see something different, but in the same vein as the book itself. I'm only doing it for my mother's sake. They say they have a ``two day turn around`` with diagnostics. I figure having them say ``this is the problem``, probably won't change my mind on getting a new computer. Basically, my current (dead) computer couldn't handle Windows Vista. I know there are kinks in Vista, but there were kinks in XP, and everything newespecially gamesare becoming more and more ``Vista only``. I figure, I'll buy a better computer (with better RAM, graphics card, and more Hard drive space) with Vista...and if I have too many problems I'll just take their free downgrade to Windows XP. I figure, it's better to get Vista now, and if need be downgrade for free, than to get XP initially and have to buy Vista afterwards.

While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced.     These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  )    Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.    :I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet.

In Northernmost France are comments about Parisians as ``snubs``, ``self centered``, ``materialist`` and ``get the good jobs``. My Dad's family are proud to be Frenchmen/women/people, and don't hold grudges on other races or people. My grandpa and great-grandpa fought against Nazis for their cruelty done to France and oppose their ideology as socialists. There are depictions, negative or positive, or not always true, on France's political neighbors. They made jokes why the English have hands on their laps under the table (a breach of French etiquette for reasons I won't discuss), and Americans are always smiling (I noticed the French have emotions, but not much smiling) and demand treatment/service on the spot. Some locals said things on Belgians, Germans, Swiss and Italians. The worst comments goes to the British as ``hooligans can't handle their gin``. Not as bad goes to Spaniards as ``flamboyant`` or Austrians as ``robotic``. Nationality slurs aren't kind and are inflammatory, and France has strict laws regarding hate speech not just to protect Jews, Christians, women, homosexuals, immigrants and visitors from biased comments.

Of 28 weaker studies, 9 favoured Canada, 3 favoured the United States, and 16 were equivalent or mixed.

It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources, and the notability of the article's subject is usually established in the first few sentences. Apart from trivial basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article.`` This article's lead does not follow those guidelines. The lead should refer to the accepted theory that Mark was used as a source of both Matthew and Luke and briefly discuss the very ``prominent controversy`` surrounding the end of the Gospel. It should not refer to  ``an understanding of 1st century Greco-Roman culture regarding oral tradition`` or `` pre-Pauline beliefs`` because those concepts are not covered in the remainder of the article.

The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.  The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple ``revolutionary brigades,`` militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.  The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.  Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.  On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.  The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.  ``The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,`` said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.  A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.  The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.  '''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.``   Now dou you see the bold part?    `",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",fDA9hC

And, it seems to me the 3rd component is the most important.  After all, if AGW didn't have negative consequences, there wouldn't be much cause for concern, and isn't that what WGII is all about?   :::However, since the first paragraph currently makes no mention of impacts, then, yes, footnote B should not contain concurring bodies who's science doesn't deal specifically with temperature increase and causation.

Earth sciences, of course, involve everything from Atmospheric chemistry and Meteorology to Oceanography and Geophysics.  And, yes, Petrology too.  Chemistry and physics is, of course, so fundamental it has to be included. To address Awickert's concern's, perhaps the end of the first paragraph could look something like this:   ::::These basic conclusions have been endorsed by numerous scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries. A small number of individual scientists and a few scientific societies dispute the consensus view.    :::Linking twice to the ``Opinion`` article might be a bit redundant, but the second link to the ``Noncommittal`` section takes readers right where they want to go.

It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was ``27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in.`` (p. 321).

Ada Lovelace Day is a relatively new event, but one which has already garnered international participation and press.

I can provide a bunch of sources from major media outlets that reported about the scope and success of the first iteration of the event if necessary (as well as plans for the second go for this year) that hopefully should provide some proof of the event's broad reach around the world.

innocuous,"In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies.   Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916.   This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).]   The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",wiki_toxic,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",RvsenZ

Subjects that can be considered promotional, like yours, risk being completely deleted if they do not have enough coverage. In the article, you state that the product has been featured in over 200 articles. That means there are over, in theory 200 citations that could be used to write the article.

He added that ``looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours.``  Again - I'm not sure that this section needs to exist. Also from the outset it is misleading. CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming  - they didn't suddenly decide to start after this case.   CEOP has existed since April 2006 and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since - starting it's main recognised operations in 2009, by which time the police were acting.

The point is there IS no gay community.  A few lesbians does not a community make.  But I'm not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home.  It has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years.  The point is, the term itself, Dyke Slope.  I don't like it.  I've never heard it.  I don't think its appropriate for Wikipedia.  And don't tell me what to do.  I can type whatever I feel like on this page.  I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like ``Dike Slope``.  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.

If some admin is taking continuous interest in one particular area of articles, they must be having some kind of involvement/interest in the content in that area. That is not respectable adminning and will clearly lead to problems, as indeed it is here. It creates a situation where eds from only one particular orientation will have paramount power on article content and the eds on the other side will get butchered.
