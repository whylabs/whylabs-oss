medical,"About three weeks ago, my calf was swollen, red, and itchy after a 7 hour car ride from SF to LA. I also noticed there was a lump/bump beneath my skin at the location of the swelling and a noticeable warmth at the site. I waited a couple of days to see if the swelling would go away but when my condition stayed the same, I went to an urgent care center. They ruled out DVT based on my symptoms and they suggested it was an infection of some sort and prescribed me an antibiotic, which I never took. I wasn t 100% confident with their prognosis since there was no open wound/bite mark of any sort and the itch felt like it was beneath the skin and not topical as scratching did not alleviate the discomfort. Over the next few days, my lower leg became increasingly swollen and the bump moved to my inner calf/leg. When I noticed my ankle started to swell, I went to the ER to get an ultrasound and it too came back negative for DVT. Long story short, over the next two weeks, the lump/bump, which is now more of a mass the size of a child s fist, has migrated. What started as swelling from my lower calf has migrated to my inner calf, up to my knee, up to inner thigh, front of the thigh, and now, at the three week mark, it is on my hip. The mass is still warm to the touch, itchy, and has also left slight bruising and small residual bumps along it s path.

Recently (last few weeks) my doctor changed to Methylin (20 mg/day) because insurance was giving us problems with Concerta. The Methylin really did not do anything for me. I saw my primary care physician in December, and discussed this. I told her side effects from the Concerta (cannot sleep, no appetite, mood swings, etc. common from what I have read about Concerta). She then wanted me to try 20 mg of Methylin in the morning, 10 mg in the evening because of the long days I need to be focused in law school. Anyway, getting to the point of my question (I wanted to provide background the best I could). Since I have switched, I have actually found the new medicine to work. It is not as, umm not sure how else to put this but, punch you in the face, like Concerta can be. It is more even throughout the dosage. BUT, I have been having terrible, terrible headaches since I have been taking it. On the bottle, it says that is a side effect. I am wondering if this is a normal side effect.

I have never been able to go and talk with people, because I m way too shy. If somebody walk over to me and start talking, I automaticly back off. 2. Depression . Is there a way to get rid of this without asking your parents, talking with psychologists, taking anti-depressants? 3. Thoughts. Do you have any tips on how to refresh your thoughts from bad to good? I can t think positive, no matter how hard I try. In my head, there isn t even a future. 4. Eating disorders. I m starting to get worried that I might have one, but I m not sure, and I don t want to ask my mom. 2 years ago, I could eat several plates of food, but I lost the appetite completely. I hate food, and I can t eat more than 1 apple each day without feeling fat or guilty. 5. Maturity. Is there some steps to make the maturity process go faster? I mean in the head.

She said it was almost as if she had been in a serious car accident (which she has not been). She went on to say that she had very little abdominal muscles and her upper thighs were very tight because that was what was holding her back up. We did physio for about a year and she taught my daughter how to strengthen her stomach muscles and shoulder muscles (for her neck).

About 4 months ago I had a few episodes were my eyes got very itchy and dry on and off and a few times I had some eye symptoms...minor swelling of the right upper eyelid , twice had a bubble which looked like a mosquito bite form under the eye (one time each eye) and another time I woke up with small to medium size bag under my left eye. Each time I felt fine other than the small amount of swelling and each time it was only in one eye, never both. In fact, most times I didn t realize until I went and looked in the mirror and then got scared after seeing the small amount of swelling. I also saw an eye doctor last fall after the first issue with it and the covering of my left eyeball was slightly fluid filled, which he said was due to an irritant and nothing to worry about. We had also found some black mold in our basement at that time that a plumber opened up the ceiling (so conceivably, some of these mold spores may have come out into the air...I had had no issues before this). I am now about 120 pounds (was 140 before I lost the weight) and female and 45 years old. I am a very nervous person and had been under severe stress for several months. It was during this time I started getting the eye symptoms. So stress, the mold issue and most likely the start of peri- menopause may all be contributing. Two of times I got the eye symptoms I had eaten peanut butter....but many hours beforehand. One time it was probably between 4-6 hours earlier and the second time, it was about 10-12 hours earlier. I had also had peanut butter in between with no symptoms. Each time I felt fine other than later on getting some eye symptoms. I had also, due to the stress, had lost 20 pounds during those months and once became dehydrated. Both times I had gotten the little bump under my eye (like a mosquito bite), I had been under acute stress both those days. Those are the only 2 times that ever happened. My general physician feels it s all stress-related and also seasonal allergies (I seem to have a little bit of hayfever). He said my symptoms are not consistent with food allergy or peanut butter allergy. Since not having any peanut products, I ve had no eye swelling, bags or bumps, but my stress level is also a LOT lower now. Should I get a blood allergy test for peanuts or is it most likely stress-related or hormone-related? Is it just a coincidence? Whenever I ve eaten peanut butter I always feel absolutely fine afterwards...even relaxed. No other symptoms...no rash, no breathing issues, nothing else. Being the nervous person I am though, I have worried that if the eye symptoms were related to the peanut butter, then my reaction could be worse next time. That s my main fear in trying the peanut butter again (as I said, I had been suffering anxiety and panic for several months, so my thought process became a little skewed). Would love to know if it s safe to just try the peanut butter again or if I should have the blood test. Thank you.",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZXB-fw

medical,"My son is 11 yrs old. He used to be in the swimming team but once when he was in training, he felt chest pains and out of breath as well as a bit dizzy. The trainers let him lie down and he felt better and he was taken to the hospital for ECG and echodiagram. The results were normal. We also had him take the treadmill test. All tests are normal. After a few weeks, he went back to training and the same thing happened, we thought it must be because his traning is in the morning and maybe his blood sugar level is low. Nevertheless, we stopped his swimming trainings. Several weeks ago, we went on a vacation and after swimming in the beach for a while, he suddenly felt that his heart rate s very fast so i just asked him to lie down and rest. It went away but that night during dinner, he complained of fast heart beat again and had to lie down in the restaurant. I could feel his heartbeat when i put my hand on his chest. We were thinking, maybe he just lacked sleep cause he had been sleeping very late at nite and waking up real early the past few days. Just tonight, after dinner, he complained again of fast heart rate.

It has been constant since that time. We were first told TMJ. All of the blood tests that have been run by a family doctor and neurologist have been normal except her Vitamin D was low (20). She s periodically nauseas throughout the day, doesn t eat much and takes small cat naps, which she hasn t done for years, even when she s been up late with friends.

medical,"Hi there. I m not exactly sure if a real doctor will answer this- let alone the fact it will be answered. I have a world of questions to ask... but I guess I ll ask this one, well maybe two. Is it possible for an individual s intelligence to fluctuate? When I was younger it appeared that I was simply average, IQ wise... in my family it was just an unspoken truth that I was the least intelligent. But as I got older, around 17 I began paying attention more in school and trying more and found that I achieved top marks. Not just slightly above average but far exceeding that of my peers. In most classes I had the highest mark. It led me to wonder whether I became smarter with age? I don t know, is this possible? And if so, is it possible for me to become less smart? They say the brain is like a muscle and it needs to be used but I ve also heard that no one can actually alter their natural intelligence?
