A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat.

Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now.

Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners.

medical,"My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid.

Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about , I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36, only bloods still showed infection, but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was.

They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary.

medical,"we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really dont want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .

The chest tightness moves around or even goes away sometimes but for the most part it in the base of my lungs or sometimes a bit lower than my rib cage.

Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse.

medical,"Hello, my name is Davie. I have severe back and neck problems, have for close to a decade. My entire spine and neck is very sore, nerve problems and no doubt my spine would be out in lots of places. A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isnt constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. Its in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words cant describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where im getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. Im just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but theres no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful. If i honestly thought it was my heart and i had no trouble at all with back or neck pain, id be at the hospital right now. I just honestly dont feel its my heart and i know how ridiculous my back feels right now with the pain im in. Im only 35, so i dont think its a heart attack or stroke or anything and i have no tingling or numbness or anything in my arms/hands.

I m being treated with Ventab DXT 25, Macorate CR200, Wacalert 50 & Zapiz 1.00 whenever I feel more anxiety or seem not able to control my thoughts. Actually, this started in 1998 from Exam Phobia & was treated for same. Since then I ve been in & out on medication from time to time till 2007 from where there s consistency in medication & follow ups. Sutre, the treatment has helped me to stabilize over the period. I ve got married, have a small daughter, completed post graduation, MBA & also did certification in SAP FI. The doctor has been of great help to me. He was of opinion that I ve lesser coping capacity. And, that s not entirely wrong. His major concern has been my changing the job & settling in it. He s slowly started reducing power of drugs with powers mentioned above. But, it seems I ve developed dependency on these medicines. And, I want to stand on my own with my thought controlling me rather than medicines. In this blog, I read in answer to one patient, reference to Meditation, Self Motivation. Meditation or Yoga is okay for me since I ve learned it scientifically. I want to know about self motivation. Is there any specific resource available? How can I access it? Will I ever be able to overcome these feelings? or they ve become a part of my personality? I wish to live a life free of medication & complete self reliance.

medical,I had a mitral valve repair in July of 2009. Last Wednesday at my annual physical my PCP said I had an abnormal EKG ( he said it showed a possible problem with the right side of my heart ). I have felt pressure in my chest especially when I exercise & just a little bit when at rest for about the last 6 weeks which I ignored until my EKG result. I have an appointment with my cardiologist in 9 days. What do you think are the possibilities? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.

I have fed him toast today but isn t interested really in eating but its hard trying to get fluids into him so tried him with soup tonight, he ate it then immediately afterwards threw up he has done this the past 3 nights. Is there anything I can give him which will help him get over this??? Or what foods are good for him to try keep his strength up??

Next day i visited my doctor and he had got all the clinical as well as pathological examination done, i also visited a urologist and after discussing my reports jointly they came to the conslusion that there in notinh serious and i was adviced to increase my sexual activities for some days and have to observe regularly about the presence of blood. Surprisingly the quantity of blood got reduced with each intercourse and after about one week it was clear. I was advised to remain sexually active or you can say not to put a big gap i.e. 10-15 days, if it happens i have been advised masturbation.

When her normal pediatrician did rounds the following morning she felt that the stomach pain was due to her lactose intollerace and to modify her diet, however I am concerned because she still has the fever and some abdominal pain and her diet has drastically declined over the last few days, I am not sure how to procede from here to handle this, or am I just being overcausious.",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",W9kkX_

I was still able to movw my arm afterwards but as the shouldwr cooled down it made it impossible for me to move it without assistance. Aboit a year ago I was playing football and threw a ball against the wind. When I did that I felt a small pop in the middle/center parr of my shoulder. I did see a therapist for it and had it fixed. This pain is similar but more intense. My shoulder is not poped out but my rotation is very limited. I have to assist my right arm even when I am laying down. Whether its putting my arm on my stomach or above me it still needs assistance. Whenever I feel I want to move my arm anywhere, I feel I have to battle a tweak inside my shoulder. Would this be a rotater cuff injury or just some swelling that isnt allowing my arm to move yet? I fell like something needs to pop back into place but only slightly.

Last week she had problem of high fever and was unconscious. Later she was diagnose with meningitis which was cured after week of vaccination. Further doctor suggested for MRI scan (there was leak) in which we can see open hole. After which we consulted neuro surgeon they confirmed hole is still there and we need to open brain to fix it. So looking this to be big and complex surgery I consulted ENT team and they again did endoscopic (as I mentioned this CSF leak is intermittent, so during endoscopic check up there was no leak) and mentioned there is no leak.

medical,"HI At my last appointment with my heart specialist the doctor increased my dose of Carvidilol (Coureg) to 12.5mg twice per day in the hope that this would decrease the chances of an AFIB event, in fact he said I can eat anything now. Unfortunately over Christmas I had two or three AFIB events each of which subsided after a few hours and where my pulse fortunately never reached over 124 ppm ( at least when I checked it ). The reason for the events was probably due to over indulgence in foods that may have had higher levels of sodium chloride at the same time as drinking a lot of wine and on one occasion brandy. On a normal day my pulse is 49 to 52 in the morning and seldom gets above 65 even after some fairly heavy physical activity. It does go up to mid to high 60 s if I have two or three glasses of wine. Normally of course I am on a very low salt diet as my wife and I make almost everything from scratch ourselves without adding sodium chloride. The reason I am writing is that early March we are traveling to Australia for a month followed by a month cruising back to the US. I don t know whether I will be able to get low or no salt food on board the ship. I m wondering whether an even higher dose of coureg might be advisable during the trip to counter the unknown levels of salt I will encounter on the voyage.

They are particularly annoying on my scalp, but have appeared on my arms, my hands, my wrists and my chest. Creams prescribed by the doctor have done little to alleviate the symptoms. They first arrived soon after my return form Myanmar. I remember feeling physically low at the time but did not have a high fever. During investigations, the GP found a Keratoacanthoma, this was removed. Should I be concerned about scrub typhus? Could the Keratoacanthoma have been the eschar?

Now after this treatment loke a week ago I was having blood in the stool but it was with mucous and what it looked like a lining. I had no abdominal pain, no fever or chills. 3 days ago it came back the blood in the stool but today I felt gassy and I went to the bathroom and I had pooped but this time it was bloody..when I cleaned myself the paper was with blood like when you wipe during a menstrual period.

medical,"hI, I have no question for you. Just an attitude as to how pain management is being, or should I say not being done. Because of a handful of people who CHOOSE TO Abuse drugs, who really gets punished? Spinal Stenosis and 2 back surgeries, the last the titanium rods, plates, and screws were inserted from L2 thru L5. Stopped the pain for about 2 years, or at least at a tolerable level. Then Lortabs helped. Sent to pain clinic for epidurals. Epidurals on me were extremely painful. Scale of 1-10 they were a 20. (Not Kidding) Quality of life was going fast. couldn t do or go because the pain had grown to the point that I couldn t eat or sleep. Pain was 24 hours a day. Told by the pain Dr. to stay on the Lortab and come to the pain clinic every 4 or 5 weeks for epidurals. Epidurals were not only painful but I got very little relief if any from them. Finally PCP started me on oxycontin and Fentynal patch. I was much better for awile. I was taught that in so called pain management you would gradually increase dose until you knew the patient was experiencing some quality of life. I reached rock bottom after telling PCP my quality of life was slipping away. Finally I asked for an increase in pain med as pain was now 24 hours a day. I could not function. I was told no, and referred to pain clinic for more epidurals and Narcotics. The day I went in to office for routine followup and new perscriptions I was ask for a urine specimen. After all I d been thru over the last 8 to 10 years, all the operations and all the pain. The loss of any quality of life. I am in my 70 s and lost all those Golden years, 10 of them. Asking for a urine specimen. I felt made ME the criminal. I decided right then I asked to be titrated off the narcotic meds. I will die with all the pain before I will let anyone treat me like a criminal. So you go on breaking your solom oath by hurting patients . Doctors swore to do no harm. A large % of those being hurt and are suffuring are the geriatric population. I feel Obama has been behind a lot of this but you know I believe a lot of the fault falls on every Doctor, Nurse, and everyone working in health care. STAND UP FOR YOUR PATIENTS. yOU ALL ARE JUST LIKE THE POLITICIANS. tO SAVE THEIR OWN HIDES THEY JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES TO WHAT IS HAPPINING TO MEDICINE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SAY NOTHING. tHE PUBLIC CAN T EVEN GET TOGETHER AND STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. The old time Doctor s predicted It would be like this. They said if the HMO went through it would be the death of our wonderful medical care in this country. Many have passed but they were right on. They realized that there would not be anymore decent medical care. The patient is really obsolete. No more real check ups. no more time to explain your problem. No more real examinations Oh, there is on paper or in the computer so health care workers, even Doctors just make sure they cover their butts, to the point of out right lying!!! Make it look like things were done just to collect the fees. The lawyers are partially to blame also with their ambulance chasing and advertising for frivolous malpractice suits. Rep. and Dems. just sit on their hands. Political correctness has run amuck. I thoroughly loved working in the medical world at one time. Now I want nothing to do with it Extreme pain is killing me literally but I will die with it. Think back of all the pain meds that really did relieve pain. Where are they now. Listed as a narcotic, now even lortab now and it is only hurting those who really need it. The really sick. But their pain med prescription has to be picked up at dr s. office no matter if they can hardly get out of bed. No husband or designated relative or person can pick it up. Can t even be called into the pharmacy anymore. What do they think they are doing. I am done with a medical world that has turned into nothing but a money making machine. Worst of all the money flows to the very few at the top while staffs are cut to the bone. Doctors are told what they can and can t do, how many patients they have to see in a day. no wonder there is no examining going on, No time to get to know their patients. On top of that not enougChatDoctorpensation for what they are trying to do. Trying to do the impossible. The patient is only needed for a name and insurance number. The old days were Heaven when working in the medical field if your heart was in it. Today s medical world is Hell in my eyes after all my personal experiences. A lot of us feel like we are on our own and no matter what doctor you go to we are not being treated, just pushed thru the system as fast as possible. Many, many mistakes are being made. No one, including doctors and nurses seem to know what they are doing. It is not their fault. They are not being properly taught and trained, just shoved thru school and paying exorbitant rates to do it. Something I use to love so very much has become something very ugly and I hate it. I have been on both ends.

medical,"Dear Doctor, Alcohol, Atrial Fibrillation & Life after... I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) is 4cm wide whereas it should be at maximum 3.8cm (from memory, and I can t remember what was what exactly). Also, there was another measure from the ECG of 450ms or such between beat... Where it should stay under 450 or 430... Again, I do not recall the exact lingo... My question is simple. Are there any known adverse effect to taking a medication such as Rytmonorm, does it affect the initial problem (atrial fibrillation)? Is there any way to remedy the problem without resorting to ablation (which has a low success rate) or cut through the electrical system (old style)... I really would like to get off the medication.

I usually masturbate after I have been to the toilet. The masturbation was quite short lasting, lying on my back, quite gentle masturbation, not rough, but at the ejaculation point, it didn t feel very good, a little painful during, which I haven t experienced before. I think it must have been related to the bladder not being emptied first. A few minutes later, I possibly made a second mistake, by urinating. It did seem like the urethrea was not ready for urine yet, took a while to succeed. Is it advised to wait a while before one urinates? Then during the day and night I have felt rather uncomfortable, mostly during the night, some pain/discomfort, which feels like it is located at the point where I usually feel if I need to urinate or not. Is this bladder pain? It helps a bit to urinate though. Could I have had some urine in the urethrea accidentally mixed together with the sperm during ejaculation? And is this harmful? I also wanna mention that the night before this I ate two oranges and quite much chocolate, which could make the urine more acid and harmful? I have not had sex for a long time, and never unprotected, so STD is out of the question. Now I am taking some ibuprofen and also some cranberry capsules. Not sure if I should see a doctor yet, since this is so fresh. I have a tendency to see doctor too often and worry about health matters. Could you please shed light to what might have happened? Does it sound like a temporary problem? Or will I next time also feel discomfort during ejaculation? I haven t tried masturbating again, since I think I should rest the system for some days.",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EzuVcs

In the past year I have changed my lifestyle and have lost over 50 lbs. In the fall of 1994 my L4-5 disc bulged/hernitated and it also affected my right side sciatic nerve. After a hospital stay and 6 months of physio my back was not getting any better. I eventually had to have surgery. I had a discetomy and the L4-4 level and a limited laminectomy posteriorly at this operative site as well. My back seemed better for a few years then started to act up again. In 2002 I had an MRI done and the diagnosis stated theat there was a generalized bulging of the reamaining intervertebral disc at the L4-5 level without evidence of focality. Also, it stated that at the L4-5 level the posterior facet joints demonstrate very early mild symmetric degenerative change. Again, I took things easy, had physio and things seemed to be ok. Fast forward to 2011 and again I am in pain and limited mobility. My days are the worse in the mornings and in the evenings. I purchased a great bed 6 months ago because of my back problems.

medical,"I was on Loestrin 24 Fe for 5 months but my doctor switched me to Lo Loestrin 24 Fe because she thought I needed a lower dose, as I kept getting recurring yeast infections. The first month that I was on Lo Loestrin I got my period, very short and very light for about 2-3 days. This month I delayed my period by a week because I was going on vacation. So when it got to the placebo pill I just took a week of active pills from another pack. However, I just finished my placebo pills (inactive pills) for the month and I have not gotten my period. I only missed one pill, but took it the next day as soon as I remembered and I did not have sex that day or the next. Also, my boyfriend and I do not use condoms but he always pulls out. I took a pregnancy test and it is negative. Is there a chance that I could be pregnant???

medical,my son who is 9 years old has been complaining about stomach aches. This started three weeks ago after he got braces. We gave him tylenol for a couple days after the braces were put on as he was in significant pain. We stopped the tylenol after two days. About three days later he ended up constipated and had significant stomach pain. we had him checked out by a doctor and he was constipated. Over about a week his constipation seemed to be the cause of cramping and stomach pain. It took about four or five days for the constipation to subside and he had pains persistently over those days. He slept fine at night but he complained of pain mysteriously when it was time for school. He ended up missing a week of school. Last week he made it to school but a couple evenings he complained a couple times about stomach pain but he made it to school and seemed to function ok. He had a coupe episodes in the past three days complaining about stomach pain but wehad him lay down a few minutes and he would seem to be fine.

I had sex a few times but my boyfriend pulled out before he did anything and most of the time we used condoms.

Now that I am back home I have started the 4 day break and it has been 2 days and i still only have brown discharge. Is it quite unlikely that I could be pregnant due to the fact i took the pill correctly (usually on time but if not only about an hour late) and that he never came inside me?

I have received bruising after pressing on it. When I bend my arm or flex my bicep it feels like its pushing against my bicep. I am a phlebotomist and draw blood mainly on geriatrics for 7 years.

Its an enzyme people loose  radiation and chemotherapy talk about  old school do a study on what each cancer patient is missing sometimes it does not have to do anything it just has to be their to keep the rest in place  . Yes call me crazy I do not care but long long time ago people believe a simple thing as  a doctors washing their hands before surgery  was a waste of time so I pose to you and your fellow doctors look for the block support of the body if we all carry cancer then our own bodies have the cure sometimes its so simple it is actually looking at you but every one cannot believe it because it goes against whats taught ---Good thing BEES do not believe in the Laws of physics  or they would not fly amazing a big body tinny wings yet it defies all the laws of gravity physics etc imagine if doctors would think in the same path way I wonder you should too all good hiding places are in front of you too see yet blinded by the simplicity of it,lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ELE_mt

Within the last 72 hours she ended up having a stent put in and they plan to leave it there until after the baby is born. She is on the antibiotic Macrobid and I was helping her look up information on this medication. She experienced an unusual discharge (vaginal) this morning - no pain, no blood...no cramps etc. Just a discharge she hasn t seen before and she called me to ask if I thought that was normal. (She is at work) so I looked it up and see that it is possible to have a vaginal discharge while taking macrobid. Question is - without pain, blood, cramps or anything - should she call her OB about the discharge or since she is taking the medication Macrobid and it says vaginal discharge is possible.....should she just see if she continues with this discharge. I also noticed it said not to take this medication while nursing and not to take it during the last 2-4 weeks of pregnancy.

medical,"I am being treated by my dentist for an abscess and have been on antibiotics.  I was scheduled for a root canal today, but I am not able to open my mouth due to swelling and tightness in my jaw.  He indicated that there are times even though the abscess is being treated with antibiotics, the infection can settle into the jaw muscle and cause it to tighten up and that is likely causing the problem.  He prescribed a muscle relaxer to see if that will loosen up the jaw muscle.  I have been taking OTC pain relievers to help with the swelling and pain but wondered if you could tell me if there is a name for this condition and if there is anything else I can do to help myself or help speed up the healing process?  The root canal has been put on hold for a week in the hopes by then I will be able to open my mouth/jaw enough to do the procedure.

medical,"Hi my father retired from the military in 1991 and worked as a pilot out of Nellis Air Force Base for the last 22 years. He retired in May 2012. When he retired he started having inconsistencies with his blood counts. Extremely elevated RBCs that have been unexplainable to doctors. He s had really bad stomach issues for probably the last 15 years. He s been going to see a hematologist oncologist for the last year having his blood drawn many times a week and then reduced to a couple of times a month to reduce his RBC counts. He has been extremely sick for the last year and passed away this past Sunday due to unexplainable causes. My question is, do you think his condition could be due to his two tours in Vietnam as a pilot flying through the agent orange? We are trying to better understand this tragedy. I have noticed a lot of posts on the Internet in relation to elevated red blood cells leaving the physicians scratching their heads. I know he was diagnosed with polycythemia recently.

Just recently as three weeks ago my primary sent me over to a cardiologist as opposed to the cardio surgeon on March of 2014 (this month).

medical,"I am a 50 year old male. Few months ago, I suddenly had pains around both hips and lower abdomen. I ve been walking on the treadmill, on average, 10 miles per week for many years and lately playing cricket (bowling fast like throwing fastball) with my kid. The pain became uncomfortable while driving and when turning sideways while sleeping. I realized quickly the pains had started after playing cricket with my belt tightened so that I did not have to worry about my pants dropping few inches every minute. I had played cricket the previous summer and had none of the symptoms listed above. But I always played wearing the belt a bit loosely. After about a month, the pains slowly went away completely. I continued playing cricket as well as walking on the treadmill. Last weekend, I forgot to loosen up the belt and played cricket for short time and the above listed pains came back right away. I feel the pains I am experiencing are muscular pains but worried that this might be a more serious condition than that, perhaps appendicitis etc. Appreciate any advice or suggestions.

Recently, after a couple weeks of heavy restricting (I m an anorectic) , I d gotten down to my lowest weight at this height (BMI of 18.6) and then I binged one day, the total was about 800-900 calories but I exercised about 600 off, so I wasn t too worried about getting back on track. I heavily restricted the day after that (two days ago) and I found I had gained 2lb. I was trying not to freak out but ended up binging, which brought that day s total to about 1500. All day (pre-binge) I d been having these strange stomach pains that weren t like normal hunger pangs. It was dull ache that began to get worse and worse, like nothing I d ever felt before. In an attempt to calm myself down after my binge I told myself that those pains would probably go away. ....AND I took some Laxatives. And by some I mean 3 when the recommended dosage is 2. Normally when I take laxatives they take 6hrs to take effect and then my bowels release heavily about three times. It s uncomfortable only right before I, er, poo and then it goes away. But the stomach pains got worse and worse and they were topped with shaking, sweating and nausea . Eventually it got so bad I couldn t sleep. Originally I thought the pain had continued because I d eaten so much, but even with the laxatives, nothing I d eaten since that day had, well, come back out. Yesterday I ate 1200 calories to try and increase my metabolic rate . Today, I m still in immense pain, gained ANOTHER 2 pounds, and I don t know what to do.

Also I have severe muscle stiffness and my muscles are achy and weak, I consulted an orthopaedic, and my x-rays were fine, so he said there is no bone problem, and exercise would help reduce my muscle stiffness, should I visit a Rheumatologist, will he be able to help me out.

It hasnt gotten any bigger and Ive had an ultrasound done on it that came back showing it to be non-cancerous.  I also have an enlarged lymph node in my neck/throat just below my jaw line, only on the right side that sometimes swells up and sometimes is normal, but Ive had this too for about 3 years.In about the past year Ive developed a pain in my right shoulder, 99% of the things that I do in my everyday life dont effect it at all.  But I can feel like its slightly swollen/enlarged compared to my left shoulder.  When I raise my right arm above my head like Im pointing to the sky and bring it back down slowly and to the side my shoulder cracks, every single time that I do that motion.Recently, in about the past month Ive started to get a tightness in my chest, almost exclusively associated to the days after I consume alcohol but not only on those days.  Im constantly thinking about these symptoms and second-guessing the ultrasound results.

medical,My mom had small bowel cancer in August. They did a complete tumor resection and now she has pain in her lower left abdomin. They did bone scan and ct scans multiple and didnt see anything. Yesterday she went to see the surgeon and he didnt like the way her belly button area is swollen and sore. He thinks there may be a lump there and wants to remove it. Would abdominal ct scans show a cancerous tumor by her belly button or is it more likely a surgerical hernia? Is the belly button surgery difficult to recover from?

He lived with our father for a couple years, and rarely came out of his bedroom. Now he has decided our father is trying to kill him and is moving back in with our mom. He is 32 years old, 6 feet tall, and about 180 pounds. He has no medical issues (other than this). Is there anything we can do? Is there any information you can share?

medical,My daughter is 14 months old and has been 8kg since she was 8 months old. She refused solids until she was 12 months old. She has been eating (very fussy) for the last 6 weeks but still no weight gain. She was put on Osmolax by her ped as she is terribly constipated 6 weeks ago. She started eating once the osmolax started her pooing. In the last 2 weeks she has started refusing food again. I have also noticed that the osmolax doesn t seem to be working as well and we will need to put her dose up again soon to continue her pooing. This is worrying as she is so little and the laxatives can t be good for her. She seems to have not a lot of interest in food. She was exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months but never even seemed that interested in breast milk either. She also gets a rash on her face when she starts to refuse food. She scratches it a lot and we put steroids cream on it to calm it down. We have also noticed her gums and mouth bleed a lot for no apparent reason. Our ped got her cheeks swabbed to test for the celiac gene and her cheeks bled from the gentle brush of the swab.,lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",MUQ3Hx

I am consulting another physician yet need advice now before I literally go insane. My levels have been.... 12/27/2010 2983 12/29/2000 I was not told a number just that they were down about 200, and that i was loosing the baby. 12/30/2010 4100 1/05/2010 7990.

medical,"Hi, My dad is 60 years old and his \""Nerves are Bad\"", or at least thats what he calls it. When he was a teenager he was put into a mental hospital because of his panic attacks. They treated him poorly and gave him a very powerful medication that had unwelcome side effects and did not help. Because of this he refuses to see a doctor. He has been on social security/disability ever since and has not been able to hold a job my entire life. My father avoids most social situations and any situation where he may have to speak to someone and answer questions, in fact, I must be careful speaking with him, because even discussing the possibility of a job interview or a doctors visit can trigger a panic attack. He even gets incredibly irritable, nervous, anxious and angry if a stranger like a tax consultant or insurance broker or someone will be coming to the house later. I have noticed that when forced to be social, a few beers is all it takes for him to act pretty much normal. He is still a bit shy, but no panic attacks, and he will even tell jokes and perhaps even make friends. This tells me that the condition must be treatable (although obviously not with alcohol). Other symptoms include shaking his feet a lot and vigorously rubbing his hands together. He also would spend a lot of time pacing around the house drinking coffee. Now that he is getting older I am extra worried about his health since he is afraid to see a doctor so I am looking for somewhere to turn.

Other medications such as Nambumetone, Naproxen, Cyclobenziprine, Amitriptyline, Prednisone, as well as several others were not effective. I am an electrician and I do a lot of tasks that are posture compromising. I am often required to crane my neck for extended periods, ( a recent pain management Dr did not know what craning of the neck meant) I have to access crawl spaces and attics. I have to manually bend conduit, and work overhead. I have to work above suspended ceilings off of a ladder, outstretching and reaching to pass wires along, By days end I am in agony. I am unable to get my current primary care physician to prescribe the one medication that works for me. Oxycodone.. I am aware of the dependency risks. I am also aware of some of the warnings that come with the medications they are so freely willing to give me. Shouldn t the decision be mine as to which risks I am willing to take. Nambumetone for example has risks of gastric bleeding, increased incidence of stroke and a slew of other possible side effects. The Amitriptyline has been shied away from for years as an anti depressant because of far safer forms of antidepressants currently available, yet they are more than willing to let me take it for neuropathic pain, even-though it is ineffective. How does one approach a physician about prescribing Oxycodone, without appearing as someone seeking it for less than honest reasons? I genuinely benefit from the 10 mg dose. It worked wonders the 8 months I was on it. it worked so well I opted not to have the additional fusion surgery recommended after my 2/10/13 accident.. When I opted out of having the 2nd fusion surgery the surgeon subsequently ceased prescribing the oxycodone & told me to get it from my PCP who is unwilling to prescribe it, and now I am once again contemplating having the surgery. I actually had the most productive 8 months in over 5 years while taking Oxycodone. My pain was managed, my pain associated depression was non existent, I functioned at work, and got things done at home after a day at work. Now I just barely make it through the day, and when I get home I am a couch potato, to sore to do anything. . YYYY@YYYY",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",iLXaLQ

medical,"Hello, I am a 52yr old female. Average height and weight. I have had a total hysterectomy in 2006. I by chance had a d dimer ran about a year ago now and it was at 900. Thinking this was maybe this was my normal. They checked it again in a couple of weeks and it was 1,200 then 1,800, then 2,200 and as of yesterday it is 2,656. I have been to see Oncologist who ran multiple tests including CT of chest and US of legs. US was negative. CT shows two lung nodules and I will have another CT next month. I also have a positive ANA with an RNP antibody of greater than 8. I was sent to a Rheumatologist for this and that apt was a joke. He told me I didn t have Lupus and that was it. I am very concerned that I have a blood clot forming somewhere in my body that will break off and either give me a stroke, heart attack or aneurism. Any thoughts on why my d dimer is increasing. Any advise or response would be greatly appreciated. I do work in a lab and have been informed that it may be a blood clot. I have back pain and seem to catch myself breathing at a rapid rate without exertion. Please advise. Thank you.",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zoOxII
medical,"What are the symptoms of an elevated ammonia level? My 30yr old son takes Depakote for a seizure disorder and bi-polar he also has autism, so I can t ask him about how he feels. For the past few weeks he has been very tired, clumsy, his eyes are beginning to take on a yellow hue though no one seems to notice this but me, and he has black circles under his eyes. All the usual suspects have been ruled out, infection, anemia etc. I was just sitting here at dinner watching fall asleep at the table and the thought popped into my head perhaps his ammonia level is elevated.
