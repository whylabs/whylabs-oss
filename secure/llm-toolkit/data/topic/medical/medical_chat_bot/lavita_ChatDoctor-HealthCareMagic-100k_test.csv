medical,"I have a lump on my shoulder blade For the past several months it has been hard, about the size of a small marble and not painful. However in the last few days it has increased by at least 4 times in size, the area is hot to the touch and is extremely painful. What do I need to ask my doctor tomorrow if I can get in to see him? What kind of specialist might handle this? How do you tell if it is a cyst or something more serious?

medical,"I have been having issues with body aches and pains as if a Mac tuck has run me over. Face and neck swelling (currently on the right side of face). Lymph nodes in neck are enlarged. Lymph nodes under arms and between legs hurt. Tingling and numbness in a variety place on my body, especially hands and feet. Every time I eat my bones hurt worse. Headaches, chest pains on occasion. I went to my GP he ran blood work and said I had elevated test on the Epstein Barr Virus, which I now know I have. But I m concerned what else might be wrong with me. GP has asked that I do a Ultrasound of Abdomen due to the strange issue of me eating and being in extreme pain. When I do eat, my belly swells and it tender on both the left and right side. I have constant constipation. He is also sending me to a GI doctor to check into this more. The other biggest issue is the newest revelation, huge bruises on the back of my legs / calves.

I have no none food allergies and have stopped eating and drinking everything that I think could be a contributing cause. Oddly, I had been craving tomato juice for weeks and couldn t get enough. That has passed. Also have been experiencing some odd discomfort at the base of my skull that seems to coincide with a weird sensation in my arms and hands. This has been going on for about six weeks. The rash seems to worsen during the evening with no triggers and is helped by lotion. The rash is more like welts than prickly heat and is not a wet rash.

medical,"Is it normal to have a swollen lymph node for 6 months? Hi, I am a 20 years old female. I have had a painless lump or swollen lymph node that has been in my neck for six 6 months now since December 2010 that can only be felt, but not seen. The lymph node is no bigger than the size of a half a dime and feels like a swollen kidney bean that keeps changing in size from small to big and then smaller again, but it never fully goes away. In terms of texture I cant tell if its firm, soft or hard. Its hard to tell. Anyway, I finally went to my doctor in early April 2011 to get it checked out and he put me on a weeks worth of antibiotics, and prescribed me some allergy and asthma medication. He also did a chest X-ray and blood test that came back normal. When I went back to my doctor he said that the lymph node had shrunk and that was a good sign and that it might have really been an infection. So he told me to observe it for a month and come back to check it out and if its still there he will send me for a biopsy. So far the lymph node is STILL there and it feels like it enlarged back a little, but that might be because I keep picking at it from worrying so much. So far I dont have any symptoms of fevers, night sweats, fatigue, persistent itching, or unexplained weight loss, in fact I gained ALOT of weight from anxiety and stress eating from the fear of this being lymphoma or some other cancer.

medical,A rash appeared on my butt a couple weeks ago. the rash was very red but not painful and not that itchy. there were bright red blotches. the rash was confined to the center of my butt cheeks where my anus is but did not go inside my crack or elsewhere. it appeared after a night of heavy drinking (beer). A few days earlier I had unprotected vaginal sex. i went to my doctor who was unsure of what it was but said it was most likely contact dermatitis and prescribes a steroid cream and said to come back if it spread. 2 weeks later the rash had basically healed and i woke up with what looks like a cluster of mosquitoe bites in the same area. 2 days after another night of drinking beer. this rash is not the same as before as it resembles mosquito bites insteas of the bright red rash i had before but it seems as though it is spreading when i scratch it. it is far itchier this time as well. any ideas as to what this may be?,lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DC_Eas

medical,I am just trying to understand where my back pain is coming from. I feel at the end of 2011 and have had progressing problems ever since.. I had a MRI done 2 yrs ago...it says at L2-3 there is a 1.8mm left lateral disc protrusion that causes mild to moderate left sided foraminal stenosis...At L3-4 there is a 1.4mm Left lateral disc protrusion. this causes mild to moderate foraminal stenosis. At L4-5 there is a 1.5mm bulging disc and facet hypertrophy. this causes mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis...At L5-S1 there is a 1.5mm bulging disc and facet hypertrophy this causes canal and mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. I went to a few drs they told me nothing was wrong. I had sent my images to the lazer surgery center and they told me that I would need a fusion in this world but that drs would help me...I have been to 3 different nuerosuregons..the last one sent me for a myleogram because I have a spinal stimulator that does not work and he told me that I only have one slight bulging disc and hes not sure where my pain is coming from and to modify my stimulator. My pain management dr told me from my MRI looked like I had a few herinated discs...he then touched my SI joint and I jumped so I know that there is an issue there and he wants to do injections. So what does this MRI tell me? Do u think that the Nuerosuregon is not being completely honest because he doesn t want to do anything because I am too young? The pain is getting progressivly worse and what he is telling me that the Myleogram says does not mesh with my mri or what I feel. My symptoms are like sharp pain in my lower back. Im at an 8 pain all the time. I do get soreness down my butt.. I feel like my nerves are pinched causing leg aches. I haven t gotten any better just worse and we are going on a few yrs. I cant work cuz I can t sit up at a desk like I used to. I also have Fibromaylgia. So any info that u can give me would help.

Last cycle i went in for fertility treatment and was treated with 100 mg clomid for 5 days + 150 mg Gonal F for 3 days + 225 mg Gonal F for 4 days and on Day 15 was given a trigger shot. But i did not conceive. I also had mild OHSS. THis cycle i visited another doctor on Day 15 of my cycle. He gave me 60 ml of some injectable to release the egg from a follicle 18 mm in size. he said it is not ChatDoctor . what can it be? Also in the scan he said one follicle is leftover from last time and one is new. Is it possible for him to know this if he hasnt seen the previous scans?

medical,Hi I am a 27yr old Female suffering from bladder and kidney reflux aswell as severe kidney problems .I have been going through this disease for 6 years now. It started off as severe continual kidney infections which I was hospitalised for each time and doctors could not explain why I was continually getting infections. The infections were always in my left hand side Kidney which always showed on ultra sounds as large and swollen ( Hydronephrosis). I was then hospitalised with severe pain on the left hand side flank pain ( front kidney pain) whicChatDoctore up on an ultrasound and CT scan as a Large PUJ Obstruction( a kink in ureter tube which is the tube that comes of your kidney and joins to your bladder) I had numerous stents put in to release obstruction which was only a temporally fix as I was getting infections in stents. I was then booked in by a urologist to have a pleyoplasty surgery done on my left hand kidney. At this time my right hand kidney only had a mild case of Hydronephrosis on it and a propionate renal pelvis with no PUJ Obstruction on it so the concentration was mainly on my left hand kidney. The pleyoplasty went well and urologists were convinced that my condition was fixed. Exactly to the day a year after my surgery my left hand completely obstructed again and I was hospitalised 7 times to the emergency department with extreme pain in 2 weeks I had multiple scans and nuclear medicine studies done which showed my left hand kidney completely obstructed they then booked me in for a ballon dilation which was unsuccessful and I was in the public hospital system as I had no health insurance so waiting times were very long I was put on very high pain killers to get me through the day and waiting times I then reached out to a different urologist which rushed me in for a procedure which inserted a camera inside my bladder and kidney to have a look they also inserted another stent and booked me in for yet another pleyoplasty which this time was a larger operation. This operation was not successful and I was told that my left hand kidney had to be removed I was devastated but I knew it had to be done. I was ok for about 6 months after the removal then the same things started happening to my remanding kidney but it was obstructing and releasing they were stumped I was in and out of hospital all the time with severe fluid retention and pain. I was hospitalised for 3 weeks to have numerous tests done to find out why this was happening. I had a urodyamics test done which shows the pressure in your bladder and how you empty your bladder. It was then I was diagnosed with a rare bladder condition which doesn t have a name all I was told is I have extreme pressure in my bladder and when I go to the toilet I only empty a 1/4 of what is in my bladder and the rest reflux back up into my kidney which is causing my bladder to blow out my remanding kidney. I was then told I wasn t eligible for a transplant as my bladder would damage any donor kidney I received. I need help and it has taken along time for me to feel comfortable to talk about my disease as I know there are a lot more people out there with worst disease then mine. I was just wondering if there are any other people out there suffering from similar problems and have had it fixed as I am having difficulties finding surgical help or if anybody needs to talk about their health issues as I know it s hard to deal with severe health problems not only health wise but mentally as severe continuos pain can make people feel like they are going insane. I try to wake up every morning and stay positive and smile through the pain and feeling unwell all the time. I can not work due to my health issues and it gets me down all the time but I stay positive and hope there is light at the end of the tunnel.,lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",McqoIy

I thought my head was going to explode with static. This was the first time I d ever felt anything quite like this. Now you can see static on a tv, hear it on a radio, and even touch it on old cathode ray tv screens. This stuff across my brain felt just like the tv screen just much stronger, It was located on my temples and at the bottom of my right ear. But a few years ago a the height of my sleep paralysis Horror (Everynight multiple times for around 3 solid months) I finally went to the doctor, and got given citalopram, for depression. Started taking the citalopram, and i turned into a zombie, and these strange static fizzy buzzes started appearing. Now every bout of SP is preceded by and accompanied with this static.

First off i am 25 years old and i have 3 little boys. I am constantly fighting with my Husband over stupid things. I tend to cry alot when he says something to me that is not even mean. I also tend to tnrow things when i get angry and just hollar for no reason at all. My moods change frequently and i dont know why. One minute i will be watching tv very happy and the next i feel very irritable and crabby and that i have to do something. I feel sad most of the time and i do not sleep very good at night. just having my hair touch my face wrong sets me off. I would like to be able to discuss issues with my husband but every time we try it seems that i become very angry and start hollering and crying and thinking that i am the worst person in the world. I love my boys very much and i get very angry at them to the point where i feel annoyed and want to scream. I have really bad hot flashes, feel very lazy most of the time with spurts of uncontrollable energy. I see a doctor on the 14th but i just want an opinion of what to expect. I never give myself credit for anything and i constantly feel like whatever i am doing is wrong. I am just tired of my spurts affecting me being happy and letting my family be happy also. please let me know what you think. thank you",lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RK4B7C

medical,years ago I noticed heart palpitations which led to panis attacks because they scared me 30 years later dealing with them ive noticed a link to them.the question is I believe the main trigger is in the garden vegetables from the store.I know this sounds a little bit reaching but I told my wife to lay off the frozen vegetables and they have decreased dramatically could there be a link or could it be the pesticides causing the to re-surface.ive tried to live with them for years and wished they woulg go away.yes its true anxiety and palptations are related but why would they dramatically increase.ive also notice when my blood pressure is a little higher than normal I dont have palpitations at all.so why would my blood pressure being around normal cause me to have them and being a little higher not have them.why would eating vegetables cause me to have them alot.its hard to find a medium area but since ive laid off the vegetables its bearable.ive tried everything humanlly possible.I guess if I never felt my heart beating would probably cure me.I also use to be a track runner in school years ago long distance runner is it possible that the excessive running triggered them?just searching for answers thank you.,lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vaiED_

Let me start by saying I already sought medical attention, today actually, I went to the ER and I told them (what I m about to tell you) what I was experiencing, and they literally completely ignored my problem and only investigated into vaginal discharge they discovered upon examination. I went in because last night when I was about to take a bath, I noticed a small fleshy piece hanging from my vagina (yeah, sorry this is personal, and I feel strange asking, but clearly the ER doctors thought it was nothing yet neglected to ease my mind and let me know what it was). I was not experiencing any pain (until they did the examination and am now a little soar, which is somewhat common for me after such examinations) it s just something I have never seen before and because I am approximately 3 months pregnant it REALLY freaked me out. I have been sexually active since I was about 16 years old, and I googled what I could only describe as fleshy piece of skin hanging from vagina and everyone online seems to think it s the hymen or cherry. This answer doesn t make sense to me because I obviously had multiple sexual relations, and I bled on my first time.

medical,"I am a 52-year-old woman, 155 pounds, 5 7 , and I have several health issues, but one that remains a mystery, and that is extremely uncomfortable, is the discomfort I have in my upper abdomen when I exert myself. This is a sensation of extreme pressure in the area of my diaphragm, like I am having the wind knocked out of me, and is most extreme when I am climbing stairs or doing anything that elevates my heart rate. I can no longer do aerobic activity because of it, and I would like to be able to work my body, but this condition won t allow it. This sensation occurs right in the middle, just underneath my ribs. It feels like my stomach has been replaced with a brick--it feels weighty. I also get mildly nauseated, and it doesn t matter if I have eaten or not. It happens on an empty stomach as much as it does on a full stomach. It feels as if I ve eaten a huge meal and can t catch my breath, even if I haven t. There is also pain that I would rate anywhere between a 3 and a 6. The pain can also extend to closer to where the pancreas is, and while I have had a few cases of acute pancreatitis in the past, my blood work has not shown to be positive for it since 1996. The other mysterious thing that nobody seems to have an answer to is that I wake up in the morning with a thin lower torso, but I put a few inches on in fluid throughout the day. This is not ascites - it is all in the tissue, under the skin, surrounding my abdomen and back. This has happened every single day for the last five years, and is also worse upon exertion. High temperature can bring it on and exacerbate it too. It s so frustrating, and I have been called a hypochondriac numerous times. I was even yelled at by an ER physician when I went in with extreme PACs and a combo of bradycardia & tachycardia that wouldn t abate - something that occurs a few times a year and that makes me have to go into the ER for i.v. Lopressor. These are the things I know for sure (and I ve been tested for many, many things). I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, Ptosis (which is worse first thing in the morning but usually goes away after time), and I sometimes get these little painful blisters on my upper abdomen, under breasts, on my knees and elbows. They are red and full of liquid and very painful. They last just one or two days, and then they are little painful scabs. They flare up fairly often - usually I get them once or twice a month. Cholesterol is 240 (I ve brought it down from 283 with diet change and fish oil). I have some connective tissue issues (hypermobility and possibly Ehlers Danlos, which my daughter was diagnosed with too) and possibly Sjogren s Syndrome (Schirmer test result is 0 and I get frequent salivary gland pain and swelling, very dry mouth, and several other symptoms) although ANA tests are negative. I had a spot removed from my chest which was positive for Lupus, however, a subsequent biopsy on normal skin from the same area was negative. I also have frequent inflammation of the medial epicondyle and it s quite painful, and painful swelling in other joints. Tests for inflammation are also negative but I was diagnosed with arthritis. I have, what a couple doctors have called Myotonia, but others dispute it. When I squeeze my hand tightly for several seconds, then relax, my fingers stay gripped. They will relax over time, or I can open them with my other hand. The doctor who diagnosed it was a primary care physician, and she observed my daughter and I both showing her, and she used the little hammer and tapped on the muscle near my thumb, which caused the thumb to cramp up. However, muscle testing was negative. I get a combination of PACs, bradycardia, and tachycardia, that leaves me unable to function because I have near-syncope when it happens. I have had three major episodes in the last twelve months or so that required ER trips and i.v. Lopressor to fix it. The first time it happened that extreme was in February of 2012 and I ve had three like that since. They don t know why it happens, but I ve had heart rhythm issues for years. An ablation didn t fix it. I have frequent flare-ups that leave me unable to perform daily tasks or work on a regular basis so I have had to go on disability, which I hate. I would like to have my life back. I would also like to find a doctor who can help me figure out this mystery, which has robbed me of so much time. I can t do the things I used to do and I am kind of afraid of the daily edema, which is uncomfortable in itself. I want to find a doctor who will not look at me like I m a freak who is making it all up. I m not. Here are some pictures of the edema in my torso.

Anyhow, it bled for hours, even though I was using gauze properly for 30-40 minute periods.  Finally, all blood stopped.  However, I dont think I have a clot.  I have seen clots before and this doesnt look like my many other extractions.  I shined a flashlight on it and it is brown, white and flat.  There is no hole in the extraction site, but its not a clot either.  Should I go back to the oral surgeon tomorrow or should I wait two days.
