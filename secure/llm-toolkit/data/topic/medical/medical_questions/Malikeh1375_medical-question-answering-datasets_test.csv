medical,"Bacterial biofilms are linked with chronic infections and have properties distinct from planktonic, single-celled bacteria. The virulence mechanisms associated with Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are becoming better understood. Human neutrophils are critical for the innate immune response to S. aureus infection. Here we describe two virulence strategies that converge to promote the ability of S. aureus biofilms to evade killing by neutrophils. Specifically, we show that while neutrophils exposed to S. aureus biofilms produce extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytose bacteria, both mechanisms are inefficient in clearance of the biofilm biomass. This is attributed to the leukocidin LukAB, which promotes S. aureus survival during phagocytosis. We also show that the persistence of biofilm bacteria trapped in NETs is facilitated by S. aureus nuclease (Nuc)-mediated degradation of NET DNA. This study describes key aspects of the interaction between primary human neutrophils and S. aureus biofilms and provides insight for how S. aureus evades the neutrophil response to cause persistent infections.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zmBAIg

medical,"OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to evaluate the impact of a stay-at-home order on stroke metrics during the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group). RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19. We conclude that cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in AIS patients with COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",bFEQ8k

medical,"The aims of the current study were to identify Mycoplasma suis antigens and develop a multiplex microbead immunoassay (MIA). A M. suis-expression library was screened for immunogens using sera from infected pigs. Based on bioinformatics, putative antigens were identified within positive inserts; gene fragments were expressed and purified as polyhistidine fusion proteins, and immunoreactivity was confirmed by Western blot. Selected antigens were used to develop a MIA. Sera from noninfected and infected pigs were used to set the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) cutoffs and as positive controls, respectively. Assay specificity was tested using sera from pigs seropositive for other pathogens (2 different pigs seropositive for each pathogen). Samples from 51 field pigs and 2 pigs during the course of acute (pig 1) and chronic (pig 2) infections were tested using MIA, indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Sixteen reactive plaques (52 genes) were detected. A heat-shock protein (GrpE), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), and 4 proteins from paralogous gene families (PGFs) were identified as antigens by Western blot. While GrpE, GAPN, and 1 PGF protein were strong antigens, the others were not suitable as MIA targets. A MIA using GrpE, GAPN, and the strongly reactive PGF protein was developed. Cross-reactivity with sera from pigs infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Porcine circovirus-2, Porcine parvovirus, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine respiratory coronavirus with this MIA was not observed. Pig 2 was consistently positive by MIA and qPCR, whereas pig 1, initially negative, seroconverted before becoming qPCR positive. Only 2 samples (from pig 1) were IHA positive. Five (9.8%) field samples were qPCR positive and 40 (78.43%) were positive for all 3 MIA antigens; however, all were IHA negative. In summary, the MIA is specific and more sensitive than qPCR and IHA, providing simultaneous evaluation of antibody response to M. suis antigens.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Btrgqf

medical,"AIM The objective of this study was to assess the impact of health care-initiated visits versus patient-controlled flexible visits on clinical and patient-reported outcomes in people with type 1 diabetes. METHODS The DiabetesFlex trial was a randomized controlled, pragmatic non-inferiority 15-month follow-up study comparing standard care (face-to-face visits every four months) with DiabetesFlex (patient-controlled flexible visits using patient-reported outcomes-based telehealth follow-up). Of 343 enrolled participants, 160 in each group completed the study. The primary outcome was mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 15-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were blood pressure, lipid levels, frequency of visits, the World Health Organization score - five well-being-index (WHO-5), the Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID) scale and experience of participation in own care (participation score). RESULTS The adjusted mean difference in HbA1c between standard care and DiabetesFlex was similar and below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.4%(-0.03%[95%CI:0.15,0.11]/-0.27 mmol/mol[-1.71,1.16]). No intergroup mean changes in lipid or blood pressure were observed. Conversely, DiabetesFlex participants presented an increased mean WHO-5 index of 4.5 (1.3,7.3), participation score of 1.1 (0.5,2.0), and decreased PAID score of -4.8 (-7.1,-2.6) when compared with standard care. During follow-up, DiabetesFlex participants actively changed 23% of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations, cancelled more visits (17% vs. 9%), and stayed away without cancellation less often (2% vs. 8%). CONCLUSION Compared with standard care, flexible patient-controlled visits combined with patient-reported outcomes in participants with metabolic controlled type 1 diabetes and good psychological well-being further improved diabetes-related well-being and decreased face-to-face visits while maintaining safe diabetes management.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dCJXVQ

The primary outcomes were the AF burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the association of the pandemic with AF occurrence, as compared with 1 year prior. The secondary outcome was the association of AF occurrence with per-state COVID-19 prevalence. During COVID-19, 10 346 CIEDs with an atrial lead were monitored. There were 16 570 AF episodes of &#8805;6 min transmitted (16 events per 1000 patient days) with a significant increase in proportion of patients with AF episodes in high COVID-19 prevalence states compared with low prevalence states [odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.48, P < 0.001]. There were significantly more AF episodes during COVID-19 compared with Control [incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P < 0.001]. This relationship persisted for AF episodes &#8805;1 h (IRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.53-1.79, P < 0.001) and &#8805;6 h (IRR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the first 100 days of COVID-19, a 33% increase in AF episodes occurred with a 34% increase in the proportion of patients with AF episodes observed in states with higher COVID-19 prevalence. These findings suggest a possible association between pandemic-associated social disruptions and AF in patients with CIEDs.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the relationships between fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), spiritual well‐being (SWB) and psychological resilience in breast cancer survivors during the COVID‐19 outbreak, and investigates to what extent breast cancer survivors’ sociodemographic characteristics affect FCR, SWB and psychological resilience levels. METHODS: The study was conducted at Canakkale University Hospital in Turkey. Included in the study were 82 non‐metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes were followed‐up after primary treatment, but suspended due to the COVID‐19 outbreak. FCR, SWB and psychological resilience were assessed using the FCR inventory‐short form (FCRI‐SF), SWB scale and the brief resilience scale (BRS), respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of breast cancer survivors concerning FCR, SWB, and psychological resilience were 17.77 ± 5.38, 36.20 ± 6.21 and 20.01 ± 4.51, respectively. A significant negative correlation was noted between the scores of FCR and SWB and psychological resilience (r = −0.329, p < 0.001 and r = −0.316, p = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, a significantly positive correlation was identified between psychological resilience and SWB (r = 0.501, p = 0.003). A hierarchical linear regression analysis with FCRI‐SF as the dependent variable, and SWB and BRS as explanatory variables, indicated that SWB affects FCRI‐SF scores and is a potential predictor of FCR. A mediation analysis revealed that SWB partially mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and FCR. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors with high SWB and psychological resilience scores experience less FCR, despite their failure to maintain the medical follow‐up due to the COVID‐19 outbreak. Efforts should be made to increase the psychological resilience and SWB of patients diagnosed with breast cancer.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",CnEj82

medical,"Background: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia continues to affect the whole world including major countries such as China, USA, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. We present outcome (’recovered’, ’isolated’ or ’death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ’early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method: Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest Neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ’country’, ’age’ and ’gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ’disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results: The use of a patient’s ’disease’ history improves the prediction of ’death’ by more than 7-fold. The models ignoring a patent’s ’disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ’disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",l_yfSQ

medical,"Clinical laboratories face ethical challenges on a daily basis. The ethics training provided for clinical laboratory staff is variable, with some receiving no training. We aimed to explore the perceived benefits of ethics education for laboratory professionals. Ethics training was provided to approximately 60 laboratory professionals in a UK not-for-profit blood cancer organisation, with group discussions incorporated into the session. The session covered dominant ethical theories and principles, the defining moments in medical research ethics and the ethical aspects of laboratory practices. At the end of the session a short optional paper survey was distributed to the participants to obtain feedback on the training. The feedback was anonymous and thematically coded. Attendees reported to be more aware of the existence and importance of ‘everyday’ ethics in their workplace. Responses also showed that the training session had provided participants with an opportunity for ethical reflection in themselves and in discussion with their colleagues. Despite clinical laboratory professionals being faced with ethical challenges daily, there is comparatively little ethics education provided. Ethics training is believed to improve the ethical attitude of laboratory staff and help them when making decisions in their work. We have shown that ethics education is important for laboratory professionals to develop and retain ethical awareness, and ethical reflection. By gaining insight into the ethical aspects of their practices, laboratory professionals can apply this understanding when faced with making challenging decisions in their workplace, in order to act in the best interests of their patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",R_Dzib

medical,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most universal shared stressor for the general United States (U.S) population in many decades. Due to the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19, no existing questionnaires can comprehensively measure the multi-faceted psychological effects attributable to this health crisis. This study aimed to validate a measure for that purpose. METHODS: A 16-item questionnaire, the Pandemic Emotional Impact Scale (PEIS), was designed and subjected to initial validation in an internet survey completed by a nationally representative sample of 1500 adults living in the U.S. This survey was completed between May 18 and May 30, 2020, during the height of the pandemic’s impact on society. RESULTS: The PEIS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.94) and Guttman split-half reliability (0.95). Exploratory factor analysis suggested two sub-scales -- emotional impact and pragmatic worries -- but these were highly correlated with the overall scale score suggesting that the total score can be used in most cases. The PEIS demonstrated good concurrent validity via robust positive correlations with anxiety, depression and stress, and negative correlations with quality of life and happiness. Criterion validity was supported by the finding that individuals who reported employment loss or loss of income due to the pandemic, had experienced COVID-19 infection in their household, or knew somebody personally who died from the pandemic, had elevated scores on the PEIS. CONCLUSIONS: The PEIS questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument that addresses a significant unmet need for a research instrument that can comprehensively measure pandemic-related effects on the emotional wellbeing of individuals in the U.S population.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EwoF7I

The objectives were to describe the barriers, beliefs, and attitudes in the application of EBP among university health professionals (not doctors) and to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic among them. (2) Methods: This prospective study is both descriptive and observational. The individuals under study were university health professionals (not doctors) from various autonomous regions within Spain, in both public and private spheres. Sociodemographic and labor-related variables linked to the research and its completion were studied. Likewise, the survey instrument Health Sciences Evidence-Based Practice questionnaire (HS-EBP) was administered to evaluate the barriers to, beliefs in, and attitudes towards evidence-based practice. (3) Results: A total of 716 responses were gathered, of which 387 were collected during the period of confinement, and 343 in the COVID-19 post-confinement period. Possible associations that might help respond to the objectives were explored through a correlational study between the sociodemographic variables and each sub-scale of the HS-EBP 30 questionnaire (n = 716). (4) Conclusions: Barriers to, beliefs in, and attitudes towards evidence-based practice are described. There is a leadership gap where line management provides insufficient motivation to follow work routines. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense stress among health professionals.

medical,"INTRODUCTION Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACGME recommended all interviews for the 2021 residency application cycle be held virtually. Since this is major shift from neurosurgical interviews in past years, this study aims to evaluate both applicant and interviewer satisfaction of conducting interviews virtually. METHODS For faculty, an 11-question online survey was sent to 116 United States neurosurgery training programs. A 14-question online survey was sent to 255 neurosurgery applicants. The resulting data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS From applicants, 118 responses were received. From faculty, 171 individual responses were received. Thirty-five percent (34.7%) of applicants agreed that they were satisfied with the virtual interview process as a whole. While 44.5% of faculty disagreed with the statement ""I would like to replace in-person interviews with virtual interviews in the future"", 57.3% of faculty agreed that they were likely to implement virtual interviews in the future. CONCLUSION While some things might be better assessed through in-person interviews, there are clear benefits to virtual interviews. Future iterations of the interview process, incorporating virtual interviews, might help determine how and in which situations virtual interviews can be utilized in future residency application cycles.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GOWEvB

medical,"To realize a sustainable transportation system, it is necessary to estimate the environmental load caused by transportation. Here transportation demand affects carbon dioxide emissions directly. In general, traffic simulations or scenario-based evaluations have been used to predict transportation demand. However, the COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 has changed transportation demand drastically, and such changes have not been considered in conventional simulation models. Therefore, it is important to quantify the impact of the pandemic on transportation demand and its magnitude. In this study, we developed a model focused on describing the changes in transportation demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We developed a model using system dynamics because this method is effective in describing socio-technical systems such as transportation demand. Based on related studies, we categorized transportation demand by purpose and modeled it based on the cause-and-effect relationship between the amount of transportation and the prevalence of infectious diseases. To verify the developed model, we compared actual data of 2020 in Japan with the output of the model. We set scenarios with varying parameter values that contribute significantly to changes in transportation demand, such as individual awareness of the pandemic. As a result, the developed model was verified at the behavioral level. This model can be used in developing future transportation systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

medical,"AIM Rural-targeted postgraduate medical training is a key factor associated with entering rural practice. Rural health professionals often experience geographical and professional isolation, which can impact their training and education. In New Zealand, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an established distance postgraduate rural medical programme replaced its in-person residentials with virtual workshops. This study aimed to gain insights into the student experience of the virtual workshops, with emphasis on exploring the effects of the absence of an in-person component. METHOD Qualitative exploratory design. All students who had completed a semester one 2020 University of Otago rural postgraduate module were invited by email to participate. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted by video-conference. A thematic analysis was conducted using a general inductive approach. RESULTS Three themes captured the main issues. 1. Making sure everyone is in the same boat: the key roles of an in-person component were identified as consolidation of learning, benchmarking and connectedness. 2. Learning but not connecting: virtual workshops were well facilitated, allowed continuation of study and the convenience of staying home, however connectedness faded. 3. We've got to keep a human touch in a digital age: looking beyond the pandemic, opportunities for streamlining virtual content were identified, however there was concern around diminished communication and cultural aspects of learning and the absent connection with rural health services and communities. CONCLUSION A virtual workshop is valuable in the COVID-19 environment but does not replace an in-person component of a distance postgraduate training programme for rural medicine.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1gj3XV

medical,"PROBLEM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could affect health service provision of less urgent interventions, such as peritoneal dialysis for chronic kidney disease patients. APPROACH: To assess how peritoneal dialysis centres in Thailand adapted their provision of care, we invited medical directors and peritoneal dialysis managers to respond to an online survey on 1 July 2021. We asked whether they had modified or deferred their training, catheter insertion or removal, intravenous supplements, follow-up and home visits, and workload. LOCAL SETTING: Patients needing dialysis receive peritoneal dialysis free of charge in Thailand. As of 31 December 2020, 240 peritoneal dialysis centres in Thailand have provided care to 32 284 patients. RELEVANT CHANGES: At 24.6% (29/118) of centres, educational sessions for patients were modified. Catheter insertion continued at 71.9% (82/114) of centres. Few facilities (19.7%; 23/117) continued to perform peritoneal equilibration tests as usual. On-site intravenous injections were mostly transferred to health centres close to the patients’ homes. Most centres reduced their outpatient follow-up visits (51.7%; 61/118) and stopped visiting patients at home (66.9%; 79/118). Peritoneal dialysis nurses reported an increased workload at 62.7% (74/118) of centres, and in many instances (66.1%; 78/118) were providing nursing care to COVID-19 patients and administering COVID-19 vaccines. LESSONS LEARNT: Health-care providers altered clinical care activities to protect their patients from COVID-19. However, further evidence is needed on the consequences of such alteration in care. To prepare for future pandemics, actors need to explore nonconventional peritoneal dialysis care as well as financial and nonfinancial incentive mechanisms for such care.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Sw2xad

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about how people who have abortions describe high-quality interpersonal care in Argentina. This qualitative study aimed to understand preferences and priorities in their interactions with providers. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with people who obtained abortions at a comprehensive reproductive health clinic or with support from a feminist accompaniment group in Buenos Aires and Neuquén, Argentina. We iteratively coded transcripts using a thematic analysis approach based on interpersonal domains present in current quality of care frameworks. RESULTS: Participants described high-quality abortion care as feeling acompañamiento and contención from their providers – terms that imply receiving kind, caring, compassionate and emotionally supportive care throughout their abortion. They described four key elements of interpersonal interactions: attentive communication from providers and accompaniers, clear and understandable information provision, non-judgmental support, and individualized options for pain management. CONCLUSIONS: People obtaining abortions in Argentina consistently identified receiving compassionate and supportive care throughout an abortion as a key aspect of care. The findings have implications for incorporating people’s perspectives in the development of care guidelines, training of providers, and monitoring and improving of services. This is particularly important as the government of Argentina prepares to expand legal access to abortion.

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is highly expressed in cancer cells and enhances cancer proliferation and chemoresistance. It is therefore considered a potential target for cancer treatment. However, a chemical compound that directly regulates PGRMC1 has not been identified. Here, we showed that the natural active compound in licorice, glycyrrhizin (GL), directly binds to heme-dimerized PGRMC1 to inhibit PGRMC1-mediated EGF receptor (EGFR) activation in cancer cells. Chemical screening using GL derivatives revealed that the glucoside derivative glucoglycyrrhizin (GlucoGL) binds more potently to PGRMC1 and contributes to the suppression of PGRMC1-mediated cancer chemoresistance. This study provides the first evidence of chemical compounds that directly bind to PGRMC1 to inhibit its function, and the findings provide new insights for cancer treatments that target PGRMC1. ABSTRACT: Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is highly expressed in various cancer cells and contributes to tumor progression. We have previously shown that PGRMC1 forms a unique heme-stacking functional dimer to enhance EGF receptor (EGFR) activity required for cancer proliferation and chemoresistance, and the dimer dissociates by carbon monoxide to attenuate its biological actions. Here, we determined that glycyrrhizin (GL), which is conventionally used to ameliorate inflammation, specifically binds to heme-dimerized PGRMC1. Binding analyses using isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that some GL derivatives, including its glucoside-derivative (GlucoGL), bind to PGRMC1 potently, whereas its aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), does not bind. GL and GlucoGL inhibit the interaction between PGRMC1 and EGFR, thereby suppressing EGFR-mediated signaling required for cancer progression. GL and GlucoGL significantly enhanced EGFR inhibitor erlotinib- or cisplatin (CDDP)-induced cell death in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. In addition, GL derivatives suppressed the intracellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by inhibiting the interaction between PGRMC1 and the LDL receptor (LDLR). Effects on other pathways cannot be excluded. Treatment with GlucoGL and CDDP significantly suppressed tumor growth following xenograft transplantation in mice. Collectively, this study indicates that GL derivatives are novel inhibitors of PGRMC1 that suppress cancer progression, and our findings provide new insights for cancer treatment.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rc-m3R

This study proposed a novel deep learning model that can diagnose COVID-19 on chest CT more accurately and swiftly. Based on traditional deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, we proposed three improvements: (i) We introduced stochastic pooling to replace average pooling and max pooling; (ii) We combined conv layer with batch normalization layer and obtained the conv block (CB); (iii) We combined dropout layer with fully connected layer and obtained the fully connected block (FCB). Our algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 93.28% ± 1.50%, a specificity of 94.00% ± 1.56%, and an accuracy of 93.64% ± 1.42%, in identifying COVID-19 from normal subjects. We proved using stochastic pooling yields better performance than average pooling and max pooling. We compared different structure configurations and proved our 3CB + 2FCB yields the best performance.

The 2009 H1N1 A influenza pandemic highlighted the importance of a swine host in the adaptation of influenza viruses to humans. Nowadays, one of the most extended strategies used to control swine influenza viruses (SIVs) is the trivalent vaccine application, whose formulation contains the most frequently circulating SIV subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These vaccines do not provide full protection against the virus, allowing its replication, evolution, and adaptation. To better understand the main mechanisms that shape viral evolution, here, the SIV intra-host diversity was analyzed in samples collected from both vaccinated and nonvaccinated animals challenged with the H1N1 influenza A virus. Twenty-eight whole SIV genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing, and differences in nucleotide variants between groups were established.

medical,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the barriers to effective pain management in Iranian people with cancer. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study was performed on 14 people with cancer. Data were collected using semi‐structured interviews and analysed by Graneheim and Lundman's content analysis method. RESULTS: Four main categories emerged in relation to barriers to pain management from the perspective of people with cancer. Categories included 1) accepting and enduring divine pain, 2) negative attitudes towards the effectiveness of analgesics, 3) patients’ low knowledge of pain self‐management methods and 4) neglected pain management. Barriers to pain management are multidimensional in nature consisting of patients, healthcare providers and system components. Therefore, attempts should be focused on the education of patients and healthcare providers about pain management and eliminating the shortcomings of the healthcare system.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9T4MUA

Everything was going fine until last 7 to 10 days my bowel movement has been strainful. Few days I have seen very small sized hard stools and sometimes small stool with very little water. I started taking Metamucil. However, the stomach felt bloated severely after eating anything. I sometimes feel a sudden hunger spike that becomes uncontrollable and once I eat, the stomach swells like a balloon. I also started taking one capsule of Triphala to ease out my symptoms. From past 4 to 5 days, I have started feeling fatigue and a very strong one like light handedness and no energy in my legs. I had a sore inside my mouth and that has healed significantly now. The acid reflux is there, especially while making out with my partner I felt food coming up. The consistency of stool after eating Metamucil has been more like rubber shaped long zig zag sausage with uneven and weird cracks and sometimes mucus as well. I feel gas below my stomach and sometimes have to strain hard to pass. I got my CBC done two days back (normal report), kidney, liver, thyroid (normal), Hb (normal), sugar (normal).

The best proposed healthcare model for telemedicine in hypertension management should include remote monitoring and transmission of vital signs (notably blood pressure) and medication adherence plus education on lifestyle and risk factors, with video consultation as an option. The use of mixed automated feedback services with supervision of a multidisciplinary clinical team (physician, nurse, or pharmacist) is the ideal approach.

medical,"PURPOSE Prone positioning, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has become increasingly utilised as an adjunct to increase oxygenation in critical care patients. It is associated with an adverse event profile. We sought to study the occurrence of ocular injuries reported in prone versus supine groups in adult critical care. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library were searched. The search period was 1st January 1990 - 1st July 2020. This review was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020196917. RESULTS Eleven RCTs were included, with 2,247 patients. Twenty-eight events were recorded in 3 trials (174 patients) and no events in the other 8 trials (2,073 patients). The incidence of eye injury was 1.30% (15 events / 1158 patients) and 1.19% (13 / 1089) in the prone and supine groups, reducing to 0.17% (2 / 1158) and 0.18% (2 / 1089) respectively when reports of eye or eyelid oedema were removed. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference between groups: with, odds ratio (OR) 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37, 5.27], and without, OR 0.78 [CI 0.11, 5.73], patients with reported oedema. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the rate of reported ocular injury between prone and supine critical care groups.

medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present a detailed agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with $R_0 = 2.45$, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model results, on average, in only around 23% of the resident population infected. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are much less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns appear very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low levels, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population immune. When vaccinating in midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ATXSz0
medical,"Helminths, including nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, are complex parasitic organisms that infect at least one billion people globally living in extreme poverty. Helminthic infections are associated with severe morbidity particularly in young children who often harbor the highest burden of disease. While each helminth species completes a distinct life cycle within the host, several helminths incite significant lung disease. This impact on the lungs occurs either directly from larval migration and host immune activation or indirectly from a systemic inflammatory immune response. The impact of helminths on the pulmonary immune response involves a sophisticated orchestration and activation of the host innate and adaptive immune cells. The consequences of activating pulmonary host immune responses are variable with several helminthic infections leading to severe, pulmonary compromise while others providing immune tolerance and protection against the development of pulmonary diseases. Further delineation of the convoluted interface between helminth infection and the pulmonary host immune responses is critical to the development of novel therapeutics that are critically needed to prevent the significant global morbidity caused by these parasites.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6cXG0Y

This study aimed to assess the well-being of Vietnamese people after COVID-19 lockdown measures were lifted and life gradually returned to normal. An online survey was organized from 21 to 25 April 2020 among Vietnamese residents aged 18 and over. The survey was launched by the Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index (scored 0-25) was used to score participants' well-being. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of well-being. A total of 1922 responses were analyzed (mean age: 31 years; 30.5% male; 88.2% health professionals or students in the health sector). The mean well-being score was 17.35 ± 4.97. Determinants of a high well-being score (&#8805;13) included older age, eating healthy food, practicing physical exercise, working from home, and adhering to the COVID-19 preventive measures. Female participants, persons worried about their relatives' health, and smokers were more likely to have a low well-being score. In conclusion, after the lockdown measures were lifted, the Vietnamese have people continued to follow COVID-19 preventive measures, and most of them scored high on the well-being scale.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: At the end of 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak spread around the globe with a late arrival to South America. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the long period of mandatory social isolation that took place in Argentina on the general psychological well-being of healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was conducted during June 2020, in healthcare workers. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue Test, and Goldberg depression and anxiety scale, were used to analyze the effects of the SARS-Cov 2 outbreak after three months of mandatory social isolation. Analyses were performed by logistic regression and a clustering algorithm in order to classify subjects in the function of their outcome's severity. RESULTS: From 1059 surveys, the majority reported symptoms of depression (81.0%), anxiety (76.5%), poor sleep quality (84.7%), and insomnia (73.7%) with 58.9% suffering from nightmares. Logistic regression showed that being in contact with COVID-19 patients, age, gender and the consumption of sleep medication during the mandatory social isolation were relevant predictors for insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Clustering analysis classified healthcare workers in three groups with healthy/mild, moderate, and severe outcomes. The most vulnerable group was composed mainly of younger people, female, non-medical staff, or physicians in training. CONCLUSION: An extremely high proportion of Argentinian healthcare workers suffered from sleep problems, anxiety, and depression symptoms.

medical,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 lead to the most challenging pandemic in this century, posing major economic and health challenges worldwide. Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SASR-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitates the development of novel broad-spectrum host-directed therapeutics. Here, employing genome-scale CRISPR screens, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. These screens identified known and novel host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, the host metabolic pathways pertaining to mitochondrial activity as well as phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis processes appeared to have major anti-viral functions. Comparative analysis between the different VOCs revealed the receptor KREMEN2 as unique gene required only to the Alpha variant, providing a possible explanation for the increased infectivity of this variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential pro-viral gene for all variants inspected. We reveal that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and is accordingly, critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed an elevated level of GATA6, indicating the important role GATA6 may be playing in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 results in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 represents a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ziiddW

medical,"Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials. Conclusions: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. Terms such as “camel exposure” and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), often associated with an array of infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases, is rarely seen with leptospirosis, which carries a relatively poor prognosis even with modern state-of-the-art medical care. We describe a patient with leptospirosis complicated by sHLH who succumbed to illness following multiorgan dysfunction. Case Description. A 74-year-old farmer presented with high-grade, unsettling fever for a week. Muddy water exposure and suggestive symptoms prompted investigation and management in the line of leptospirosis (IV ceftriaxone was instituted, and later, MAT (microscopic agglutination test) became positive). Subsequently, he developed severe acute hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Bone marrow biopsy and markedly elevated serum ferritin and triglyceride levels done on day 10 (with unresolving fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopaenia) confirmed the diagnosis of HLH. The routine cultures, retroviral studies, CMV, dengue, hanta and mycoplasma antibodies, tuberculosis and COVID-19 PCR, and malaria screening were all normal. There was no improvement of hypoxemia following intravenous methylprednisolone. He died on day 15 despite escalating organ support. CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease in the tropics with significant morbidity and mortality. In the case of severe leptospirosis, overlapping clinical features with sHLH make the diagnosis of the latter challenging. No assessment tools are available to date to predict the risk of developing sHLH in a patient having leptospirosis. Outcome following sHLH due to leptospirosis still remains majorly ominous. A high index of suspicion and low threshold for specific investigations could possibly alter the outcome following such an occurrence.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nlOLTj

Investigation of pattern in the occurrence of COVID-19, to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and prediction of incidence of COVID-19 are the objectives of this paper. METHODS: For trend analysis, Sen's Slope and Man-Kendall test have been used, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) of regression has been used to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence and to predict the frequency of COVID-19, and Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model has been used. RESULTS: Statistically significant linear trend found for the daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis indicates that there is some influence of the interaction of average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) on the incidence of COVID-19. However, this result is not consistent throughout the study area. The projections have been made up to 21st May, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Trend and regression analysis give an idea of the incidence of COVID-19 in India while projection made by Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model for the confirmed cases of the study area are encouraging as the sample prediction is as same as the actual number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uiGOXi

medical,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of under-five child deaths globally and in Bangladesh. Hypoxaemia or low (<90%) oxygen concentration in the arterial blood is one of the strongest predictors of child mortality from pneumonia and other acute respiratory infections. Since 2014, the World Health Organization recommends using pulse oximetry devices in Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) services (outpatient child health services), but it was not routinely used in most health facilities in Bangladesh until 2018. This paper describes the stakeholder engagement process embedded in an implementation research study to influence national policy and programmes to introduce pulse oximetry in routine IMCI services in Bangladesh. METHODS: Based on literature review and expert consultations, we developed a conceptual framework, which guided the planning and implementation of a 4-step stakeholder engagement process. Desk review, key informant interviews, consultative workshops and onsite demonstration were the key methods to involve and engage a wide range of stakeholders. In the first step, a comprehensive desk review and key informant interviews were conducted to identify stakeholder organisations and scored them based on their power and interest levels regarding IMCI implementation in Bangladesh. In the second step, two national level, two district level and five sub-district level sensitisation workshops were organised to orient all stakeholder organisations having high power or high interest regarding the importance of using pulse oximetry for pneumonia assessment and classification. In the third step, national and district level high power-high interest stakeholder organisations were involved in developing a joint action plan for introducing pulse oximetry in routine IMCI services. In the fourth step, led by a formal working group under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, we updated the national IMCI implementation package, including all guidelines, training manuals, services registers and referral forms in English and Bangla. Subsequently, we demonstrated its use in real-life settings involving various levels of (national, district and sub-district) stakeholders and worked alongside the government leaders towards carefully resuming activities despite the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our engagement process contributed to the national decision to introduce pulse oximetry in routine child health services and update the national IMCI implementation package demonstrating country ownership, government leadership and multi-partner involvement, which are steppingstones towards scalability and sustainability. However, our experience clearly delineates that stakeholder engagement is a context-driven, time-consuming, resource-intensive, iterative, mercurial process that demands meticulous planning, prioritisation, inclusiveness, and adaptability. It is also influenced by the expertise, experience and positionality of the facilitating organization. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience has demonstrated the value and potential of the approach that we adopted for stakeholder engagement. However, the approach needs to be conceptualised coupled with the allocation of adequate resources and time commitment to implement it effectively.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0K9beQ

medical,"The Indonesian government committed to restoring over 2 million ha of degraded peatland by the end of 2020, mainly to reduce peat fires and greenhouse gas emissions. Although it is unlikely the government will meet this target, restoration projects are still underway. One restoration strategy involves blocking peatland drainage canals, but the consequences of this for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture are unclear. This paper investigates perceived impacts of canal blocks on smallholder farmers and identifies factors that affect their willingness to accept canal blocks on their land. We use data from 181 household questionnaires collected in 2018 across three villages in Jambi province, Sumatra. We found that the majority of respondents would accept canal blocks on their farms, perceiving that the blocks would have no impact on yields or farm access, and would decrease fire risk. Respondents who would not accept blocks on their farms were more likely to use canals to access their farms and perceive that canal blocks would decrease yields. The majority of farmers unwilling to accept canal blocks did not change their mind when provided with an option of a block that would allow boat travel. Our results improve understanding of why some smallholders may be unwilling to engage with peatland restoration. Further research is needed to understand the impact of canal blocks on smallholders’ yields. Engaging with stakeholders from the outset to understand farmers’ concerns, and perceptions is key if the government is to succeed in meeting its peatland restoration target and to ensure that the costs and benefits of restoration are evenly shared between local stakeholders and other actors.

However, it is crucial to tackle the environmental impact of COVID-19 vaccine waste for sustainable vaccination management because a prolonged immunisation campaign is expected. As the pace of vaccine production, distribution and mass vaccination has been expedited, there is a simultaneous rise in plastic derived vaccine waste including syringes, needles, used/unused vaccine vials, vaccine packaging, and protective gear (surgical facemasks, gloves, face shields, etc). Henceforth, in view of the repercussions of heaping plastic waste in the environment, this article provides a perspective on the usage of synthetic and natural materials as potential substituents for vaccination tools. The biodegradable polymeric gums such as cellulose, gellan, pectin, etc. have been successfully applied for the fabrication of surgical facemasks. The highly suggestive practice is replacement of conventional polypropylene based plastics with bioplastics or paper for vaccine packaging. The usage of biodegradable bio-plastics as packaging material along with environmentally friendly face masks can help to achieve the zero waste approach. The discussion in the article significantly highlights the necessity of opting sustainable solutions of disinfecting and substituting vaccination tools for an environment friendly ongoing vaccination campaign.

medical,"The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of variety of diseases. Targeting the formation and action of angiotensin II (Ang II), the main RAS peptide, has been the key therapeutic target for last three decades. ACE-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2), a monocarboxypeptidase that had been discovered 20 years ago, is one of the catalytically most potent enzymes known to degrade Ang II to Ang-(1-7), a peptide that is increasingly accepted to have organ-protective properties that oppose and counterbalance those of Ang II. In addition to its role as a RAS enzyme ACE2 is the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss various strategies that have been used to achieve amplification of ACE2 activity including the potential therapeutic potential of soluble recombinant ACE2 protein and novel shorter ACE2 variants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vhIy_p

Based on empirical studies in Austria and Portugal, this paper investigates the motivations of students to participate in the movement and the solutions proposed by young activists to fight against climate emergency. Moreover, we discuss the integration of climate change activism into ESD (education for sustainable development) and transformative learning processes, and how this enables environmental citizenship. The results of the studies reveal that emotions and feelings of solidarity and collective aims are motives to participate in the strikes. The young activists sometimes propose innovative and sometimes radical solutions to climate emergency.

However, it is not entirely clear to what extent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of pet dogs and cats is in households. We have developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neutralization assay to screen serum samples of 239 pet cats and 510 pet dogs in Minnesota in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposures. A cutoff value was used to identify the seropositive samples in each experiment. The average seroprevalence of N- and RBD-specific antibodies in pet cats were 8% and 3%, respectively. Among nineteen (19) N-seropositive cat sera, fifteen (15) exhibited neutralizing activity and seven (7) were also RBD-seropositive. The N-based ELISA is also specific and does not cross react with antigens of common feline coronaviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at a very low percentage in pet dogs (~ 1%) and were limited to IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein with no neutralizing activities. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 seropositive rates are higher in pet cats than in pet dogs in MN early in the pandemic and that SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG antibodies can detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals with higher levels of specificity and sensitivity than RBD-specific IgG antibodies in ELISA-based assays.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cZ-Yy8
medical,"Several studies have found that black patients are more likely than white patients to test positive for or be hospitalized with COVID-19, but many of these same studies have found no difference in in-hospital mortality. These studies may have underestimated racial differences due to reliance on data from a single hospital system, as adequate control of patient-level characteristics requires aggregation of highly granular data from several institutions. Further, one factor thought to contribute to disparities in health outcomes by race is site of care. Several differences between black and white patient populations, such as access to care and referral patterns among clinicians, can lead to patients of different races largely attending different hospitals. We sought to develop a method that could study the potential association between attending hospital and racial disparity in mortality for COVID-19 patients without requiring patient-level data sharing among collaborating institutions. We propose a novel application of a distributed algorithm for generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) to perform counterfactual modeling and investigate the role of hospital in differences in COVID-19 mortality by race. Our counterfactual modeling approach uses simulation to randomly assign black patients to hospitals in the same distribution as those attended by white patients, quantifying the difference between observed mortality rates and simulated mortality risk following random hospital assignment. To illustrate our method, we perform a proof-of-concept analysis using data from four hospitals within the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. Our approach can be used by investigators from several institutions to study the impact of admitting hospital on COVID-19 mortality, a critical step in addressing systemic racism in modern healthcare.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",yW21_R

It commences with an explanation of the disruption to the five predicted future global megatrends - globalisation, urbanisation, digitisation, cybersecurity, sustainability - as a consequence of the global Covid-19 pandemic. The place of megatrends framing home economics is explored by presenting a textual analysis of a literacy publication created as an acceleration point for framing the next one hundred years of home economics and underpinned by global megatrends, published prior to the pandemic. Using the Voyant Tool, visualisations of the book Creating Home Economics Futures: The Next 100 Years are presented and compared to other key literary documents informing the field. The paper then turns to the ways in which education and learning have led to the repositioning of home economics as a field and home economics literacy as the key strategy for ensuring the field continues to remain relevant into the future.

medical,"Respiratory diseases including influenza A virus (IAV) infections represent a major threat to human health. While the development of a vaccine requires a lot of time, a fast countermeasure could be the use of defective interfering particles (DIPs) for antiviral therapy. IAV DIPs are usually characterized by a large internal deletion in one viral RNA segment. Consequentially, DIPs can only propagate in presence of infectious standard viruses (STVs), compensating the missing gene function. Here, they interfere with and suppress the STV replication and might act “universally” against many IAV subtypes. We recently reported a production system for purely clonal DIPs utilizing genetically modified cells. In the present study, we established an automated perfusion process for production of a DIP, called DI244, using an alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) system for cell retention. Viable cell concentrations and DIP titers more than 10-times higher than for a previously reported batch cultivation were observed. Further, we investigated a novel tubular cell retention device for its potential for continuous virus harvesting into the permeate. Very comparable performances to typically used hollow fiber membranes were found during the cell growth phase. During the virus replication phase the tubular membrane, in contrast to the hollow fiber membrane, allowed 100% of the produced virus particles to pass through. To our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous virus harvest was shown for a membrane-based perfusion process. Overall, the process established offers interesting possibilities for advanced process integration strategies for next-generation virus particle and virus vector manufacturing. Key points An automated perfusion process for production of IAV DIPs was established DIP titers of 7.40E+9 plaque forming units per mL were reached A novel tubular cell retention device enabled continuous virus harvesting",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",eqZILi

We first identify a set of regularity conditions on demand models and show that the state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. We next employ the dimensionality reduction approach to separate the scale factor that captures observed demand information from the optimal profit function, which yields a normalized dynamic program that is more tractable. We also analyze the effect of demand learning on the optimal policy using the system without Bayesian update as a benchmark.

medical,"COVID-19 in children accounts for up to 8% of all the cases and is less severe than in adults. This could be an underes-timation. A significant number of children are asymptomatic. Symptomatic infection is hard to distinguish from other respiratory tract viral infections based on symptoms and laboratory results. Anosmia is the only symptom in children that is highly suggestive of COVID-19. Infected children mostly have a positive household member. However, the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still controversial. Data suggest that schoolchildren have a greater impact in SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to younger children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a new entity reported since April 2020 and is considered a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It occurs in previously healthy older children and adolescents presenting with multisystem involvement and elevated inflammatory markers. Most children respond well to immune-modifying therapy. Treatment of COVID-19 in children is based solely on data received from adults and consists of supportive treatment and, in rare occasions, antiviral therapy (remdesivir), corticosteroids (dexamethasone) and monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab). Further studies in children are needed in order to better understand this disease.

medical,"The spreading of Coronavirus (covid-19) is pushing the healthcare organizations under exceptional over the universe and increasing pressure concurring to the World Health Organization (WHO). With advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the discovery of this type of infection during the initial stage will offers assistance in quick recuperation and in discharging the pressure on healthcare organizations. This paper presents the deep convolution network to detect the coronavirus in chest x-ray images. Due to the lack of benchmark datasets for covid-19 specifically in chest x-ray images, this work presents the framework that adopts the Generative Adversarial Network of Deep Convolution (DC-GAN). The proposed model of DC-GAN can generate a maximum of 30 different patterns for a single image and thus increases the size of dataset. It also offers assistance in overwhelming the overfitting issue and building the proposed framework more robust. The proposed model implements the transfer learning updated by the loss function using the ImageNet to attain the finest parameters from the pre-trained model. The publically available dataset is utilized to validate the proposed work. This work is validated by conducting the various experiments in various perspectives and also its performances are recorded using the measures namely accuracy, recall, precision and, F1score.

medical,"Considering that female sexual hormones may modulate the inflammatory response and also exhibit direct effects on the cells of the immune system, herein, we intend to discuss the sex differences and the role of estradiol in modulating the lung and systemic inflammatory response, focusing on its possible application as a treatment modality for SARS-CoV-2 patients. COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",SIccZj

Regarding the roles of government policies, the study finds that the ""stay-at-home"" measures implemented by states appeared to suppress labor demand. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) program helps to stabilize the advertised wages, but also suppresses labor demand.

A multidisciplinary international working group met on a videoconferencing platform in a multi-staged process to make consensus recommendations for adaptations to cleft protocols within resource-constrained settings. Feedback was sought from a roundtable discussion forum and global organizations involved in comprehensive cleft care. Foundational principles were agreed to enable recommendations to be globally relevant and two areas of focus within the specified topic were identified. First the safety aspects of cleft surgery protocols were scrutinized and COVID-19 adaptations, specifically in the pre- and perioperative periods, were highlighted. Second, surgical procedures and cleft care services were prioritized according to their relationship to functional outcomes and time-sensitivity. The surgical procedures assigned the highest priority were emergent interventions for breathing and nutritional requirements and primary palatoplasty. The cleft care services assigned the highest priority were new-born assessments, pediatric support for children with syndromes, management of acute dental or auditory infections and speech pathology intervention. A collaborative, interdisciplinary and international working group delivered consensus recommendations to assist with the provision of cleft care in low- and middle-income countries. At a time of global cleft care delays due to COVID-19, a united approach amongst global cleft care providers will be advantageous to advocate for children born with cleft lip and palate in resource-constrained settings.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nVtVSM

medical,"BACKGROUND: The internet has made significant contributions towards health education. Analyzing the pattern of online behavior regarding meningitis and vaccinations may be worthwhile. It is hypothesized that the online search patterns in meningitis are correlated with its number of cases and the search patterns of its related vaccines. METHODS: This was an infodemiological study that determined the relationship among online search interest in meningitis, its worldwide number of cases and its associated vaccines. Using Google Trends™ Search Volume Indices (SVIs), we evaluated the search queries “meningitis,” “pneumococcal vaccine,” “BCG vaccine,” “meningococcal vaccine” and “influenza vaccine” in January 2021, covering January 2008 to December 2020. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine correlations between these queries. RESULTS: The worldwide search interest in meningitis from 2008 to 2020 showed an average SVI of 46 ± 8.8. The most searched topics were symptoms, vaccines, and infectious agents with SVIs of 100, 52, and 39, respectively. The top three countries with the highest search interest were Ghana, Kazakhstan, and Kenya. There were weak, but statistically significant correlations between meningitis and the BCG (ρ = 0.369, p < 0.001) and meningococcal (ρ = 0.183, p < 0.05) vaccines. There were no statistically significant associations between the number of cases, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine. CONCLUSION: The relationships among the Google SVIs for meningitis and its related vaccines and number of cases data were inconsistent and remained unclear.

medical,"The immunogenicity of HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes in the S protein of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and of human coronavirus strain 229e (HCoV-229e) was analyzed for the elicitation of a T-cell immune response in donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection. We employed online database analysis to compare the differences in the amino acid sequences of the homologous T epitopes of HCoV-229e and SARS-CoV. The identified T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized, and their binding affinities for HLA-A2 were validated and compared in the T2 cell system. The immunogenicity of all these peptides was assessed by using T cells obtained from donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection and from healthy donors with no history of SARS-CoV infection. HLA-A2 typing by indirect immunofluorescent antibody staining showed that 51.6% of SARS-CoV-infected patients were HLA-A2 positive. Online database analysis and the T2 cell binding test disclosed that the number of HLA-A2-restricted immunogenic epitopes of the S protein of SARS-CoV was decreased or even lost in comparison with the homologous sequences of the S protein of HCoV-229e. Among the peptides used in the study, the affinity of peptides from HCoV-229e (H77 and H881) and peptides from SARS-CoV (S978 and S1203) for binding to HLA-A2 was higher than that of other sequences. The gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release Elispot assay revealed that only SARS-CoV-specific peptides S1203 and S978 induced a high frequency of IFN-gamma-secreting T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection; such a T-cell epitope-specific response was not observed in HLA-A2(+) healthy donors or in HLA-A2(-) donors who had been infected with SARS-CoV after full recovery. Thus, T-cell epitopes S1203 and S978 are immunogenic and elicit an overt specific T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) SARS-CoV-infected patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4JwA3o

medical,"This study uses protection motivation theory (PMT) to examine the quitting intentions and behaviours of smokers who have varying levels of nicotine dependence. Our goals are to identify the psychological factors that influence smoking cessation and to provide valuable evidence to promote theory-guided interventions. This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted from July to August 2020. Participants were randomly selected on the streets of 26 provinces on mainland China. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Our analysis was conducted in three steps. First, we employed descriptive statistics to present the overall characteristics of our sample. Second, we analysed the association between PMT constructs and quitting intentions stratified by nicotine dependence. Third, we tested how quitting intentions were associated with quitting behaviours in each subgroup using logistic regression models. For intention, almost all the PMT constructs were significantly associated with quitting intention in the low-dependence group. For the moderate- and high-dependence groups, only perceived vulnerability (coefficient = 0.35, P = 0.04) was positively associated with quitting intention. For behaviour, we found a stronger association between quitting intention and behaviour in the low-dependence group (Coef. = 1.67, P = 0.00) than for the other groups. We found a significant association between e-cigarette use and quitting behaviour only in the low-dependence group (Coef. = 1.34, P = 0.00). Coefficients for the moderate- and high-dependence groups were not statistically significant. Smokers at various levels of nicotine dependence have different psychological factors that influence their intentions to stop smoking. Quitting intention was more significantly associated with quitting behaviour for the low nicotine-dependence group than for the other groups. More convincing research is necessary to determine how e-cigarette use affects quitting behaviour in the long term.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EULgeA

Hypobaic hypoxia (HH) and cold are conditions characteristic of high altitude environment. HH is always considered as the central causative factor for the development of HACE, but the effect of cold stress on HACE has been rarely investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of cold stress in the development of HACE and establish a stable experimental animal model. Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 ℃), NC + 2 ℃ group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 ℃), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 ℃), HH+2 ℃ group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 ℃) and HH + 12/2 ℃ (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 ℃/2 ℃ light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2 ℃ could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 ℃. Furthermore, HH+2 ℃ and HH + 12/2 ℃ markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2 ℃ and HH + 12/2 ℃ enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2 ℃ could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 ℃groups. These results demonstrated that HH or cold stress alone did not successfully induce brain damage, while HH+2 ℃ could induce the onset of HACE via provoking injury caused by HH. HH + 12/2 ℃ was more obvious and efficient. Collectively, we firstly suggest that cold stress may promote the formation of HACE by aggravating the brain injury induced by HH exposure and supply an effective and reliable experimental rat model of HACE via HH combined with temperature fluctuation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",3pfyJH

The application of a data-driven technique has allowed to identify a statistically reliable model through which the functional relationships between the variables considered and the selling prices in the current state have been detected, and the new market values generated by the redevelopment project have been then determined, in order to compare them with those relating to the current state. The results obtained point out an increase in the values of the sample properties as a result of the redevelopment project, confirming the empirically expected outputs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ViTPz-
medical,"BACKGROUNDCOVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been considered a treatment option for COVID-19. This trial assessed the efficacy of a neutralizing antibody containing high-dose CCP in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support or intensive care treatment.METHODSPatients (n = 105) were randomized 1:1 to either receive standard treatment and 3 units of CCP or standard treatment alone. Control group patients with progress on day 14 could cross over to the CCP group. The primary outcome was a dichotomous composite outcome of survival and no longer fulfilling criteria for severe COVID-19 on day 21.ResultsThe primary outcome occurred in 43.4% of patients in the CCP group and 32.7% in the control group (P = 0.32). The median time to clinical improvement was 26 days in the CCP group and 66 days in the control group (P = 0.27). The median time to discharge from the hospital was 31 days in the CCP group and 51 days in the control group (P = 0.24). In the subgroup that received a higher cumulative amount of neutralizing antibodies, the primary outcome occurred in 56.0% of the patients (vs. 32.1%), with significantly shorter intervals to clinical improvement (20 vs. 66 days, P < 0.05) and to hospital discharge (21 vs. 51 days, P = 0.03) and better survival (day-60 probability of survival 91.6% vs. 68.1%, P = 0.02) in comparison with the control group.ConclusionCCP added to standard treatment was not associated with a significant improvement in the primary and secondary outcomes. A predefined subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit of CCP among patients who received a larger amount of neutralizing antibodies.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04433910.FundingBundesministerium für Gesundheit (German Federal Ministry of Health): ZMVI1-2520COR802.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9ZEorM

medical,"We sought to evaluate the adherence of Vietnamese adults to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) preventive measures, and gain insight into the effects of the epidemic on the daily lives of Vietnamese people. An online questionnaire was administered from March 31 to April 6, 2020. The questionnaire assessed personal preventive behavior (such as physical distancing, wearing a face mask, cough etiquette, regular handwashing and using an alcohol hand sanitizer, body temperature check, and disinfecting mobile phones) and community preventive behavior (such as avoiding meetings, large gatherings, going to the market, avoiding travel in a vehicle/bus with more than 10 persons, and not traveling outside of the local area during the lockdown). A total adherence score was calculated by summing the scores of the 9 personal and the 11 community prevention questions. In total, 2175 respondents completed the questionnaire; mean age: 31.4 ± 10.7; (range: 18–69); 66.9% were women; 54.2% were health professionals and 22.8% were medical students. The mean adherence scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 ± 1.63 (range 1–9) and 9.57 ± 1.12 (range 1–11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown (Beta (β) = 2.64, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.25–4.03), fears/worries concerning one’s health (β = 2.87, 95% CI 0.04–5.70), residing in large cities (β = 19.40, 95% CI 13.78–25.03), access to official COVID-19 information sources (β = 16.45, 95% CI 6.82–26.08), and working in healthcare/medical students (β = 22.53, 95% CI 16.00–29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti-COVID instructions.

medical,"A recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) protein is attenuated in vivo. Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship. Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation. Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence. Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced inflammation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",yRO156

medical,"BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is defined as the abnormal accumulation of interstitial fluid and fibro-adipose tissues resulting from injury, infection, or congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system. The gold standard approach in the treatment of lymphedema is Complete Decongestive Therapy and it has many components that require practical knowledge and skills. YouTube can be a useful tool to provide these skills to healthcare professionals and patients. The aim of this study was to examine the videos about lymphedema rehabilitation on YouTube and analyze their technical features, sources, contents, educational value and reliability. METHODS: The YouTube database was searched using the “lymphedema rehabilitation”, “lymphedema treatment”, “complete decongestive therapy”, “lymphedema massage”, and “lymphedema exercises” keywords. Two reviewers (Physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist) assessed videos for educational quality using a Global Quality Scale (GQS). To evaluate the reliability the 5-point Discern scale was used. RESULTS: A total of 90 videos, which met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. The mean duration of the videos was 8.9 ± 10.5 min. The mean number of daily views was 22.7 ± 47.1 for a day. The majority of the videos were created to inform patients (57.8%).The uploaders were mostly private healthcare institutions or healthcare professionals (65.6%). Information providers were lymphedema therapists mostly (63.3%). Manual lymphatic drainage was observed to stand out as the most mentioned lymphedema rehabilitation component on YouTube. The mean of reliability and GQS scores of the videos were 2.2 ± 1.0 and 2.7 ± 1.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The biggest obstacle for YouTube to be an excellent source of information is that it hosts large volumes of uncontrolled and low-quality data. When Youtube content related to lymphedema rehabilitation was examined, it was observed that many videos were quite insufficient and incomplete even though there were useful videos. If careful controlling measures are implemented and if medical videos aim to meet reliability and GQS criteria, YouTube can become an effective and useful source of information for lymphedema rehabilitation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tuR-rk

medical,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization classified coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as a pandemic and recommends strict restrictions regarding most aspects of daily activities. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the pandemic has changed the prenatal care and pregnancy outcome in pregnant women without COVID-19. METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to describe changes in outpatient clinic visits and to compare the rates of cesarean and instrumental deliveries between two periods of time: March-April 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) with March-April of the preceding year, 2019. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, visits to obstetric triage, gynecologic triage, high-risk clinic, and ultrasound units decreased by 36.4%, 34.7%, 32.8%, and 18.1%, respectively. The medical center experienced a 17.8% drop in the total number of births (610 births) compared with March and April 2019 (742 births). During the outbreak women were more likely to be nulliparous (33.3% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.02) and present with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (7.5% vs. 4%, P = 0.005) or gestational diabetes (13% vs. 10%, P = 0.03). More epidural analgesia was used (83.1% vs. 77.1%, P = 0.006). There were more operative vaginal deliveries during the outbreak (16.7% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.01). All other maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: The medical facility experienced a major decline in all aspects of the routine obstetrics activities during the time of the pandemic. The higher rate of operative vaginal deliveries among nulliparous may be associated with the pandemic effect on the rate of high-risk patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zyJyF0

medical,"The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causal agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has diverged due to multiple mutations since its emergence as a human pathogen in December 2019. Some mutations have defined several SARS-CoV-2 clades that seem to behave differently in terms of regional distribution and other biological features. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are used to classify the sequence variants in viruses from individual human patients. However, the cost and relative scarcity of NGS equipment and expertise in developing countries prevent studies aimed to associate specific clades and variants to clinical features and outcomes in such territories. As of March 2021, the GR clade and its derivatives, including the B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28 variants, predominate worldwide. We implemented the post-PCR small-amplicon high-resolution melting analysis to genotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from the saliva of individual patients. This procedure was able to clearly distinguish two groups of samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples predicted, according to their melting profiles, to contain GR and non-GR viruses. This grouping of the samples was validated by means of amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) assay as well as Sanger sequencing.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",a2ihOT
medical,"Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a constant worldwide threat to human health. Although conventional vaccines are available, their protective efficacy is type or strain specific, and their production is time-consuming. For the control of an influenza pandemic in particular, agents that are immediately effective against a wide range of virus variants should be developed. Although pretreatment of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have already been reported to be effective in the defense against subsequent IAV infection, the efficacy was limited to specific subtypes, and safety concerns were also raised. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of an attenuated bacterial outer membrane vesicle -harboring modified lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (fmOMV) against IAV infection and the underlying mechanisms. Administration of fmOMV conferred significant protection against a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, PR8, H5N2, and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses; this broad antiviral activity was dependent on macrophages but independent of neutrophils. fmOMV induced recruitment and activation of macrophages and elicited type I IFNs. Intriguingly, fmOMV showed a more significant protective effect than other TLR ligands tested in previous reports, without exhibiting any adverse effect. These results show the potential of fmOMV as a prophylactic agent for the defense against influenza virus infection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jNYNDc

medical,"PURPOSE: During the late autumn to winter season (October to December) in the Republic of Korea, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Interestingly, in 2014, human coronavirus (HCoV) caused not only upper respiratory infections but also LRTIs more commonly than in other years. Therefore, we sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and severity of illnesses associated with HCoV infections at a single center in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV respiratory specimens between October 2014 and December 2014 who were admitted to Severance Children’s Hospital at Yonsei University Medical Center for LRTI. Charts of the patients with HCoV infection were reviewed and compared with RSV infection. RESULTS: During the study period, HCoV was the third most common respiratory virus and accounted for 13.7% of infections. Coinfection was detected in 43.8% of children with HCoV. Interestingly, one patient had both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. Mild pneumonia was most common (60.4%) with HCoV, and when combined with RSV, resulted in bronchiolitis. Two patients required care in the intensive care unit. However, compared with that of RSV infection, the disease course HCoV was short. CONCLUSION: Infections caused by HCoVs are common, and can cause LRTIs. During an epidemic season, clinicians should be given special consideration thereto. When combined with other medical conditions, such as neurologic or cardiologic diseases, intensive care unit (ICU) care may be necessary.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",QAz7FM
medical,"Objectives: To evaluate the association between a known history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 diabetic patients. Methods: This prospective cohort study categorized COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a secondary care hospital in South India into DM patients and Non-DM patients. Data regarding the past medical and medication history was collected on the day of admission and the patients were regularly followed up till discharge or death. The outcome measures including duration of hospital stay, mortality, need for ICU care/mechanical ventilation were compared between the two groups. Data is extracted and statistically analyzed using Pearson correlation. Results: Out of a total of 118 patients observed, 53 patients were diabetic and 65 were non-diabetic. Out of the 53 hyperglycemic patients, 39 patients were on metformin therapy while 15 patients were on insulin before admission due to COVID-19. A higher mortality rate was observed in the DM group when compared with the Non-DM group [26.4% (14) vs 9.23% (6)]. An increased random blood glucose levels at the time of admission had a positive correlation with mortality (p = 0.003). While insulin administration prior to admission had negative correlation with mortality [R value is -0.282 (p = 0.02)], increased insulin requirement during hospitalization is associated with poor outcomes [R value is 0.327 (p = 0.002)]. Conclusions: People with diabetes when infected with COVID-19 are at a greater risk of morbidity and mortality.

medical,"BACKGROUND The IMS III trial did not show a clinical benefit of endovascular treatment compared with intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) alone for moderate or severe ischaemic strokes. Late reperfusion of tissue that was no longer salvageable could be one explanation, as suggested by previous exploratory studies that showed an association between time to reperfusion and good clinical outcome. We sought to validate this association in a preplanned analysis of data from the IMS III trial. METHODS We used data for patients with complete proximal arterial occlusions in the anterior circulation who received endovascular treatment and achieved angiographic reperfusion (score on Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale of grade 2-3) during the endovascular procedure (within 7 h of symptom onset). We used logistic regression to model good clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months) as a function of the time to reperfusion. We prespecified variables to be considered for adjustment, including age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, sex, and baseline blood glucose concentration. FINDINGS Of 240 patients who were otherwise eligible for inclusion in our analysis, 182 (76%) achieved angiographic reperfusion. Mean time from symptom onset to reperfusion (ie, procedure end) was 325 min (SD 52). Increased time to reperfusion was associated with a decreased likelihood of good clinical outcome (unadjusted relative risk for every 30-min delay 0·85 [95% CI 0·77-0·94]; adjusted relative risk 0·88 [0·80-0·98]). INTERPRETATION Delays in time to angiographic reperfusion lead to a decreased likelihood of good clinical outcome in patients after moderate to severe stroke. Rapid reperfusion could be crucial for the success of future acute endovascular trials.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) are at high risk for contracting infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease that can lead to severe pneumonia and ARDS with potentially fatal outcome. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze risk factors, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in patients after alloSCT. STUDY DESIGN: Patients after alloSCT who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 at German and Austrian transplant centers between February 2020 and July 2021 were included in our retrospective study on behalf of the German Cooperative Transplant Study Group. Classification of COVID-19 severity into mild, moderate-severe and critical disease and the division of the course of the pandemic into 4 phases were performed according to the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Main endpoint was overall mortality at the end of follow up. We further analyzed need for treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU) and severity of disease. Risk factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis, survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 130 patients from 14 transplant centers with a median age at diagnosis of COVID-19 of 59 (20-81) years and a median time between alloSCT and COVID-19 of 787 (19-8138) days were included. The most common underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (45.4 %) and lymphoma (10.8 %). The majority of patients (84.9 %) were infected in the later phases of the pandemic. 20.8 % developed moderate-severe and 12.3 % critical disease, 19.2 % were treated on an ICU. After a median follow up of 127 days overall mortality was 16.2 %, among patients on ICU 52.0 %. Risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were active disease (OR 4.46), infection with SARS-CoV-2 ≤ 365 days after alloSCT (OR 5.60), age > 60 years (OR 5.39) and ongoing immunosuppression with cyclosporine (OR 8.55); risk factors for developing moderate-severe or critical disease were concurrent immunosuppression (OR 4.06) and age > 40 years (OR 4.08). CONCLUSION: Patients after alloSCT exhibit a substantially increased mortality risk after COVID-19 infection compared to the normal population, without considerable improvement over the course of the pandemic. Risk factors include age, early infection post alloSCT and active immunosuppression.

medical,"Modern view of network resilience and epidemic spreading has been shaped by percolation tools from statistical physics, where nodes and edges are removed or immunized randomly from a large-scale network. In this paper, we produce a theoretical framework for studying targeted immunization in networks, where only n nodes can be observed at a time with the most connected one among them being immunized and the immunity it has acquired may be lost subject to a decay probability ρ. We examine analytically the percolation properties as well as scaling laws, which uncover distinctive characters for Erdős-Rényi and power-law networks in the two dimensions of n and ρ. We study both the case of a fixed immunity loss rate as well as an asymptotic total loss scenario, paving the way to further understand temporary immunity in complex percolation processes with limited knowledge.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oV89n5

medical,"Objetivos A pandemia causada pelo COVID-19 tem sido um desafio para diferentes serviços incluindo o banco de sangue (BS), impactando negativamente e forçando, governos e agências regulatórias a desenvolverem protocolos para garantir a segurança do doador e estratégias para suprir a necessidade de hemocomponentes. O objetivo deste trabalho foi descrever as ações adotadas e os resultados alcançados com incremento da segurança e atender as necessidades transfusionais durante a pandemia. Materiais e métodos Os principais métodos utilizados pela equipe de captação para convocar foram aplicativo WhatsApp Messenger para organizadores de grupos, e contato telefônico com o paciente e seus familiares através de abordagem direta e apresentação dos cuidados para evitar a contaminação por COVID-19. Diversas modificações foram implementadas para impedir a aglomeração e diminuir o tempo de permanência dos doadores: agendamento de doação e de pequenos grupos no máximo 10 pessoas, entrega de senhas, transporte dedicado, internalização do lanche no BS, pré-triagem, não convocar grupos de risco relacionados a COVID-19 e acessar por QR code material informativo, recomendações pós doação, pesquisa de satisfação e carteirinha. Os testes qui-quadrado ou fisher's foram utilizados para comparar as proporções e um valor de p menor que 0,05 foi considerado significativo. Resultados Ao analisar os dados pré-pandemia (Julho a Dezembro 2018 e 2019) e durante a pandemia (2020 e Janeiro a Junho de 2021) observamos que a necessidade de transfusão cresceu 11,62% de 15506 para 17308 (p < 0,0001). As ações adotadas resultaram em aumento de 25,16% (p < 0,0001) no total de doadores (10769 vs 8604), gerando maior número de bolsas coletadas (10733 vs 8544) com p < 0,0001. Com redução da coleta externa (p < 0,001), foram 50 bolsas coletadas em 2020 e nenhuma em 2021, contra 1015 bolsas coletadas no pré-pandemia e de bolsas solicitadas de terceiros com p < 0,001 (81 vs 22). O tipo de doador foi alterado durante a pandemia, com significância estatística p < 0,001: aumento dos novos para sangue (4003 vs 5396) e aférese (16 vs 53), aumento nos de repetição para aférese (1892 vs 2818) e redução dos doadores de repetição (1893 vs 1750) e esporádico (747 vs 628) para sangue. Em relação ao gênero, com significância estatística p<0,001: nos doadores de sangue houve aumento em ambos, masculino (3898 vs 4485) e feminino (1948 vs 3289). Na aférese houve aumento dos doadores masculino (1625 vs 2670). A faixa etária predominante nos 02 períodos analisados para doadores de sangue foi 18-29 anos e para aférese 30-39, indicando que a pandemia não interferiu na idade. Discussão Ao considerar a insegurança dos doadores de serem infectados pela COVID-19 as ações aplicadas conseguiram suprir a demanda aumentada. Essas ações associadas as estratégias da equipe de captação e a afirmação e divulgação dos doadores de que o nosso serviço é um lugar a ser frequentado está refletido no aumento no total de doadores durante a pandemia. Conclusão As ações desenvolvidas foram capazes de atender o aumento da demanda transfusional mantendo os estoques sem necessidade de coleta externa e redução de bolsas solicitadas, mesmo durante a pandemia.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9TbyBA

medical,"OBJECTIVES: Antigen tests have emerged as an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR, thought to be valuable especially for the screening of bigger communities. To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons. METHODS: We examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms. RESULTS: While PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95%CI 0.599, 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95%CI 0.558, 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95%CI 0.667, 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95%CI 0.611, 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95%CI 0.067, 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above >30. CONCLUSIONS: Low sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool, and to follow with PCR if it is applied to vulnerable populations.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fts-jU

To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS‐CoV‐2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS‐CoV‐2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5‐related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4‐related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 93,000 Americans lost their lives to a preventable overdose. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) have been shown to decrease mortality in OUD but are underutilized. Through this case-based learning exercise, first-year medical students applied physiologic and pharmacologic principles to the diagnosis and treatment of OUD. METHODS: Faculty facilitated a case discussion over a 1-hour large-group case-based learning (CBL) session. Facilitators utilized PowerPoint slides to illustrate graphs and figures while discussing the case. To evaluate students on the CBL learning objectives, three pharmacology exam questions were administered; students also evaluated the CBL's effectiveness in meeting educational objectives on three Likert-scale questions and via open-ended feedback. RESULTS: First-year medical students (n = 200) completed the CBL. The mean score on the exam questions was 91%. Students agreed or strongly agreed that the CBL was an effective way to learn pharmacology principles (69%), that it reinforced pharmacologic fundamentals (70%), and that it showed how pharmacology fundamentals were important in the real world of clinical medicine (86%). Qualitative feedback on the CBL was generally positive, including satisfaction with the small-group setting and practical applications of pharmacology to clinical practice. DISCUSSION: This CBL exercise contains content critical for preparing students to combat the modern opioid epidemic. The exercise provides an opportunity for learners to review fundamental pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic principles so as to ready them for clinical clerkships and beyond.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tzhqc1

medical,"BACKGROUND Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for rectal tumors has been introduced as an alternative approach to transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). TEM has some limitations, such as the need for special equipment, expensive cost, and steep learning curve. In this study, we address the technical feasibility of TAMIS under spinal anesthesia and its short-term postoperative outcomes. METHODS From July 2011 to September 2012, 25 consecutive patients with middle or upper third rectal masses underwent TAMIS. Tumors were located 6-17 cm from the anal verge. After spinal anesthesia, a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port was inserted into the anal canal. With this access, conventional laparoscopic instruments, including a grasper and monopolar electrocautery and suction device, were used to perform the transanal excision. A hook-type monopolar electrocautery or harmonic scalpel was used for dissection. The defect of the rectum was closed by interrupted sutures. Data concerning demographics, details of operative procedure, postoperative pain, and pathologic results were collected prospectively. To evaluate anal sphincter injury, an endoanal ultrasonography and fecal incontinence severity index survey were performed at 3-6 months after the operation. RESULTS Of the 25 patients, nine had adenocarcinomas, nine had neuroendocrine tumors, three had tubular adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, three had tubular adenomas, one had a tubulovillous adenoma, and one had a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The median distance from the tumor mass to the anal verge was 9.0 (range 6-17) cm. The median operative time was 45.0 (range 20-120) min. All patients received TAMIS without conversion to laparoscopic resection. There were no intraoperative complications or postoperative morbidity. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3.0 (range 2-7) days. No sphincter injury was detected by endoanal ultrasonography. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS under spinal anesthesia is a safe and feasible technique for resection of middle and upper rectal masses.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation. METHODS: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The “Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention” (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W ≥ 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants. DISCUSSION: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.

About five months ago, I started doing more things again, mainly little things like going out to hang out with my horses, and going to a therapist for a bit. Then around two or three months ago, I decided to go to a fitness trainer to get myself even more fit for my horse riding. I have been held back quite a bit by an issue, what tends to happen is normally when I do something strenuous (but it also happens when temperature switches or the air just becomes more humid) I will start feeling my heart rate become quite rapid and heavy feeling, then I feel dizzy (my head feels really weird) and I will quite quickly feel sick and have to throw up or at least dry-retch. The doctor thought it might be something to do with my thyroid glands so took a full blood test, everything looked normal, my trainer thought it might be anxiety but it has happened at times where I am at my calmest, and my parents thought it might be because I am unfit, but after doing training and my fitness is pretty much back up to where it was before my break, it is still happening and has not improved at all.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Families of the mental health care users (MHCUs) face different challenges in dealing with, supporting and caring for MHCUs on a daily basis. The divergent coping mechanisms that the family members use aim to lower the negative, psychological and emotional impact of the stress. These include: escape, avoidance and denial. AIM: To explore, describe and contextualise coping mechanisms used by the families of MHCUs and to suggest recommendations for improving their coping mechanisms in Mahikeng sub-district, North West province (NWP), South Africa. SETTING: The study was conducted in three community health centres in Mahikeng sub-district, NWP, South Africa. METHODS: A qualitative-exploratory-descriptive and contextual research design was used. Non-probability convenience and purposive sampling techniques were used to select participants. WhatsApp video calls were used to collect data which were analysed following Creswell’s six steps of qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: The study established three themes namely; challenges experienced by the family members, coping mechanism used by the family members, and suggestions for improvement in the coping mechanisms for the family members. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the family members of MHCUs are faced with different challenges. Some of the coping mechanisms used by the family members are insufficient and require improvement to enable them to cope effectively. When the coping mechanisms of the family members of MHCUs are improved, their well-being and that of the MHCUs might improve significantly. CONTRIBUTION: The findings of this study provides information that may be used to improve the coping mechanisms of the families of MHCUs in the NWP, South Africa.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HNOXWA

medical,"Tuberculosis (TB) is still the number one cause of death due to an infectious disease. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs are key in the optimization of TB treatment and help to prevent slow response to treatment, acquired drug resistance, and adverse drug effects. The aim of this review was to provide an update on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs and to show how population pharmacokinetics and Bayesian dose adjustment can be used to optimize treatment. We cover aspects on preclinical, clinical, and population pharmacokinetics of different drugs used for drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB. Moreover, we include available data to support therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs and known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets that can be used for optimization of therapy. We have identified a wide range of population pharmacokinetic models for first- and second-line drugs used for TB, which included models built on NONMEM, Pmetrics, ADAPT, MWPharm, Monolix, Phoenix, and NPEM2 software. The first population models were built for isoniazid and rifampicin; however, in recent years, more data have emerged for both new anti-TB drugs, but also for defining targets of older anti-TB drugs. Since the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring for TB over 3 decades ago, further development of therapeutic drug monitoring in TB next steps will again depend on academic and clinical initiatives. We recommend close collaboration between researchers and the World Health Organization to provide important guideline updates regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LzCqom

One of the most studied and used as a paradigmatic case is the population collapse of the Rapa Nui society. Here, we test different hypotheses about it by developing explicit population dynamic models that integrate feedbacks between climatic, demographic and ecological factors that underpinned the socio-cultural trajectory of these people. We evaluate our model outputs against a reconstruction of past population size based on archaeological radiocarbon dates from the island. The resulting estimated demographic declines of the Rapa Nui people are linked to the long-term effects of climate change on the island's carrying capacity and, in turn, on the 'per-capita food supply'.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",22zFOS

A security consideration is a major aspect in any cloud data storage model to provide safety and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a secure data protection model over the cloud. The proposed model presents a solution to some security issues of cloud such as data protection from any violations and protection from a fake authorized identity user, which adversely affects the security of the cloud. This paper includes multiple issues and challenges with cloud computing that impairs security and privacy of data. It presents the threats and attacks that affect data residing in the cloud. Our proposed model provides the benefits and effectiveness of security in cloud computing such as enhancement of the encryption of data in the cloud. It provides security and scalability of data sharing for users on the cloud computing. Our model achieves the security functions over cloud computing such as identification and authentication, authorization, and encryption. Also, this model protects the system from any fake data owner who enters malicious information that may destroy the main goal of cloud services. We develop the one-time password (OTP) as a logging technique and uploading technique to protect users and data owners from any fake unauthorized access to the cloud. We implement our model using a simulation of the model called Next Generation Secure Cloud Server (NG-Cloud). These results increase the security protection techniques for end user and data owner from fake user and fake data owner in the cloud.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",bh43AH

medical,"INTRODUCTION Death due to opioid overdose was declared a public health crisis in Canada in 2015. Traditionally, patients who have overdosed on opioids that are managed by emergency medical services (EMS) are treated with the opioid antagonist naloxone, provided ventilatory support and subsequently transported to hospital. However, certain EMS agencies have permitted patients who have been reversed from opioid overdose to refuse transport, if the patient exhibits capacity to do so. Evidence on the safety of this practice is limited. Therefore, our intent was to examine the available literature to determine mortality and serious adverse events within 48 hours of EMS treat and release due to suspected rebound opioid toxicity after naloxone administration. METHODS A systematic search was performed on 11 May 2017 in PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase and CINHAL. Studies that reported on the outcome of patients treated with prehospital naloxone and released at the scene were included. Analyses for incidence of mortality and adverse events at the scene were conducted. Risk of bias and assessment of publication bias was also done. RESULTS 1401 records were screened after duplicate removal. Eighteen full-text studies were reviewed with seven selected for inclusion. None were found to be high risk of bias. In most studies, heroin was the source of the overdose. Mortality within 48 hours was infrequent with only four deaths among 4912 patients ﴾0.081%﴿ in the seven studies. Only one study reported on adverse events and found no incidence of adverse events from their sample of 71 released patients. CONCLUSION Mortality or serious adverse events due to suspected rebound toxicity in patients released on scene post-EMS treatment with naloxone were rare. However, studies involving longer-acting opioids were rare and no study involved fentanyl.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5O-AtZ

medical,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced our daily and social lives as well as our consumption patterns. This paper focuses on the relationship between the COVID-19 threat and variety-seeking. Based on several theories, including reactance theory and terror management theory, we predict that the perceived threat of COVID-19 will increase the tendency to choose more and different options in multiple choice settings. Firstly, two empirical studies demonstrate that variety-seeking in food and stationery choices is enhanced as people's perceived threat from the disease increases. Study 3 further suggests the boundary conditions of the above pattern in that the type of decision (i.e., multiple option selections across different brands vs. within the same brand) will moderate the impact of the perceived threat on varietyseeking. Specifically, when the decision involved choice across different brands, participants showed higher variety-seeking under high (vs. low) perceived threat. However, the opposite pattern was true when the decision involved choice within the same brand. This research offers a deeper understanding of how variety-seeking can be changed by the perceived threat of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",a3xAp2

medical,"BACKGROUND: High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a high versus low-added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). All results were judged as low-quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. Future trials should have longer follow-up time and report on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Ta3i6C

medical,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal variation has been observed for various bacterial and viral infections. We aimed to further study seasonality of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens in relation to antibiotic use, as well as meteorological parameters. METHODS: An ecologic study of antibiotic exposure, meteorological parameters, detection of respiratory viruses and clinical isolates of Clostridioides difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (grouped together as gram-negative bacteria; GNB) in Rhode Island from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: Peak detection of C. difficile occurred 3 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.07–1.43; P = 0.006). Peak MRSA detection was noted 7 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.21–2.35; P = 0.003) and 10 months after the peak in respiratory virus detection (OR = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01–1.06; P = 0.003). Peak GNB detection was noted 2 months after the peak mean monthly ambient temperature (OR = 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.20–2.39; P = 0.004). Peak detection of S. pneumoniae was noted at the same time as the peak in detection of respiratory viruses (OR = 1.01, 95% C.I., 1.00–1.01; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct seasonal variation in detection of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. C. difficile seasonality may, in part, be related to antibiotic prescriptions filled; GNB seasonality may be related to ambient temperature and S. pneumoniae may be related to concurrent respiratory viral infections.

medical,"This article outlines a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach to treating feelings of guilt and aims to be a practical 'how to' guide for therapists. The therapeutic techniques were developed in the context of working with clients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);however, the ideas can also be used when working with clients who do not meet a diagnosis of PTSD but have experienced trauma or adversity and feel guilty. The techniques in this article are therefore widely applicable: to veterans, refugees, survivors of abuse, the bereaved, and healthcare professionals affected by COVID-19, amongst others. We consider how to assess and formulate feelings of guilt and suggest multiple cognitive and imagery strategies which can be used to reduce feelings of guilt. When working with clients with a diagnosis of PTSD, it is important to establish whether the guilt was first experienced during the traumatic event (peri-traumatically) or after the traumatic event (post-traumatically). If the guilt is peri-traumatic, following cognitive work, this new information may then need to be integrated into the traumatic memory during reliving.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: Nursing homes have suffered in a particularly pronounced way from the effects of COVID-19 so it is very convenient to know the evolution in them of the disease and the impact of SARS-CoV2 vaccination The objective of this study was to analyze COVID-19 pandemic evolution from the start of the second wave to the end of the vaccination campaign at the nursing homes. A coordination program between Primary Care and Geriatrics and Public Health services was activated. METHODS: 2,668 seniors were followed at 39 nursing homes. Data from new cases, active cases, mortality and place of treatment of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed with the measurement of the absolute number of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases and the frequency distribution. RESULTS: Between August 7th 2020 and February 26th 2021, 30 outbreaks occurred at 21 nursing homes. 300 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (11% of total residents). The daily average of active cases was 27,166 were hospitalized (55%). 66 patients died (22% of those infected), 54 of them (78%) at the hospital. 1,984 PCR tests were performed. The temporary profile of new cases did not follow a distribution ""in waves"" as in the community. Thirty-seven days after the start of the second dose of vaccination, there were no active cases until March 1st, when new cases were under study for possible vaccine leakage. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 at nursing homes after the first wave of the pandemic has apparently been lower. The transmission in these centers has followed a different distribution than at community. Mass vaccination has achieved the practical disappearance of the disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",qGUlqV

medical,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiologic agent of a non-contagious arthropod-borne disease transmitted to wild and domestic ruminants. BTV induces a large panel of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to lethal hemorrhagic fever. Despite the fact that BTV has been studied extensively, we still have little understanding of the molecular determinants of BTV virulence. In our report, we have performed a comparative yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening approach to search direct cellular targets of the NS4 virulence factor encoded by two different serotypes of BTV: BTV8 and BTV27. This led to identifying Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) as a new interactor of the BTV-NS4. In contrast to BTV8, 1, 4 and 25, NS4 proteins from BTV27 and BTV30 are unable to interact with WTAP. This interaction with WTAP is carried by a peptide of 34 amino acids (NS4(22−55)) within its putative coil-coiled structure. Most importantly, we showed that binding to WTAP is restored with a chimeric protein where BTV27-NS4 is substituted by BTV8-NS4 in the region encompassing residue 22 to 55. We also demonstrated that WTAP silencing reduces viral titers and the expression of viral proteins, suggesting that BTV-NS4 targets a cellular function of WTAP to increase its viral replication.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DXmztM

medical,"Platynosomum illiciens is a dicrocoeliid trematode from the biliary tract of warm-blooded vertebrates (felines, primates, marsupials, and birds) reported in different parts of the world. Although the veterinary relevance of platynosomosis in mammals, especially in domestic felines, has been increasingly evidenced in the scientific literature, studies involving avian disease caused by P. illiciens are comparatively scarce. In the present study, a female specimen of the American kestrel, Falco sparverius L., found dead, in November 2019, in Brazil, was necropsied. Parietal biliary effusion in the celomatic cavity was observed, suggesting biliary transudation and gallbladder stasis, which possibily preceded the distension and rupture of gallbladder noted during necropsy. In the microscopic analysis of the bile content, small trematodes were found and characterized as immature stages of Platynosomum after the morphological study. Partial sequences of the cox-1 gene enabled the identification of P. illiciens, with 100% similarity with previously sequenced sympatric isolates from mammals. The finding of immature specimens in a ruptured gallbladder strongly suggests a role for the parasite in biliary flow dysfunction, indicating acute platynosomosis as a clinically relevant and potentially fatal condition that has not yet been discussed.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",S5B9o4

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To understand how health departments implemented the response to the dual hazards of Heat Related Illness (HRI) and COVID-19 in Summer 2020. METHODS: We interviewed five health jurisdictions with a Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework HRI project to understand impacts to organizational roles and preparedness activities, capacity to respond to the heat season, challenges experienced with resources and personnel, and how partners influenced their capacity to respond to dual hazards. RESULTS: Health jurisdictions working in both heat preparedness and on the COVID-19 response highlighted three components as integral to maintaining public health capacity throughout the pandemic: 1) adapting to changing roles and responsibilities, 2) building and strengthening inter-organizational partnerships, and 3) maintaining flexibility through cross-training as themes to maintain the public health capacity throughout the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: With impacts of the changing climate, including resultant extreme events with subsequent public health impacts, simultaneous responses are likely to arise again in the future. Developing cross-training programs, fostering flexibility and adaptability within the workforce, and building and sustaining external partnerships can support health departments anticipating the need to respond to simultaneous public health hazards in the future.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",kZzCAl

medical,"Classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model with constant transmission rate and removal rate may not capture real world dynamics of epidemic due to complex influence of multiple external factors on the spread. On top of that transmission rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model. We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted with the trained model.

METHODS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the intervention, 12 for the 10-day intervention and 13 for the 21-day intervention. RESULTS: The intervention improved most of the NCDs risk factors for the 10-day intervention weight decreased by -4.3% (p < .001), BMI -4.1% (p < .001), SBP -16.3% (p = .002), DBP -11.8% (p = .004), fasting glucose -31.3% (p = .041), total cholesterol -12.8% (p < .001), LDL -13.9 (p = .017), triglycerides and HDL lack statistical significance, however, there was a reduction of -7.7% and -9% respectively.

medical,"The worldwide pandemic caused by COVID-19 represents a real challenge for clinicians working in every field of medicine. From radiologists to anesthesiologists, all specialists had to change their way of working and to rapidly learn new tasks and procedures. Importantly, some groups of individuals appear more vulnerable than others to the development of psychological issues. Typical coping strategies, endorsed by the general population and media, are represented by technology-based communication, reading, humor, and entertainment, such as watching TV or listening to music. However, not everyone disposes of the resources to cope with their own emotions using these strategies or may not perceive any real benefit. Insomnia and alterations of sleep patterns are indeed among the main issues reported during the pandemic. This is partially due to the changes in daily routines and habits, but also to anguish and internal tension. The era of COVID-19 is in fact the era of telepsychiatry: psychiatry and related disciplines are going through a real revolution. The direct, personal, empathic contact that we usually experiment with patients in the clinical setting has now to move virtually. Thus, there is an urgent need to adapt and tailor psychopathology to this new setting. In conclusion, the challenges that one is facing and will have to face in the near future should represent a stimulus for a real renovation of psychopathology.

medical,"Importance Since February 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world, with an epidemiological cluster in Lombardy, Italy. The viral communicability may be mediated by various body fluids, but insufficient information is available on the presence of the virus in human tears. Objectives To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in tears collected from patients with COVID-19 by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and to assess the association of virus presence with concomitant clinical conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study conducted between April 9 and May 5, 2020. The setting was intensive care units at Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Sette-Laghi Hospital, University of Insubria, in Varese, Lombardy, Italy. A conjunctival swab was performed in 91 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, which was clinically diagnosed by rRT-PCR assay on nasopharyngeal swabs and by radiological imaging. Conjunctival swabs from 17 additional healthy volunteer participants with no symptoms of COVID-19 were examined to evaluate the availability and applicability of the conjunctival swab test. Exposure SARS-CoV-2 detection by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on the collected samples obtained by conjunctival swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures Conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab results are reported, as well as demographic and clinical data. Results A total of 108 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [14.2] years; 55 female and 53 male) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR assay, including 91 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 17 were healthy volunteers. SARS-CoV-2 was found on the ocular surface in 52 of 91 patients with COVID-19 (57.1%; 95% CI, 46.3%-67.5%), with a wide variability in the mean viral load from both eyes. Among a subset of 41 patients, concordance of 63.0% (95% CI, 41.0%-81.0%) was found between positive conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab test results when performed within 2 days of each other. In 17 of these patients, nasopharyngeal swab results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In 10 of these 17 patients, conjunctival swab results were positive for the virus. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on the ocular surface in a large part of this cohort of patients with COVID-19, although the infectivity of this material could not be determined. Because patients may have positive test results with a conjunctival swab and negative results with a nasopharyngeal swab, use of the slightly invasive conjunctival swab may be considered as a supplementary diagnostic test.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RDqqYU

medical,"RATIONALE: An important public health strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic was the protection of people at risk of severe progressions of an infection; namely, older people and people with pre-existing conditions. OBJECTIVE: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people’s acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. METHOD: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). RESULTS: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults’ compliance with protective measures over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the behavioural responses of older adults to an ongoing threat and the associated uncertainty that is part of public communication about the pandemic and protective measures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",62PSPN

Other models of care developed during the pandemic around the world were reviewed including their capacity, total bed/ICU bed ratio and time of use. We particularly analyzed the common and differential characteristics of this type of facilities. IFEMA Exhibition Center was transformed into a temporary 1,300-bed hospital, which was in continuous operation for 42 days. A total of 3,817 people were treated, generally patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, 91% of whom had pneumonia. The average length of stay was 5 to 36 days. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (16.5%), diabetes mellitus (9.1%), COPD (6%), asthma (4.6%), obesity (2.9%) and dementia (1.6%). A total of 113 patients (3%) were transferred to another centers for aggravation, 19 (0.5%) were admitted to ICU and 16 patients (0.4%) died. An element of great help to reducing the overload of care in large hospitals during peaks of health emergencies could be these flexible structures capable of absorbing the excess of patients. These must be safe, breaking domestic transmission and guarantee social and emotional needs of patients. The success of these structures depends on delimitation in admission criteria taking into account the proportion of patients who may require, during admission, assistance in the critical care area.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",VItz85

medical,"The goal of this study was to develop an 89Zr-labeled anti-PD-L1 immune PET technique that can quantitatively monitor chemotherapy-mediated modulation of tumor PD-L1 expression in living subjects. Methods: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies underwent sulfohydryl moiety-specific conjugation with maleimide-deferoxamine (DFO) followed by 89Zr radiolabeling. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG was evaluated for radiochemical purity, specific activity and radiolabel stability. Parental CT26 colon cancer cells and CT26/PD-L1 cells engineered to stably overexpress PD-L1 underwent binding assays, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. In vivo pharmacokinetics was evaluated and tumor-bearing mice underwent biodistribution and PET studies after 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG injection. Results: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG synthesis was straightforward and efficient. SDS PAGE showed that reduction with TCEP produced half-antibody fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis estimated 2.18 DFOs conjugated per antibody, indicting site-specific conjugation at the hinge region disulfide bonds. High expressing CT26/PD-L1 cells showed 102.2 ± 6.7-fold greater 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding compared to weak expressing CT26 cells. Excellent target specificity was confirmed by a drastic reduction of CT26/PD-L1 cell binding to 3.0 ± 0.8% by excess cold antibody. Intravenous 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG followed bi-exponential blood clearance. Tissue activity assessed by PET/CT demonstrated decreases in major organ activity over 7 days, whereas high CT26/PD-L1 tumor activity was maintained. Again, this was suppressed by excess cold antibody. Treatment of CT26 cells with gemcitabine for 24 h augmented PD-L1 protein to 592.4 ± 114.2% of controls and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding. This was accompanied by increased AKT activation and reduced PTEN. In CT26 tumor mice, gemcitabine treatment substantially increased tumor uptake from 1.56 ± 0.48 to 6.24 ± 0.37 %ID/g (tumor/blood ratio: 34.7). Immunoblots revealed significant increases in tumor PD-L1 and activated AKT and a decrease of PTEN. Conclusion: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG showed specific targeting with favorable pharmacokinetic and PET imaging properties. Gemcitabine treatment upregulated cancer cell and tumor PD-L1 expression and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG uptake. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG PET may thus be useful for monitoring chemotherapy-mediated tumor PD-L1 modulation in living subjects.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Z5mBVs

medical,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected nearly 7 million individuals and claimed more than 0.4 million lives to date. There are several reports of gender differences related to infection and death due to COVID-19. This raises important questions such as “Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?”and “What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?”Emerging evidence has proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. From an immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females. Here we review the current knowledge about sex differences in susceptibility, the severity of infection and mortality, host immune responses, and the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ycubnJ

medical,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small population of heterogeneous tumor cells with the capacity of self-renewal and aberrant differentiation for immortality and divergent lineages of cancer cells. In contrast to bulky tumor cells, CSCs remain less differentiated and resistant to therapy even when targeted with tissue-specific antigenic markers. This makes CSCs responsible for not only tumor initiation, development, but also tumor recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that CSCs can undergo cell senescence, a non-proliferative state of cells in response to stress. While cell senescence attenuates tumor cell proliferation, it is commonly regarded as a tumor suppressive mechanism. However, mounting research indicates that CSC senescence also provides these cells with the capacity to evade cytotoxic effects from cancer therapy, exacerbating cancer relapse and metastasis. Recent studies demonstrate that senescence drives reprogramming of cancer cell towards stemness and promotes CSC generation. In this review, we highlight the origin, heterogeneity and senescence regulatory mechanisms of CSCs, the complex relationship between CSC senescence and tumor therapy, and the recent beneficial effects of senotherapy on eliminating senescent tumor cells.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gZAzzt

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.

The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic. Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead. Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice.

This prospective study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of catheter removal on postoperative day (POD) 2 versus POD 4 after LRP and its impact on urinary continence outcomes. METHODS One hundred and thirteen patients underwent LRP and were prospectively randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 57) had the urinary catheter removed on POD 2 while group 2 (n = 56) had the catheter removed on POD 4. The urine loss ratio (ULR) was defined as the weight of urine loss in the pad divided by the daily micturition volume. Continence was defined as a pad-free status. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in clinical features between groups 1 and 2. Acute urinary retention (AUR) after catheter removal occurred in 21 patients (18.6%) (13 (22.8%) in group 1 and 8 (14.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.244). The first-day mean ULR values were 1.16 ± 4.95 in group 1 and 1.02 ± 3.27 in group 2 (p = 0.870). The last-day mean ULR values were 0.57 ± 1.60 in group 1 and 2.78 ± 15.49 in group 2 (p = 0.353). Continence rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 21.8, 41.1, 58.0, and 71.4% in group 1 and 34.5, 66.0, 79.2, and 83.7% in group 2 (p = 0.138, 0.009, 0.024, and 0.146, respectively). In AUR cases, continence rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 0, 23.1, 38.5, and 54.5% in group 1 and 37.5, 75.0, 87.5, and 87.5% in group 2 (p = 0.017, 0.020, 0.027, and 0.127, respectively). A multivariate analysis identified AUR after catheter removal on POD 2 as the only predictive factor for incontinence 6 and 9 months after LRP (p = 0.030 and 0.018, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrated that early catheter removal on POD 2 after LRP may increase the risk of incontinence.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)-related pneumonia, referred to as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19), is a public health emergency as it carries high morbidity, mortality, and has no approved specific pharmacological treatments. In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). RESULTS: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-FIXnm

Method: we collected clinical records from 79 COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union hospital (China). Spearman's correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were employed. RESULTS: patients with elevated ferritin levels had a higher incidence of severity illness (50.0% vs 2.9%) and liver injury (52.3% vs 20.0%) when compared with patients with normal ferritin levels (p < 0.05). Ferritin could effectively identify severity illness (ROC area 0.873) and liver injury (ROC area 0.752). Elevated ferritin group showed longer viral clearance time (median 16 vs 6 days, p < 0.001) and in-hospital length (median 18 vs 10 days, p < 0.001). Conclusions: it suggests that ferritin could act as an easy-to-use tool to identify liver injury and severity illness and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

medical,"For this study, we examined how recognizing the writing process of calligraphy influences the cognitive and affective processes related to appreciating it, with the aim of contributing to both graphonomics and the psychology of aesthetics. To this end, we conducted two Web-based experiments in which some participants were instructed to view calligraphy by tracing it with their eyes (the tracing method), while others were told to feel free to think and imagine whatever they wanted. Study 1 (N = 103) revealed that the tracing method elicits stronger admiration, inspiration, and empathy in viewers. Study 2 (N = 87) showed that the tracing method decreases the average heart rate of those who do not frequently engage in calligraphy appreciation as they gaze at calligraphy for a minute-and-a-half (during the second half of the stimulus duration); this suggests that the tracing method could keep viewers from becoming bored while looking at calligraphy. In sum, the tracing method has positive effects on viewing calligraphy. From a broader perspective, the results imply that how in detail viewers recognize the process of creating an artwork will be a key determinant of art appreciation. In addition, our findings demonstrate how we can measure cardiac activities using the emerging technology of the photoplethysmogram (PPG).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",NZ3Uhj

medical,"INTRODUCTION In this study we investigated non-invasive, effort-independent measurement of ventilatory mechanics in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS Ventilatory mechanics were measured by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) in ALS patients and matched controls. Analysis determined whether OEP measurements correlated with standard clinical measures. RESULTS ALS patients (N = 18) had lower forced vital capacity percent predicted (55.2 ± 22.0 L) compared with controls (N = 15; 104.7 ± 16.2 L) and higher ventilatory inefficiency (49.2 ± 9.0 vs. 40.0 ± 3.5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both measures). Lower tidal volumes within the diaphragm area correlated with the dyspnea subscore calculated from the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (P = 0.031), and paradoxical movement of the ribcage compared with the abdominal compartment was seen in the most severe cases. CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of ventilatory mechanics in mild to severe ALS reveals dysfunction that is not readily detected by standard testing and ALS functional severity assessment measures.

medical,"This protocol aims to characterize patients with dual disorders (DD; comorbid major depression and schizophrenia) compared with patients with only a diagnosis of substance use disorder (SUD) and those with only a diagnosis of severe mental illness (SMI; major depression and schizophrenia), evaluating clinical and personality characteristics, circadian rhythmic functioning, genetic polymorphism and neuropsychological performance in order to obtain a clinical endophenotype of differential vulnerability for these diagnostic entities. Patients will be divided into three groups: DD (45 men with comorbid schizophrenia, 45 men and 30 women with major depression), SUD (n = 90, with a minimum of 30 women) and SMI males (45 with schizophrenia, 45 with major depression). All patients will be under treatment, with at least three months of SUD abstinence and/or with SMI in remission or with stabilized symptoms. Outpatients of both sexes with insufficient restoration of circadian rhythmicity with SUD (n = 30) and dual depression (n = 30) will be asked to participate in a second two-month study, being alternately assigned to the condition of the chronobiological adjuvant approach to the treatment of regular hour habits and exposure to light or to the usual treatment (control). The effect of the intervention and patient compliance will be monitored with a Kronowise KW6(®) ambulatory device during the first two weeks of treatment and again at weeks 4 and 8 weeks. After completing the evaluation, follow-up of the clinical evolution will be carried out at 3, 6 and 12 months. This project will allow us to analyze the functional impact of DD comorbidity and to develop the first study of chronobiological therapy in the treatment of SUD and dual depression, with results transferable to the clinical setting with cost-effective recommendations for a personalized approach.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KYX2EH

Yet none of these tools are commercially available in the market or practically viable for mass production and use in pandemic diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this context, we review the technological challenges and opportunities of current bio/chemical sensors and analytical tools by critically analyzing the bottlenecks which have hindered the implementation of advanced sensing technologies in pandemic diseases. We also describe in brief COVID-19 by comparing it with other pandemic strains such as that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for the identification of features that enable biosensing. Moreover, we discuss visualization and characterization tools that can potentially be used not only for sensing applications but also to assist in speeding up the drug discovery and vaccine development process. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging monitoring mechanism, namely wastewater-based epidemiology, for early warning of the outbreak, focusing on sensors for rapid and on-site analysis of SARS-CoV2 in sewage. To conclude, we provide holistic insights into challenges associated with the quick translation of sensing technologies, policies, ethical issues, technology adoption, and an overall outlook of the role of the sensing technologies in pandemics.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KBwq5k

medical,"BackgroundMask wearing contributes to the reduction of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In Switzerland, compulsory use of masks was introduced in indoor public spaces and later in schools. In the canton of Zurich, masks were introduced for secondary school children (grades 7-9) from November 2020, and for primary school children (grades 4-6) from February 2021- along with other protective measures against SARS-CoV-2. This study explored perceptions towards the usefulness of masks in school and public in a cohort of children and adolescents in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in January - May 2021. MethodsSchool children aged 10 to 17 years enrolled in Ciao Corona, a prospective school-based cohort study, responded to nested online surveys between January 12 to March 24 2021 (Q1) and March 10 to May 16 2021 (Q2). Secondary school children were surveyed at Q1 and Q2, and primary school children at Q2 only. Surveys for parents and their children included questions on childrens perception of the usefulness of masks and mask wearing behavior. Associations between perceived usefulness of masks and childs school level, gender, and parents educational attainment were analyzed with Pearsons and McNemars chi-squared tests. Free-text comments provided by children were classified into categories of expressed attitude towards mask wearing. Results595 (54% girls) and 1118 (52% girls) school children responded to online questionnaires at Q1 and Q2, respectively. More than half of school children perceived masks to be useful at school (Q1:60% and Q2:57%) and in public (Q1:69% and Q2:60%). Girls perceived masks as useful more often than boys (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 53%, in public: 64% versus 57%), and children of parents with high educational attainment more often than those of parents with lower educational attainment (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 49%, in public: 63% versus 54%). There were no differences in the perceived usefulness of masks among children in primary versus secondary school. At Q1 and Q2 each, about 20% of children provided individual statements about masks, of which 36% at Q1 and 16% at Q2 reported side-effects and discomfort such as skin irritations, headache or difficulties breathing during physical education. ConclusionApproximately 60% of school children perceived masks at school and in public places as useful. A small but non-negligible proportion of children reported discomfort and side-effects that should be considered to ensure high adherence to mask wearing among school children. Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717 CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD STATEMENTWorldwide about 150 countries fully closed their schools at some point during the coronavirus pandemic, while other countries - such as Switzerland - kept schools open almost all the time. However, among other protective measures, children in secondary school (aged approximately 14-16 years) had to wear masks since November 2020, and older children in primary school (aged 11-13 years) - since February 2021. As part of the large study Ciao Corona based in schools in Switzerland, we wanted to learn how children perceive the usefulness of masks in school and public. Children and their parents completed questionnaires in January-March (595 secondary school children) and March-May 2021 (1118 secondary and primary school children). We found that about 60% of children perceived masks to be useful at school and in public. Girls perceived masks as useful more often than boys, and children of parents with university or college education more often than those of parents with lower education. About 7- 9% of children reported side-effects and discomfort such as skin irritations, headache or difficulties breathing during physical education. Although side-effects were not frequently reported, they should be considered to ensure high adherence to mask wearing among school children.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_roiMN

medical,"OBJECTIVE Vascular sealing with an energy vessel sealing system during lung resection may allow surgeons to treat small vessels with minimal dissection, possibly decreasing likelihood of injury. Few large prospective trials have examined the proximal sides of vessels not ligated in addition to sealing during surgery. We therefore assessed feasibility of an energy device to seal pulmonary artery and vein branches without further ligation. METHODS This prospective, preoperative registration study at 2 institutions evaluated safety of energy sealing with the LigaSure (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), with no additional reinforcing material such as suture ligation, for pulmonary vessels as large as 7 mm during anatomic lung resection (cohort 1 study). A postoperative hemorrhage occurred in the 128th case, so a cohort 2 study proceeded after we changed inclusion criterion for pulmonary arteries from a maximum of 7 mm to a maximum of 5 mm. RESULTS In cohort 1 (n = 128) and cohort 2 (n = 200), 216 and 250 pulmonary arteries and 189 and 213 pulmonary veins, respectively, were treated with energy sealing. Overall postoperative hemorrhage rate was 0.3% (1/328 patients); however, no serious postoperative complications were associated with energy sealing among the 200 patients in cohort 2. Subsequent inspection of the torn artery stump confirmed that the bleeding in the 128th case was in an area adjacent to the sealing zone. CONCLUSIONS Energy sealing without reinforcement allows secure treatment during lung resection of pulmonary arteries as large as 5 mm in diameter and pulmonary veins as large as 7 mm.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WjEbVi

medical,"Aim Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected perinatal women worldwide. Our study aimed to describe the opinions of perinatal women about COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, and practices. Methods Pregnant and Postnatal women (n=223) were included and those who did not consent, and less than 16 weeks' gestation, were excluded. SPSS version 26 was used for descriptive statistics. Results Most of the women had good knowledge about COVID 19 regarding its nature, transmission, & symptoms. Their information sources were news (139/206=67.5%) and the internet (85/206=41%). Women understood the uncertainty around its effect on pregnancy; as it is a novel infection. A substantial number of women were concerned (130/206=63%), upset by social isolation (86/206=42%), negatively impacted by the visitor restrictions in hospital (154/206=75%), and faced COVID-19 related reduced household finances (97/206=47%).

medical,"BACKGROUND: Although there are increasing concerns on mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, no large-scale population-based studies have examined the associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and subsequent mental health. METHODS: : This study analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the PsyCorona Survey that included 54,845 participants from 112 countries, of which 23,278 participants are representative samples of 24 countries in terms of gender and age. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing. RESULTS: : All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised β=-0.171, median SE=0.004, P<0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised β=-0.214, SE=0.029, P<0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress. Among the 54 multilevel linear regressions of mental health on risk perception and emotion, 42 models showed a strong mediation effect, where no significant direct effect of risk perception was found after controlling for emotion (P>0.05). LIMITATIONS: Reliance on self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS: : Risk perception of COVID-19 was associated with emotion and ultimately mental health.

After 5days doctor discharged him from hospital and prescribed to give him budecort 100 2X2 puffs and motair lc kid 5 ml everyday for 3 months. He was very fine for 1 month and we stopped medications as we were unsure about steroids. again after 2 months he had severe dry cough and spasms.no fever now. We took him to hospital emergency where doctor nebulized him once and told he can be treated at home with levolin puffs every 6 hours for 4 days, budecort and montair to be continued for another 3 months... We wnated to know if this is asthma and he said he can t say now. This are allergic colds and he shuld be on montair lc and budecort and this may go away after child is 5 years.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted healthcare services for kidney disease patients. Lockdown and social distancing were mandated worldwide, resulting in closure of medical services. The diagnosis of various kidney diseases may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic because non-urgent tests and visits were postponed due to closure of medical services during the lockdown. METHODS: We here report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a total number of 209 native kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy for diagnosis in a retrospective observational study from a tertiary hospital in Germany. RESULTS: The lockdown period in March and April 2020 primarily affected patients admitted to the normal medical ward with a compensatory increased rate of renal biopsies in the postlockdown phase. In addition, there was a shift toward more patients admitted with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon of an increased number of patients with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic was specifically observed in a subgroup with hypertensive nephropathy requiring renal biopsy and associated with increased proteinuria, not attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown period itself. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of identifying a subpopulation susceptible to closure of medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnostic delay of specific kidney diseases. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic should be regarded as a risk factor especially in patients with diseases other than COVID-19 primarily admitted to the normal medical ward.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",YrC3A1

This study examines the effects of two positive psychological resources on the mental health of Indian citizens during the early days of the lockdown. The effects of psychological capital (PsyCap) and internal locus of control on psychological distress of people via affect balance were tested. Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control.

medical,"The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19 has become a global pandemic that is spreading rapidly and has caused a global health emergency. Hence, there is an urgent need of the hour to discover effective drugs to control the pandemic caused by this virus. Under such conditions, it would be imperative to repurpose already known drugs which could be a quick and effective alternative to discovering new drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-COV-2 is an attractive drug target because of its essential role in the processing of the majority of the non-structural proteins which are translated from viral RNA. Herein, we report the high-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking studies to search for the best potential inhibitors against Mpro from FDA approved drugs available in the ZINC database as well as the natural compounds from the Specs database. Our studies have identified six potential inhibitors of Mpro enzyme, out of which four are commercially available FDA approved drugs (Cobicistat, Iopromide, Cangrelor, and Fortovase) and two are from Specs database of natural compounds (Hopeaphenol and Cyclosieversiodide-A). While Cobicistat and Fortovase are known as HIV drugs, Iopromide is a contrast agent and Cangrelor is an anti-platelet drug. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using GROMACS were performed to calculate the stability of the top-ranked compounds in the active site of Mpro. After extensive computational studies, we propose that Cobicistat and Hopeaphenol show potential to be excellent drugs that can form the basis of treating COVID-19 disease.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate how age and underlying medical conditions affect the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they should be weighed while prioritising vaccinations against COVID-19. METHODS: This population-based register study includes all SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test-positive cases until 24 Feb 2021, based on the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The cases were linked to other registers to identify presence of predisposing factors and severe outcomes (hospitalisation, intensive care treatment, death). The odds of severe outcomes were compared in those with and without the pre-specified predisposing factors using logistic regression. Furthermore, population-based rates were compared between those with a given predisposing factor and those without any of the specified predisposing factors using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Age and various comorbidities were found to be predictors of severe COVID-19. Compared to 60–69-year-olds, the odds ratio (OR) of death was 7.1 for 70–79-year-olds, 26.7 for 80–89-year-olds, and 55.8 for ≥ 90-year-olds. Among the 20–69-year-olds, chronic renal disease (OR 9.4), malignant neoplasms (5.8), hematologic malignancy (5.6), chronic pulmonary disease (5.4), and cerebral palsy or other paralytic syndromes (4.6) were strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality; severe disorders of the immune system (8.0), organ or stem cell transplant (7.2), chronic renal disease (6.7), and diseases of myoneural junction and muscle (5.5) were strongly associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation. Type 2 diabetes and asthma, two very common comorbidities, were associated with all three outcomes, with ORs from 2.1 to 4.3. The population-based rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with age. Taking the 60–69-year-olds as reference, the rate ratio was highest (3.0) for 20–29-year-olds and < 1 for 70–79-year-olds and 80–89-year-olds. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities predispose for severe COVID-19 among younger ages. In vaccine prioritisation both the risk of infection and the risk of severe outcomes, if infected, should be considered.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",SITzN6
medical,"The lack of efficacious vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is a limiting factor in the prevention and control of tuberculosis (TB), the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Improvement or replacement of the BCG vaccine with one that reliably protects all age groups is urgent. Concerns exist that antigens currently being evaluated are too homogeneous. To identify new protective antigens, we screened 1,781 proteins from a high-throughput proteome-wide protein purification study for antigenic activity. Forty-nine antigens (34 previously unreported) induced antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 4,452 TB and suspected TB patients and 167 healthy donors. Three (Rv1485, Rv1705c, and Rv1802) of the 20 antigens evaluated in a BALB/c mouse challenge model showed protective efficacy, reducing lung CFU counts by 66.2%, 75.8%, and 60%, respectively. Evaluation of IgG2a/IgG1 ratios and cytokine release indicated that Rv1485 and Rv1705c induce a protective Th1 immune response. Epitope analysis of PE/PPE protein Rv1705c, the strongest candidate, identified a dominant epitope in its extreme N-terminal domain accounting for 90% of its immune response. Systematic preclinical assessment of antigens Rv1485 and Rv1705c is warranted.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",kfQEEK

It seems pretty close under the skin; so weve been hoping that it is some kind of skin blemish or inflamation (maybe a boil, etc). However, it doesnt seem to be progressing in any way. It is about half an inch long and the shape is oblong. It is quite hard, but it does have some spongy feeling. He can feel it constantly even when hes sitting still and especially when he moves, and its causing a burning pain and headaches. It is especially painful when he tries to sleep, or more specifically when he tries to lay down on it. He has a family history of cancer (brain tumor in particular) in both his mother and father. Because of this family history, we intend to be very careful with potential signs of anything that could be cancer-related; but hes only 35 years old. Is a fatty tissue deposit usually marked by this burning pain, or is this symptom more likely related to something malignant?

medical,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the world, while the advance of TBI management is rather limited in recent years. The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely reported in TBI patients and animal models, and certain miRNAs have been identified as the emerging biomarkers of TBI. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulatory mechanism of TBI remains unclear. To demonstrate the effect of miR-146a mimic on TBI-induced neural damages, TBI mouse model was constructed by cortical impact injury (CCI). The chemokine levels were examined by ELISA assays. Behavioral experiments were used to estimate the impact of miR-146a mimics on neurological functions in mice. Western blot assays were performed to demonstrate the protein levels. qRT-PCR assays were utilized to investigate the expression alteration of RNA levels. It was found that miR-146a was upregulated both in brain and serum in TBI mice. miR-146a mimic downregulated inflammatory cytokines secretion in mouse brain. The NF-&#954;B signaling pathway was inhibited by miR-146a mimic. miR-146a treatment attenuated the impact caused by TBI to mouse brain and improve the long-term neurological function.

medical,"This article describes the development and administration of a survey to identify early childhood educators' successes and barriers when delivering remote instruction (e.g., online whole or small group instruction) during the COVID-19 pandemic to children 2-5 years old. The survey was developed using procedures outlined by the commonly accepted stages of an instrument development process. Content validity was established using four approaches: (a) identification of the purpose of the survey, (b) creation of a blueprint of items, (c) cognitive interviews, and (d) expert panel review. A total of 1,053 early childhood educators began the survey, with 808 (77%) of the responses included because educators met the inclusion criteria of working in the United States and responding to at least one question related to remote instruction. The survey contained 37 closed-ended and six open-ended items covering eight domains: (a) demographic information; (b) preparation, guidelines, and materials for remote learning; (c) caregiver communication and engagement; (d) assessment; (e) instruction; (f) educators' levels of confidence before and after remote learning; (g) access to services (i.e., wraparound and/or special education); and (h) planning for the return to face-to-face instruction. Both quantitative (descriptive, t-test, regression, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests) and consensual qualitative research analyses were applied to summarize the survey results. Findings from this survey indicated that even with limited or no guidance from administrators, educators successfully adapted to remote instruction and their levels of confidence increased over time. Ongoing improvements need to be made to sustain regular communication with all families, to offer access to technology (i.e., devices and internet), to administer assessments or universal screeners, and to provide cohesive guidelines and expectations. Results from this study begin to shed light on early childhood educators' adaptation to remote instruction as a result of COVID-19.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a serious health concern. Repurposing of existing drugs indicated for other conditions seems to be the first choice for immediate therapeutic management. The quality of early evidence favoring the different treatment options needs to be apprised for informed decision-making. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, we apprised the quality of available evidence for different therapeutic options and also the basis for different treatment guidelines. To include all studies that are in different stages of publication, we also included studies from the preprint servers BioRxiv and MedRxiv and published studies from PubMed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5621 articles and included 22 studies for the systematic review. Based on our study, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, convalescent sera, ritonavir/lopinavir, tocilizumab and arbidol were evaluated as therapeutic options. The data from different study designs reveal contradictory findings except for convalescent sera for which the evidence available is only from case series. Based on this early evidence, various national guidelines recommend remdesivir, convalescent sera, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine in different subsets of patients. CONCLUSION: Establishing consensus with respect to the end points to be assessed for respiratory viruses may enhance the quality of evidence in case of future pandemics. The systematic review highlighted the lacuna and methodologic deficiency in early clinical evidence and included an update on different therapeutic management guidelines. Further clinical evidence from the ongoing trials may lead to evolution of treatment guidelines with the addition of more therapeutic options.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HJt24f

Here, we report the generation of homotrimeric RBD immunogens from different sarbecoviruses using a stabilized, immune-silent trimerization tag. We find that that a cocktail of homotrimeric sarbecovirus RBDs can elicit a neutralizing response to all components even in context of prior SARS-CoV-2 imprinting. Importantly, the cross-neutralizing antibody responses are focused towards conserved RBD epitopes outside of the ACE-2 receptor-binding motif.

What would you recommend for it to subside? I have uploaded my lump photos. It is not painful even if I touch the lump with my tongue. After doing warm salt water gargle, the lump reduced a bit.

medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020. Response to this ongoing pandemic requires extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain its impact and limit further transmission. Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R0 (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following the implementation of various interventions (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the expected disease severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the likely true infection rate is often orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone. In this review, we highlight the critical role played by mathematical modelling to understand COVID-19 thus far, the challenges posed by data availability and uncertainty, and the continuing utility of modelling-based approaches to guide decision making and inform the public health response. Unless otherwise stated, all bracketed error margins correspond to the 95% credible interval (CrI) for reported estimates.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XD6xO8

medical,"The spike protein is a most promising target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. But the apparently high rate of mutations makes the development of antiviral inhibitors a challenge. Here a methodology is presented to try and predict mutation hot-spot sites, where a small local change in spike protein’s structure can lead to a large scale conformational effect, and change the protein’s biological function. The methodology starts with a systematic physics based investigation of the spike protein’s Cα backbone in terms of its local topology. This topological investigation is then combined with a statistical examination of the pertinent backbone fragments; the statistical analysis builds on a comparison with high resolution Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Putative mutation hot-spot sites are identified as proximal sites to bifurcation points that can change the local topology of the Cα backbone in an essential manner. The likely outcome of a mutation, if it indeed occurs, is predicted by a comparison with residues in best-matching PDB fragments together with general stereochemical considerations. The detailed methodology is developed using the already observed D614G mutation as an example. This is a mutation that could have been correctly predicted by the present approach. Several additional examples of potential hot-spot residues are identified and analyzed in detail, some of them are found to be even better candidates for a mutation hot-spot than D614G. Significance statement A novel approach to predict mutation hot-spots in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is presented. The approach introduces new topology based techniques to biophysical protein research. For a proof-of-concept the approach is described with the notorious D614G mutation of the spike protein as an example. It is shown that this mutation could have been correctly predicted by the present methods. Several additional mutation hot-spots are then identified and a number of them are shown to be topologically similar to the observed D614G mutation. The methodology can be used to design effective drugs and antibodies against the spike protein. It can also be employed more generally, whenever one needs to search for and identify mutation hot-spots in a protein.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sZMgaO

medical,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is an ectoenzyme located in the outer membrane of a variety of cells. Proteomic profiling indicates an increased expression of CD13 in phagocytes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CD13 on the internalization and intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis in monocytes. METHODS: Magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy were used to observe interactions between CD13 and M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial entry and intracellular survival in monocytes were assessed with and without anti‐CD13 antibody (WM15 and WM47) using flow cytometry and colony formation assay. RESULTS: By using magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy, M. tuberculosis was found to be capable of binding to either soluble CD13 or membranous CD13 on monocytes. Flow cytometry showed that pretreatment of monocytes with WM15 or WM47 reduced the number of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Collectively, the data suggest that CD13 is a binding and entry receptor for M. tuberculosis on monocytes. Treatment of infected monocytes showed a greater effect of WM47 than WM15 in reducing the intracellular colonization of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that specific epitopes of CD13 may play an important role modulating intracellular M. tuberculosis survival. CONCLUSIONS: CD13 acts as a receptor for M. tuberculosis on human monocytes. The molecule facilitates internalization, and interaction of CD13 with an anti‐CD13 antibody reduces intracellular M. tuberculosis survival.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4tFQYQ

medical,"Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from the provider notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR.

Addressing this question, we explored how individuals with greater COVID-19 concern perceive migrants as a greater threat and show prejudice against them, indirectly through the mechanism of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations.This study was conducted in two European countries: Malta and Italy. Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor.The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",AkgPrf
medical,"Hand hygiene is one of the effective measures for reducing the transmission of infections. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing ethanol or isopropanol are considered efficient alternatives to handwashing with water and soap. Despite being effective against a broad-spectrum of microbes, fining an effective alternative to the alcohol-based hand sanitizers became a necessity owning to the limitations associated with their use, such as skin dryness, irritant contact dermatitis, and intoxication upon their accidental ingestion. Furthermore, in certain circumstances when the demand for alcohol exceeds the supply, like in the current COVID19 pandemic, formulating an effective non-alcoholic hand sanitizer would be a potential solution. Therefore, in this study, a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer containing benzalkonium chloride (BKC) as an active ingredient was prepared and evaluated as a less irritant and more persistent hand sanitizer gel. The hand gel was characterized by pH, viscosity, and spreadability. Results showed that this product has low viscosity, high spreadability and pH of 6.3, which is less likely to cause skin irritation. The antibacterial assessment (zone of inhibition) of the BKC-based hand sanitizer demonstrated antibacterial activities against nine out of eleven gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, while the acceptability study on ten participants showed no signs of skin irritation nor redness upon its application. Consequently, this non-alcoholic based hand sanitizer is suggested as a potential alternative to alcohol-based hand gels.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5bJ1XS

medical,"BACKGROUND: If healthcare professionals perceive that patients strongly expect to be prescribed antibiotics, inappropriate prescriptions may result. As it is unknown whether this happens more often with certain patient groups, we explored whether general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists perceived such expectations when they provided antibiotics to immigrant patients. METHODS: Ten GPs and five pharmacists from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were interviewed on the basis of a semi-structured topic guide. Atlas.ti software was then used to conduct a thematic analysis. RESULTS: GPs felt that immigrant patients, especially those who had arrived recently, were more likely to expect to receive antibiotics than native Dutch patients. However, these expectations had decreased over the last years and did not always lead immigrants to exert pressure on them. Except for language barriers, the factors reported by GPs to influence their antibiotic prescribing behaviour were unrelated to patients’ immigrant background. If there was a language barrier, GPs experienced greater diagnostic uncertainty and needed additional time to obtain and communicate correct information. To overcome language barriers, they often used point-of-care testing to convince patients that antibiotics were unnecessary. Although pharmacists rarely experienced problems dispensing antibiotics to immigrants, they and GPs both struggled to find effective ways of overcoming language barriers, and stressed the need for multi-language support materials. CONCLUSION: While pharmacists rarely experience any problems providing antibiotics to immigrants, GPs regularly face language barriers with immigrant patients, which complicate the diagnostic process and communicating information in the limited available time. This sometimes leads antibiotics to be prescribed inappropriately.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dDMOWM

But I have never been well enough to manage and have been bed ridden with; extreme pain, vertgo and vomiting when sitting or standing long, spinal headaches, temporary partial paralysis in limbs and head etc, various pain sensations - some of which are severe etc etc etc. But the most horrific pain is an unbearable pain deep in my sacrum at the site of the myelogram, that caused my arachnoiditis. After a problematic colonoscopy 8 years ago the pain in my sacrum has been more intense and my bowel periodicaly produces such severe pain I cannot manage it. I also have a hiatis hernia , constant nausea, vomitting with severe pain, along with bouts of diorrea. So I lose my meds easily, putting me in a cycle of pain we cannot control. Since immigrating I have not found any knowledgable GP s so I get no advice or refferals and my full time Caregiver has no help, leaving us to manage alone. My old GP told us my meds would need revising yearly as pain levels will only increase as the nerves are damaged and that gradual paralysis will happen. But we have tried for 2 years to get a reveiw to see what stage I am at and increase pain medication etc. However all the Doctors here seem to think arachnoiditis is just long term pain rather than the insidious disease it really is. The pain I go through is so severe I never even knew it existed and we do not understand why Doctors are happy to repeat my scripts, but dont understand that the pain levels increase with the progression of the disease and my meds need reveiwing. Most Doctors do not want to take me and very few even prescribe these kind of meds. Due to selfish drug abusers who never think of the suffering Patients in real pain go through, just so these addicts can get their highs. Specialists authorise my meds and the GP just issues them. But why prescribe a dose which will not even allow me to function in the community and have some quality of life? When I first went on these meds they worked and I got some of my life back. But just like my GP advised; the pain levels and my functions got worse with time, so why dont they increase my dose? I have been told by a few Doctors that my dose is small so what is the difference? If the pain is worse than death why dont they stop it and prevent it? Some GP s go on about addiction to my meds but I have no history and no symptoms of drug addiction or abuse and considering I have absolutely no life with this incurable disease addiction is the least of my worries. Doctors here refuse to discuss arachnoiditis and will not help.

medical,"Liupao tea, a drink homologous to medicine and food. It can treat dysentery, relieve heat, remove dampness, and regulate the intestines and stomach. The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 µmol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent. This study unleashed that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , and Liupao tea has a certain significance as a tea drink for the prevention of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The objective of this study was to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of Liupao tea with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol, among them, the enzyme activity experiment shows that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , it can be used as a potential SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor. We predicted that the understandings gained in the current research may evidence that Liupao tea has a certain significance as a tea drink for the prevention of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",76OQqz

medical,"OBJECTIVES: Some studies suggested more COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among racial and ethnic minorities. To inform public health practice, the COVID-19-associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) quantified associations between race/ethnicity, census tract socioeconomic indicators, and COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates. METHODS: Using data from COVID-NET population-based surveillance reported during March 1–April 30, 2020 along with socioeconomic and denominator data from the US Census Bureau, we calculated COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates by racial/ethnic and census tract-level socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: Among 16,000 COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 34.8% occurred among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 36.3% among non-Hispanic Black (Black) persons, and 18.2% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. Age-adjusted COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate were 151.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 147.1–156.1) in census tracts with >15.2%–83.2% of persons living below the federal poverty level (high-poverty census tracts) and 75.5 (95% CI: 72.9–78.1) in census tracts with 0%–4.9% of persons living below the federal poverty level (low-poverty census tracts). Among White, Black, and Hispanic persons living in high-poverty census tracts, age-adjusted hospitalization rates were 120.3 (95% CI: 112.3–128.2), 252.2 (95% CI: 241.4–263.0), and 341.1 (95% CI: 317.3–365.0), respectively, compared with 58.2 (95% CI: 55.4–61.1), 304.0 (95%: 282.4–325.6), and 540.3 (95% CI: 477.0–603.6), respectively, in low-poverty census tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were highest in high-poverty census tracts, but rates among Black and Hispanic persons were high regardless of poverty level. Public health practitioners must ensure mitigation measures and vaccination campaigns address needs of racial/ethnic minority groups and people living in high-poverty census tracts.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XbdxV0

medical,"PURPOSE: This review was aimed to synthesise the best available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir were searched via databases and other sources from December 2019 to December 2020. Two independent reviewers performed literature screening, data extraction and assessment of risk bias. Seven studies involving 3686 patients were included. RESULTS: Treatment with remdesivir was associated with an increase in clinical recovery rate by 21% (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.08–1.35) on day 7 and 29% (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.22–1.37) on day 14. The likelihoods of requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation in the remdesivir group were lower than in the placebo group by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54–0.99) and 47% (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39–0.72), respectively. Remdesivir-treated patients showed a 39% (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46–0.79) reduction in the risk of mortality on day 14 compared to the control group; however, there was no significant difference on day 28. Serious adverse effects (SAEs) were significantly less common in patients treated with remdesivir, with an absolute risk difference of 6% (RD −0.06; 95% CI −0.09 to −0.03). CONCLUSION: Despite conditional recommendation against its use, remdesivir could still be effective in early clinical improvement; reduction of early mortality and avoiding high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was also well tolerated without significant SAEs compared to placebo, yet available evidence from clinical studies support the need to conduct close monitoring.

medical,"In the Covid-19 pandemic, media stories and government reports have emphasized the heightened risk of being “old” and placed a spotlight on the way we think and talk about older adults and aging. In this symposium we investigate how the pandemic and the public discourse about older adults has shaped views of aging in different countries. Bellingtier et al. report on German children’s views of older adults before and during the pandemic. Children placed greater distance between themselves and older adults both before and after the pandemic, suggesting early ageism in children that predates the pandemic. Levy et al. provide experimental evidence that media stereotypes about aging and Covid-19 influence the mental health of older American adults, both in positive and negative. Schwartz and Ayalon found that greater perceptions of age-based discrimination in the healthcare system by Israeli adults 50+ were significantly related to greater Covid-19 worries. Greater worry can motivate older adults to take precautions, but be detrimental if it becomes too high. In line with this finding, Tingvold et al. found in a study with older adults from Luxembourg that more Covid-19 worry predicted feeling older four months later, but only for those in worse health. Finally, Terracciano examined longitudinal change in subjective age and found that American adults reported feeling younger after the emergence of Covid-19 than before, suggesting that perceptions of aging partly reflect a coping process to counter the negativity in the media.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",wY70OU

medical,"The epidemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the generation of a large number of waste surgical masks. In recent years, pyrolysis is considered to be an environmental-friendly and efficient method to dispose such solid waste. In this work, the thermal degradation behaviors, kinetic parameters, thermodynamic parameters, pyrolytic products and chemical reactions of typical surgical face mask waste were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in inert atmosphere. It is concluded that the surgical face mask waste pyrolysis in nitrogen can be considered to be a one-step reaction. In addition, the mean E (activation energy) value and the mean A (pre-exponential factor) value are 237.19 kJ/mol and 1.36 × 1014 min−1, respectively. g(α) = (−ln(1-α))2/3 (reaction model) may be utilized to characterize the surgical face mask waste pyrolysis in nitrogen. The above kinetic parameters are capable to estimate the surgical face mask waste pyrolysis behaviors in nitrogen. Thermodynamic parameters suggest that the surgical face mask waste pyrolysis can be considered to be an endothermic and non-spontaneous reaction. Inorganic substances, alkanes, alkenes, naphthenic hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones are the major volatile products. The amount of the aliphatic compounds is the highest.

medical,"After gaining entry through ACE2 aided by TMPRSS2, the SARS-CoV-2 causes serious complications of the cardiovascular system leading to myocarditis and other myocardial injuries apart from causing lung, kidney and brain dysfunctions. Here in this review, we are going to divulge the cellular and immunological mechanisms behind the cardiovascular, thrombotic and platelet impairments that are caused in COVID-19. In addition, we also propose the significance of various anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic phytochemicals in the treatment of COVID-19. The virus induces many immune-modulatory cytokines and chemokines which help in the intravascular coagulation and create a pro-thrombotic environment along with pulmonary embolism and thrombocytopenia. Different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their granular contents regulate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial and platelet dysfunctions which correlate the involvement of platelets with myocardial injury and intravascular thrombi directly or indirectly. Hence, by exploiting the natural bioactive compounds from medicinal plants and inhibiting the platelet mediated thrombus formation can be beneficial for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jngdEx

medical,"Alopecia is a distressing condition caused by the dysregulation of anagen, catagen, and telogen in the hair cycle. Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) regulate the hair cycle and play important roles in hair growth and regeneration. Myristoleic acid (MA) increases Wnt reporter activity in DPCs. However, the action mechanisms of MA on the stimulation of anagen signaling in DPCs is not known. In this study, we evaluated the effects of MA on anagen-activating signaling pathways in DPCs. MA significantly increased DPC proliferation and stimulated the G2/M phase, accompanied by increasing cyclin A, Cdc2, and cyclin B1. To elucidate the mechanism by which MA promotes DPC proliferation, we evaluated the effect of MA on autophagy and intracellular pathways. MA induced autophagosome formation by decreasing the levels of the phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (phospho-mTOR) and increasing autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3II (LC3II). MA also increased the phosphorylation levels of Wnt/β-catenin proteins, such as GSK3β (Ser(9)) and β-catenin (Ser(552) and Ser(675)). Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, attenuated the MA-induced increase in β-catenin nuclear translocation. Moreover, XAV939 reduced MA-induced effects on cell cycle progression, autophagy, and DPC proliferation. On the other hand, MA increased the levels of phospho (Thr(202)/Tyr(204))-extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK). MA-induced ERK phosphorylation led to changes in the expression levels of Cdc2, Atg7 and LC3II, as well as DPC proliferation. Our results suggest that MA promotes anagen signaling via autophagy and cell cycle progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK pathways in DPCs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",o1kmdc

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The hospital admissions load and how long each patient will stay in the hospital should be known to prevent the overwhelming of the health system during coronavirus disease 2019 era. Even though the length of hospital stay could vary due to different factors, the factors that affect the stay are not well characterized yet, particularly in the resource-limited settings. Knowing the time spent by the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the hospital and its associated factors are important to prioritize mobilizing resources, such as beds, pharmacological and non-pharmacological supplies, and health personnel. Therefore, this study was intended to determine the median and identify factors associated with the length of hospital stay among coronavirus disease 2019 cases. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was implemented on 394 randomly selected hospitalized patients. Epidata Version 3.1 software was used for data entry, and further analysis was done using Stata version 14.2 software. Frequencies, median with interquartile range, and chi-square test were performed. A logistic regression model was used to identify the association between outcome and explanatory variables. The statistical significance was declared at p-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The analysis was done for a total of 394 cases admitted for coronavirus disease 2019. The median age of the study participants was 40 years with interquartile range of 28–60 years. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days with the interquartile range of 8–17 days. The patients presented with shortness of breathing (AOR = 2.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.33–5.66), incident organ failure (AOR = 3.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.15–11.58), increased leukocyte count (AOR = 0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.91–0.99), and blood urea nitrogen (AOR = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.97–0.99) had a significant association with prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the proportion of patients stayed above the median hospital stay of the total patients was 185 (46.9%) with the median length of 12 (interquartile range = 8–17) days. Patients presented with difficulty of breathing, had incident organ failure, had decreased leukocyte, and blood urea nitrogen level should be estimated to stay longer in the hospital. Hence, patients with prolonged hospital length of stay associating factors should be expected to consume more pharmacological and non-pharmacological resources during hospital care receiving.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cXEXKR

medical,"BACKGROUND The cause of emergence agitation (EA) in children is unknown. Rapid emergence from inhaled anesthesia has been implicated because EA is more common with sevoflurane than with halothane. A dose-dependent effect of sevoflurane, which increases seizure-like electroencephalogram activity, has also been proposed. METHODS To determine whether depth of anesthesia as measured by bispectral index (BIS) affects EA, 40 ASA physical status I to II children aged 2 to 8 years undergoing ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized controlled trial of low-normal (40-45, deep) versus high-normal (55-60, light) anesthesia. To distinguish transient irritability from severe EA, the primary outcome was first-stage postanesthesia care unit (PACU I) peak Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, with secondary outcomes of PAED and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores at emergence, postoperative fentanyl dose, emergence time, and discharge time. Subjects received a standard anesthesia protocol with oral midazolam followed by mask induction with sevoflurane 8%, fentanyl 1 to 1.5 μg/kg IV (then as needed), neuromuscular blockade, and endotracheal intubation. Providers titrated expired sevoflurane (in N2O 67%) from 0.5% to 3% to maintain BIS range. PAED, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were measured at emergence, at PACU I arrival, and during PACU I stay. RESULTS There was little difference between the groups in the primary outcome, peak PACU I PAED score (light: 7.7 ± 4.6; deep: 8.6 ± 5.3; mean difference, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.1 to -2.3; effect size, 0.18).

medical,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a challenge for treating people with OCD and it could be postulated that those with OCD fearing contamination might be more affected in current circumstances. Although there have been some studies already published, results have been heterogeneous and conflicting; possibly because of different populations or geographical locations examined. In this preliminary study we aim to identify the impact of the pandemic on the severity of OCD, as measured by Y-BOCS scores. To our knowledge, it is the first UK study of this kind and the only study that examines change in Y-BOCS scores over such a long time period. METHOD: Patients were identified from national OCD unit referral databases at Springfield Hospital. Referrals from March 2019–March 2020 were examined and patients included if they had a diagnosis of OCD, were accepted by the service following initial assessment and sufficient data were available. This preliminary study focused only on Y-BOCS to assess clinician-rated severity of OCD. Y-BOCS scores were compared from different time periods correlating to the progression of COVID-19. ‘Pre-pandemic’ score was taken from Jan–Dec 2019 or, if not available, from Jan–23 March 2020 (prior to UK lockdown). ‘Pandemic’ score was taken as the most recent rating from April 2020 onwards. RESULT: 21 patients were included. All treated as outpatients (although 9 had undergone previous inpatient treatment during the time period above). 81% showed improvement in Y-BOCS score between pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods, with an overall mean decrease in Y-BOCS of 10.3. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study indicates that severity of OCD decreased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. It may be that patients found it easier to access remote appointments, or perhaps the pandemic environment of being encouraged to stay at home and limiting unnecessary contact may have allowed limited opportunity for exposure. It might be that the pandemic provided a reason for patients to be avoidant of potential contamination thereby leading to a perceived rather than real improvement in Y-BOCS scores. Identification of specific contributing factors is beyond the scope of this preliminary study, however it will be important to conduct further research with a larger sample size that incorporates post-lockdown and post-pandemic scores to ascertain whether trends seen here are in fact maintained when normal social contact resumes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",niAGhU

medical,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza remains a serious threat to human health. The consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. In addition to viral factors, the difference in host cellular response is likely to play a critical role. This study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host’s miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the miRNA microarray approach. RESULTS: The results showed that dysregulation of miRNA expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 infection. We found that miR-21*, miR-100*, miR-141, miR-574-3p, miR-1274a and miR1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza A virus infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that miR-141, which was more highly induced by H5N1 than by H1N1 (p < 0.05), had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine - transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2. This was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect could be reversed by antagomiR-141. CONCLUSIONS: Since TGF-β2 is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza H1N1 (but not the other avian influenza subtypes) could induce a persistent expression of TGF-β2, we speculate that the modulation of TGF-β2 expression by different influenza subtypes via miR-141 might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",S73Dql

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To report methods and findings of 2 autopsies with molecular evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive individuals. METHODS: Postmortem examination was completed following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidelines. Numerous formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue types from each case were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) from FFPE lung tissue blocks. RESULTS: Postmortem examinations revealed diffuse alveolar damage, while no viral-associated hepatic, cardiac, or renal damage was observed. Viral RNA was detected in lungs, bronchi, lymph nodes, and spleen in both cases using qRT-PCR method. RNA sequencing using NGS in case 1 revealed mutations most consistent with Western European Clade A2a with ORF1a L3606F mutation. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 testing and viral sequencing can be performed from FFPE tissue. Detection and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with morphological findings from postmortem tissue examination can aid in gaining a better understanding of the virus’s pathophysiologic effects on human health.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9_-2FM

Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion. Infusion of 140 μM A12 or AI before global ischemia improved cardiac function recovery; increased the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in reperfused heart; and reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical adduct of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide in the myocardial effluent during early reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Anesthetized open-chest rats were subjected to the left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Peptide A12 or its analog AI was injected intravenously at the onset of reperfusion at a dose of 0.35 μmol/kg. Treatment with A12 or AI significantly limited infarct size and reduced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in blood plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with control. These effects were accompanied by complete recovery of Cu,Zn SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities; and decrease in MDA content in the area at risk by the end of reperfusion. The study concluded that C-terminal fragment of native peptide apelin-12 and its synthesized analog is involved in the upregulation of cardiac antioxidant defense systems and attenuation of lipid peroxidation in myocardial I/R injury.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4-jUPg
medical,"Background In recent years, more than 120 million people each year have needed urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Armed conflict has profoundly negative consequences in communities. Destruction of civilian infrastructure impacts access to basic health services and complicates widespread emergency responses. The number of conflicts occurring is increasing, lasting longer and affecting more people today than a decade ago. The number of children living in conflict zones has been steadily increasing since the year 2000, increasing the need for health services and resources. This review systematically synthesised the indexed and grey literature reporting on the delivery of trauma and rehabilitation interventions for conflict-affected populations. Methods A systematic search of literature published from 1 January 1990 to 31 March 2018 was conducted across several databases. Eligible publications reported on women and children in low and middle-income countries. Included publications provided information on the delivery of interventions for trauma, sustained injuries or rehabilitation in conflict-affected populations. Results A total of 81 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were included in our review. Nearly all of the included publications were observational in nature, employing retrospective chart reviews of surgical procedures delivered in a hospital setting to conflict-affected individuals. The majority of publications reported injuries due to explosive devices and remnants of war. Injuries requiring orthopaedic/reconstructive surgeries were the most commonly reported interventions. Barriers to health services centred on the distance and availability from the site of injury to health facilities. Conclusions Traumatic injuries require an array of medical and surgical interventions, and their effective treatment largely depends on prompt and timely management and referral, with appropriate rehabilitation services and post-treatment follow-up. Further work to evaluate intervention delivery in this domain is needed, particularly among children given their specialised needs, and in different population displacement contexts.

medical,"Physical distancing policy that is encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) has inspired consumers to do contactless activities, including payment transaction. Government authorities in a growing number of countries are taking actions to encourage contactless payments as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates. People are worried that novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) can be transmitted through physical money. It drives them to shift to e-wallet. Due to a lack of study on this topic, the present study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of perceived risk, government support, and perceived usefulness on customers’ intention to use e-wallet during COVID-19 outbreak. To give more fruitful insight, another major contribution of this study is investigating the group difference between Indonesia and Malaysia in the overall model. Questionnaires are distributed to the respondents by using a proportional sampling technique. As a result, 259 total respondents from Indonesia and 207 from Malaysia are collected. Both countries are selected because Indonesia and Malaysia can be considered as the two-worst countries in ASEAN affected by COVID-19. The model is tested using PLS-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The results show that the effects of government support on the intention to use e-wallets differ between countries. Besides, perceived usefulness fully mediated government support-intention to use e-wallets relationship, and partially mediated the effect of perceived risk on intention to use e-wallets.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",I-TMwz

medical,"A limited number of drugs have been used for treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), all sharing the similar antiviral mechanism of inhibiting virus replication. This study investigates the anti-HCMV activities of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) from blocking virus entry and inhibiting virus spread. Recombinant human MBL was produced in CHO cells and native human MBL was isolated from human serum. A HCMV neutralization test was performed by pre-treating HCMV with each diluted MBL solution. Then the treated HCMV was inoculated onto the human embryonic pulmonary fibroblasts (HELF), which was followed by HCMV-DNA detection, PP65 positivity examination and confocal imaging of the infected cells. To test the activity of MBL in inhibiting viral spreading after viral invasion, HCMV growth inhibition test was performed. The infected cells were incubated with each diluted MBL, every 24 h, the supernatant was tested for HCMV-DNA. After 72 h, cells were collected for HCMV-DNA and PP65 examination. Then the cytopathic effect was observed and cell viability was measured at the 5 days after infection. HCMV neutralization test revealed 10 μg/mL MBL significantly decreased the HCMV invasion in HELF and the anti-HCMV activity can be blocked by 20 mg/mL mannan. HCMV growth inhibition test indicated that at 48 h after HCMV invasion, the HCMV-DNA level in the culture supernatant with 10 μg/mL MBL was lower than the control. After 72 h, both the HCMV-DNA levels and PP65 positivity in cells incubated with MBL were reduced.

In preclinical trials, the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against SARS-CoV-2 challenge was evaluated in a ferret model of infection. Groups of ferrets received either prime-only or prime-boost administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 via the intramuscular or intranasal route. All ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administration combinations resulted in significant reductions in viral loads in nasal-wash and oral swab samples. No vaccine-associated adverse events were observed associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 candidate, with the data from this study suggesting it could be an effective and safe vaccine against COVID-19.

medical,"My husband is 43 yrs old and has felt bad for close to 3 weeks now. He had elevated WBC about 10 days ago and they thought maybe sinus infxn & put him on Bactrim & prednisone . After a week his wbc was still 13. That may or may not be connected to the rest. He has had a distended abdomen to the point that at night when he s lying down he has a hard time breathing because he says he feels full . He also feels like his gut is swollen after he eats. He has had an almost 20lb weight gain in the past month. After 3 visits to MD and being told liver function tests were normal but cholesterol was high, we went to the ER. They said today his SGPT was 80 ( it was 31 last wed), also said that US & xrays did not show any fluid or anything else. Said they saw a CT from almost a yr ago that showed he had mild fatty liver & suspicious of NASH. No one ever told us that then. Today they said yes it s there but did not recheck to see if it was worse & said as stated above that his SGPT was way high and may need to be rechecked in a week or 2 and maybe see a GI but thats all they said they could do. He feels really rotten, dont have the energy to get out of bed for more than 10 minutes, has been that way for almost 3 weeks, and now feels like he cant even get any help. Any suggestions?

medical,"Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) response during attentional control in the context of task-irrelevant emotional faces is a promising biomarker of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outcome in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, it is unclear whether this biomarker extends to major depressive disorder (MDD) and is specific to CBT outcome. In the current study, 72 unmedicated patients with SAD (n = 39) or MDD (n = 33) completed a validated emotional interference paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging before treatment. Participants viewed letter strings superimposed on task-irrelevant threat and neutral faces under low perceptual load (high interference) and high perceptual load (low interference). Biomarkers comprised anatomy-based rostral ACC (rACC) and dorsal ACC (dACC) response to task-irrelevant threat (>neutral) faces under low and high perceptual load. Patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBT or supportive therapy (ST) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03175068). Clinician-administered measures of social anxiety and depression severity were obtained at baseline and every 2 weeks throughout treatment (7 assessments total) by an assessor blinded to the treatment arm. A composite symptom severity score was submitted to latent growth curve models. Results showed more baseline rACC activity to task-irrelevant threat>neutral faces under low, but not high, perceptual load predicted steeper trajectories of symptom improvement throughout CBT or ST. Post-hoc analyses indicated this effect was driven by subgenual ACC (sgACC) activation. Findings indicate ACC activity during attentional control may be a transdiagnostic neural predictor of general psychotherapy outcome.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FG1sNV
medical,"I have been experiencing lower right abdominal pain (pelvic area) for about the last three weeks. I ended up going to the ER two times where they have done lab work, scans, ultrasounds with no results. I have seen my primary dr who also had me go through testing. I had an upper GI and lower intestine test done and that showed nothing either. He sent me to a ob/gyn who I saw and he said it probably is bowel related or muscular. I had a 2nd opinion done with another ob/gyn and she thinks its also bowel related, so now I have followed up with my primary dr again who has now referred me to a GI dr who I see next week and will probably end up having a colonoscopy done. My gut feeling is it is not my bowels but rather a female issue because I had severe pain when I was in the ER and I was also spotting at that time.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Only one in four people with eating disorders seeks treatment, and of those who do seek treatment, 20% go on to experience a chronic course. Early intervention has been associated with better prognosis, with those seeking specialised intervention in the early stages of their illness more than twice as likely to achieve remission. Current screening measures typically require expert administration and are rarely validated across a spectrum of DSM-5 eating disorder presentations or for online use. In light of COVID-19 and increasing reliance on telehealth technologies in the intervention and delivery of mental health services, online assessments suitable for self-referral are likely to be the first step to seeking care. InsideOut Institute has developed a 6-item online screening tool for the purposes of identifying eating disorder risk and symptomatology, aimed specifically at increasing help-seeking behaviour in subsyndromal and early presentations. METHODS: This study investigates the reliability and validity of the InsideOut Institute Screener (IOI-S), using a cross-sectional survey research design. Participants aged 14 and over will complete an extensive baseline survey battery for evaluation. 50% of participants will be randomly selected for one follow-up re-test of the IOI-S only, 2 weeks post initial testing. The IOI-S will be analysed for statistical reliability on two parameters: internal consistency and test re-test reliability, and for statistical validity on four parameters: concurrent validity, sensitivity and specificity, convergent and discriminant validity. DISCUSSION: The rapid and ongoing shift to digital intervention has highlighted gaps and opportunities in our pathways to care. Adequate screening for eating disorders is a major gap. This study aims to validate an online screening tool for use in telehealth early intervention, designed for users seeking information for a suspected eating disorder. The screener meets those at risk ‘where they are’ (i.e. online) and may improve timely referrals to relevant services. This is of particular salience as face-to-face healthcare and traditional frontline interventions are disrupted, and we are challenged to re-design our practices to deliver diagnostic and treatment services in highly adaptive digital contexts.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",R-Jle2

We provide historical context of refugee resettlement, discuss challenges, and offer recommendations for healthcare providers to become more effective advocates for refugee health in the USA. The need is urgent for healthcare providers and institutions—particularly in regions of high resettlement—to advocate for expanding and assuring sustainable capacity to care for refugees. Key elements include promotion of trauma-informed care, integration of social services in primary care settings, partnership with community-based organizations to promote continuation of care, advocacy for resources and services, and opposition to policies detrimental to the health of refugees and immigrants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",q3n2_Q

Currently there is only limited evidence on the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women. CASE Here we present one of the first serious COVID-19 cases in pregnancy at term with subsequent delivery. Postpartum the mother required antibiotic and symptomatic treatment. She experienced acute worsening of symptoms and developed acute respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and subsequently extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSION COVID-19 affects all medical disciplines, requiring interdisciplinary approaches and development of patient care regimes. Obstetricians should be aware and be prepared for the special needs of pregnant women with potential prenatal and postnatal issues.
