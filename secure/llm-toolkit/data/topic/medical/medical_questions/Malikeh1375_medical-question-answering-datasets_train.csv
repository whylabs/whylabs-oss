medical,"A wide variety of social determinants of health have been associated with various risks and impacts on quality of life. Specifically, poverty, lack of insurance coverage, large household sizes, and social vulnerability are all factors implicated in incidence and mortality rates of infectious disease. However, no studies have examined the relationship of these factors to the COVID-19 pandemic on a state-wide level in Florida. Thereby, the objective of this study is to examine the relationship between average household size, poverty, uninsured populations, social vulnerability index (SVI), and rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Florida counties. The objective was accomplished by analyzing the cumulative case and death reports from state and local health departments in Florida. The data was compiled into a single dataset by the CDC COVID-19 Task Force. Using US Census Bureau data, all Florida counties were classified into tertiles of the separate categories of poverty rate, average household size, uninsured rates, and SVI (Social Vulnerability Index). The poverty level was classified as low (0-12.3%), moderate (12.3-17.3%), and high (>17.3% below the federal poverty line). The uninsured population proportion was classified as low (0-7.1%), moderate (7.1-11.4%), and high (>11.4% uninsured residents). Average county household size was classified as low (0-2.4), moderate (2.4-2.6), and high (>2.6). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) used US census data on 15 social determinants of vulnerability to evaluate and assist disadvantaged communities. SVI tertiles were low (0-0.333), moderate (0.334-0.666), and high (0.667-1) on a range of 0-1, with higher numbers signifying communities with many factors of social vulnerability. The mean cumulative cases and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated in each tertile for each category. Analysis of the data revealed that case and mortality rates due to COVID-19 in the high poverty counties were markedly higher in Florida than the national average. In contrast, moderate and low poverty rates were below average. Similarly, counties with a high SVI had case and mortality rates greatly above state and national averages. Counties with a high proportion of uninsured displayed the highest case rates. However, mortality rates were the highest in counties with a low proportion of uninsured individuals. No clear correlation was observed between COVID-19 rates and household size. It was concluded that compiled CDC and US census data suggests a significant correlation between poverty, social vulnerability, lack of insurance coverage, and increased incidence and mortality from COVID-19. Future research should statistically analyze the correlations and examine the individual factors of SVI as potential COVID-19 predictors.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KQyx_X

medical,"Airborne viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are partly spreading through aerosols containing viral particles. Inhalation of infectious airborne particles can lead to infection, a route that can even be more predominant compared with droplet or contact transmission. To study the transmission between a susceptible and an infected person, we estimate the distribution of arrival times of small diffusing aerosol particles to the inhaled region located below the nose until the number of particles reaches a critical threshold. Our results suggest that although contamination by continuous respiration can take around 90 minutes at a distance of one meter, it is reduced to a few minutes when coughing or sneezing. Interestingly, there is not much differences between outdoors and indoors when the air is still. When a window is open inside an office, the infection time is reduced. Finally, wearing a mask leads to a delay in the time to infection.

medical,"Importance: In March 2020, US public buildings (including schools) were shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 42% of US workers resumed their employment duties from home. Some shutdowns remain in place, yet the extent of the needs of US working parents is largely unknown. Objective: To identify and address the career development, work culture, and childcare needs of faculty, staff, and trainees at an academic medical center during a pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this survey study, between August 5 and August 20, 2020, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all faculty, staff, and trainees at University of Utah Health, an academic health care system that includes multiple hospitals, community clinics, and specialty centers. Participants included 27â¯700 University of Utah Health faculty, staff, and trainees who received a survey invitation. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included experiences of COVID-19 and their associations with career development, work culture, and childcare needs. Results: A total of 5030 participants completed the entire survey (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years); 3738 (75%) were women; 4306 (86%) were White or European American; 561 (11%) were Latino or Latina (of any race), Black or African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 301 (6%) were Asian or Asian American. Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic.

The trade war between the United States and China, along with the COVID-19 pandemic are two events that took place in the Chinese economy with the aforementioned characteristics of the Black swan phenomenon, to which this latest professional analysis is devoted. The objective of this research is to examine the response of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSEC) index, in addition to its relation with macroeconomic variables contributing towards a possible Black Swan Event. We employ an econometric methodology comprising of a unit root test, descriptive statistics, linear regression and correlation analysis for the period 2007-2019. Our results illustarte that the bubble from 2015, which is classified as a Black Swan event by many researchers, has a negative influence on the SSEC index. We can further deduce that there were some psychological effects on the Chinese stock market that lead to both, positive and negative trends of SSEC indices. The main findings confirmed that the Consumer Price Index, Exchange Rate, Interest Rate, Unemployment, GDP and Trade Balance were significantly elaborative macroeconomic variables, that had a substantial impact on the SSEC index.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",w_X84d

medical,"The consequences of poverty, current technological innovation (the change of the nature of work) for the labour market and overall societal transformation strengthened the interest of governments, intergovernmental policy-making bodies and international experts in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control”. The article alludes to a universal basic income/unconditional basic income (UBI)—a kind of cash welfare programme in which all citizens (or permanent residents) of a country receive a regular, liveable and unconditional amount of money from the government. Governments recommitted themselves to ensuring decent work and social protection for all through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Article 25 has never been implemented globally through appropriate government interventions and redistributive measures. Such measures are and have been pursued on a trial basis as evidenced by country experiences contained in this chapter. This could eventually open the door to a global basic income elsewhere in the world, framed on the specific needs and conditions of countries. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) likewise could explore whether such an unconditional income yields returns in terms of Inclusive Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) within the framework of possible income and employment effects of UBI triggered by technical assistance and business support services. Such an endeavour would take UBI beyond its monetary threshold and make it a potential source of sustainable livelihoods for social wellbeing and income creation. In these unprecedented times, citizens in almost every country will face an uphill battle to address their socio-economic basic needs. The insecurity and great uncertainties caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and beyond, especially among the poor and small-scale businesses and subsistence farmers, will compel governments and UN agencies to develop new strategies.

medical,"The significance of the pharmaceutical and commercial sectors in the national economy has noticeably intensified, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective of this study was to gain a better insight into the main management characteristics of the actors in the sector. It was assumed that more efficient management of financial investments (acquisitions, loans) caused higher risk financial investment decisions in the pharmaceutical industry in order to place companies in a better position in view of equity investors, illustrated best as the profitability of equity (ROE). This paper examined one possible means of covering the extremely high indirect costs (R&D, marketing) of pharmaceutical companies, also justified by the restructuring of the industry and the effect of investments in long term financial instruments on the ROE of the same business entities. Built on the EMIS database, the analysis only used the indicators of those companies operating in the pharmaceutical industry in Visegrad countries for 2019. The authors sought to draw conclusions about possible management characteristics of the entire pharmaceutical sector of these countries using cluster analysis and linear regression. The initial assumption, or main hypothesis of the study, was that in one of the countries studied or for those businesses operating above a certain revenue category, the impact of a company’s risk-taking (which can also be expressed in terms of asset-based financial income) on profitability, may appear or intensify. The performed studies did not show a strong correlation between the explanatory and profit variables either at the national level or at the level of groups formed by regional market position. In other words, the extremely high level of indirect costs were mostly covered by sales of successful cash products, and companies not indebted to suppliers undertook significant risks in the field of financial investments, thereby offsetting the positive impact of the latter on earnings.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OgcETP

medical,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate rates of antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among kidney transplant recipients, and to identify factors associated with reduced immunogenicity. METHODS: A prospective cohort study including consecutive kidney transplant recipients in a single referral transplant center. Participants were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies 2-4 weeks following second vaccine dose. Primary outcome was rate of seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titer was 15.5 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] 1.025 per ml/min/1.73m(2), 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.014 - 1.037, p<0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95% CI 1.782 - 3.089, p<0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95% CI 1.015 - 1.05, p<0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95% CI 1.146 - 3.443, p=0.014). No serious adverse events to the vaccine were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients demonstrated inadequate antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Immunosuppression level was a significant factor in this response. Strategies to improve immunogenicity should be examined in future studies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Tv4Ngd

His urine toxicology screening was negative for illicit substances and after careful evaluation and additional history, provided by his parents, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was treated with aripiprazole. His symptoms did not improve after several dosage adjustments and he was placed on haloperidol, but this left him too lethargic and slow and he was placed on loxapine. After several dosage adjustments today, he is still quite confused. He describes giant spiders and robots that torture him in his room. He describes an incessant voice screaming at him to run away.

medical,"Microbiome composition data collected through amplicon sequencing are count data on taxa in which the total count per sample (the library size) is an artefact of the sequencing platform and as a result such data are compositional. To avoid library size dependency, one common way of analyzing multivariate compositional data is to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on data transformed with the centered log-ratio, hereafter called a log-ratio PCA. Two aspects typical of amplicon sequencing data are the large differences in library size and the large number of zeroes. In this paper we show on real data and by simulation that, applied to data that combines these two aspects, log-ratio PCA is nevertheless heavily dependent on the library size. This leads to a reduction in power when testing against any explanatory variable in log-ratio redundancy analysis. If there is additionally a correlation between the library size and the explanatory variable, then the type 1 error becomes inated.

medical,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae, contains a polyadenylated positive-sense single-stranded genomic RNA which is 31 kb long. MHV replication and transcription take place via the synthesis of negative-strand RNA intermediates from a positive-strand genomic template. A cis-acting element previously identified in the 3' untranslated region binds to trans-acting host factors from mouse fibroblasts and forms at least three RNA-protein complexes. The largest RNA-protein complex formed by the cis-acting element and the lysate from uninfected mouse fibroblasts has a molecular weight of about 200 kDa. The complex observed in gel shift assays has been resolved by second-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four proteins of approximately 90, 70, 58, and 40 kDa after RNase treatment. Specific RNA affinity chromatography also has revealed the presence of a 90-kDa protein associated with RNA containing the cis-acting element bound to magnetic beads. The 90-kDa protein has been purified from uninfected mouse fibroblast crude lysates. Protein microsequencing identified the 90-kDa protein as mitochondrial aconitase. Antibody raised against purified mitochondrial aconitase recognizes the RNA-protein complex and the 90-kDa protein, which can be released from the complex by RNase digestion. Furthermore, UV cross-linking studies indicate that highly purified mitochondrial aconitase binds specifically to the MHV 3' protein-binding element. Increasing the intracellular level of mitochondrial aconitase by iron supplementation resulted in increased RNA-binding activity in cell extracts and increased virus production as well as viral protein synthesis at early hours of infection. These results are particularly interesting in terms of identification of an RNA target for mitochondrial aconitase, which has a cytoplasmic homolog, cytoplasmic aconitase, also known as iron regulatory protein 1, a well-recognized RNA-binding protein. The binding properties of mitochondrial aconitase and the functional relevance of RNA binding appear to parallel those of cytoplasmic aconitase.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LzOXg2

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 provided the impetus for unprecedented adoption of telemedicine. This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS: This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS: During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",SmJyM3

medical,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic researchers looked for evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in feces dissolved in wastewater samples to assess levels of infection across communities. This activity is known colloquially as sewer monitoring and called wastewater-based epidemiology in academic settings. When used for public health surveillance in the United States, wastewater monitoring is not regulated, although general ethical principles have been described. Prior to this study, no nationwide data existed regarding the public's perceptions of wastewater being used for community health monitoring. Using an online survey distributed to a representative sample of adults in the Unites States (N=3,083), we investigated the public's perceptions regarding what is monitored, where monitoring occurs, and privacy concerns related to wastewater monitoring as a public health surveillance tool. Further, the Privacy Attitudes Questionnaire assessed respondents' general privacy boundaries. The results suggest that respondents supported using wastewater for health monitoring, but within some bounds. Participants were most likely to support or strongly support monitoring for disease (95%), environmental toxins (94%), and terroristic threats (90%, e.g., anthrax). Two-thirds of respondents endorsed no prohibition to locations being monitored while the most common category of location respondents wanted to be prohibited from monitoring was personal residencies. Additionally, the findings suggest that those younger in age and living in an urban area were more supportive of wastewater monitoring, compared to older, suburban dwellers.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Gprsyg

medical,"Inflammation is an obligatory marker of arterial disease, both stemming from the inflammatory activity of cholesterol itself and from well-established molecular mechanisms. Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the anti-inflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27% reduction of hsCRP. The inflammation-based approach to arterial disease has considerably gained from an improved understanding of the clinical diagnostic strategy and from a better knowledge on the mode of action of numerous agents, including nutraceuticals.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",D6FfRR

We also aimed to explore clinical and radiological predictors of pulmonary fibrosis following COVID-19. METHODS: Two hundred and 20 consecutive patients were evaluated at 3–6 months after discharge with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and categorized as recovered (REC) or not recovered (NOT-REC). Both HRCTs at hospitalization (HRCT(0)), when available, and HRCT(1) during follow-up were analyzed semiquantitatively as follows: ground-glass opacities (alveolar score, AS), consolidations (CONS), and reticulations (interstitial score, IS). RESULTS: A total of 175/220 (80%) patients showed disease resolution at their initial radiological evaluation following discharge. NOT-REC patients (45/220; 20%) were mostly older men [66 (35–85) years vs. 56 (19–87); p = 0.03] with a longer in-hospital stay [16 (0–75) vs. 8 (1–52) days; p < 0.0001], and lower P/F at admission [233 (40–424) vs. 318 (33–543); p = 0.04]. Moreover, NOT-REC patients presented, at hospital admission, higher ALV [14 (0.0–62.0) vs. 4.4 (0.0–44.0); p = 0.0005], CONS [1.9 (0.0–26.0) vs. 0.4 (0.0–18.0); p = 0.0064], and IS [11.5 (0.0– 29.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0–22.0); p < 0.0001] compared to REC patients. On multivariate analysis, the presence of CONS and IS at HRCT(0) was independent predictors of radiological sequelae at follow-up [OR 14.87 (95% CI: 1.25–175.8; p = 0.03) and 28.9 (95% CI: 2.17–386.6; p = 0.01, respectively)]. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, only twenty percent of patients showed persistent lung abnormalities at 6 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. These patients are predominantly older men with longer hospital stay. The presence of reticulations and consolidation on HRCT at hospital admission predicts the persistence of radiological abnormalities during follow-up.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EFFCar

medical,"Hello, A few months ago, I keep smelling a moldy smell in the air (in my room) and its really bothering me, Ive began to sneeze a lot, my nose is always runny in one and stuffy in the other. After some time, Ive finally located on the back of a piece of furniture, there were tiny, hairy black spots growing all over the surface area. Ive cleaned everything with bleach and sanitize everything and I stopped smelling the moldy smell. However, for past two-weeks, I keep smelling a strong pungent urine smell everywhere, especially at night as I lay in bed before falling asleep. During the day the smell is more faint and doesnt last as long. But at night it seems like my bed was once soaked in a pool of urine but is now dry; when I smell every surface area of the bed, it smells like clean linen but the urine smell just floats in the air. Dreadful as it sounds, I actually get down on the carpet and sniff for the smell and I find nothing. I own a small dog for almost three years now, he is house-trained and only goes outside or in a designated area in the house (we trained him to use a litter box.) I checked the carpet area around his litter box and there are no urine smell either. When it smells so bad and someone is home with me, I ask if they smell it too but no one never smell anything. I have had migraine headaches for years and when the pungent smell lingers for too long it triggers my migraine. Every day for two-weeks now, I would wake up with a runny nose and sneezing for the first 30-45 mins.

medical," Migraine Definition The pain of a migraine headache is often described as an intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head. However, it is much more; the International Headache Society diagnoses a migraine by its pain and number of attacks (at least 5, lasting 4-72 hours if untreated), and additional symptoms including nausea and/or vomiting, or sensitivity to both light and sound. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men and affects more than 10 percent of people worldwide. Roughly one-third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an ""aura,"" visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision. People with migraine tend to have recurring attacks triggered by a number of different factors, including stress, anxiety, hormonal changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep, and dietary substances. Migraine in some women may relate to changes in hormones and hormonal levels during their menstrual cycle. For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the dilation and constriction of blood vessels in the head. Investigators now believe that migraine has a genetic cause. Treatment There is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood. There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. Prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes. Drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine. Behaviorally, stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, biofeedback mechanisms, and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort, may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks. Making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes, including dietary considerations, eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration, stopping certain medications, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine. Relief of symptoms, or acute treatments, during attacks consists of sumatriptan, ergotamine drugs, and analgesics such as ibuprofen and aspirin. The sooner these treatments are administered, the more effective they are. Prognosis Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important. Evidence shows an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals With proper combination of drugs for prevention and treatment of migraine attacks most individuals can overcome much of the discomfort from this debilitating disorder. Women whose migraine attacks occur in association with their menstrual cycle are likely to have fewer attacks and milder symptoms after menopause.

medical,"Network structures have attracted much interest and have been rigorously studied in the past two decades. Researchers used many mathematical tools to represent these networks, and in recent days, hypergraphs play a vital role in this analysis. This paper presents an efficient technique to find the influential nodes using centrality measure of weighted directed hypergraph. Genetic Algorithm is exploited for tuning the weights of the node in the weighted directed hypergraph through which the characterization of the strength of the nodes, such as strong and weak ties by statistical measurements (mean, standard deviation, and quartiles) is identified effectively. Also, the proposed work is applied to various biological networks for identification of influential nodes and results shows the prominence the work over the existing measures. Furthermore, the technique has been applied to COVID-19 viral protein interactions. The proposed algorithm identified some critical human proteins that belong to the enzymes TMPRSS2, ACE2, and AT-II, which have a considerable role in hosting COVID-19 viral proteins and causes for various types of diseases. Hence these proteins can be targeted in drug design for an effective therapeutic against COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Cnbrim
medical,"The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and bone mineral density (BMD) is poorly elucidated and has contradictory findings. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) for other indications can provide a valuable opportunity for osteoporosis screening. Thus, we retrospectively explored the association between OSA and BMD by examining abdominal CT vertebrae images for a multitude of conditions and indications. We included 315 subjects (174 with OSA and 141 without OSA) who performed at least two CT scans (under similar settings). Both groups had a similar duration between the first and second CT scans of 3.6 years. BMD decreased in those with OSA and increased age. A multivariate linear regression indicated that OSA is associated with BMD alterations after controlling for age, gender, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, we report that OSA is associated with BMD alterations. Further studies are required to untangle the complex affect of OSA on BMD and the possible clinical implications of vertebra-depressed or femoral neck fractures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7as2gU

medical,"This paper explores the pipeline of new and upcoming vaccines as it relates to monitoring their safety. Compared with most currently available vaccines, that are constituted of live attenuated organisms or inactive products, future vaccines will also be based on new technologies. Several products that include such technologies are either already licensed or at an advanced stage of clinical development. Those include viral vectors, genetically attenuated live organisms, nucleic acid vaccines, novel adjuvants, increased number of antigens present in a single vaccine, novel mode of vaccine administration and thermostabilisation. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors novel vaccines, from the time they become available for large scale use. GACVS maintains their safety profile as evidence emerges from post-licensure surveillance and observational studies. Vaccines and vaccine formulations produced with novel technologies will have different safety profiles that will require adapting pharmacovigilance approaches. For example, GACVS now considers viral vector templates developed on the model proposed by Brighton Collaboration. The characteristics of those novel products will also have implications for the risk management plans (RMPs). Questions related to the duration of active monitoring for genetic material, presence of adventitious agents more easily detected with enhanced biological screening, or physiological mechanisms of novel adjuvants are all considerations that will belong to the preparation of RMPs. In addition to assessing those novel products and advising experts, GACVS will also consider how to more broadly communicate about risk assessment, so vaccine users can also benefit from the committee’s advice.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",iTMwOd

medical,"Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

medical,"In today’s competitive business environment, the cost of a product is one of the most important considerations for its sale. Businesses are heavily involved in research strategies to minimize the cost of elements that can impact on the final price of the product. Logistics is one such factor. Numerous products arrive from diverse locations to consumers in today’s digital era of online businesses. Clearly, the logistics sector faces several dilemmas from order attributes to environmental changes in this regard. This has specially been noted during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic where the demands on online businesses have increased several fold. Consequently, the methodology to optimise delivery cost and its impact on environmental focus by reducing CO2 emissions has gained relevance. The resultant strategy of Shipment Consolidation that has evolved is an approach that combines one or more transport orders in the same vehicle for delivery. Shipment Consolidation has been categorized in three order scheduling approaches: Time based consolidation, Quantity based consolidation, and a Hybrid (Time-Quantity) based consolidation. In this paper, a new Hybrid Consolidation approach is presented. Using the Hybrid approach, it has been shown that order delivery can be facilitated by taking into account not only the order pick up time, but also the total order quantity. These results have shown that if a time window is available in respect of the order delivery time, then the order can be delayed from pickup to consolidate it with other orders for cost optimization. This hybrid approach is based on four consolidation principles, two of which work on fixed departure and two, on demand departure. Three of these rules have been implemented and tested here with an application case study. Statistical analysis of the results is illustrated with different planning evaluation indicators. The Result analyses indicate that consolidation of orders is increased with each implemented rule hence motivating us towards the implementation of the fourth rule. Testing with bigger data sets is required. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xzqa33

medical,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Healthcare professionals are particularly susceptible to this occupational phenomenon. There is limited literature currently published addressing burnout in the context of the Irish frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to determine the rate and degree of burnout present in the emergency department (ED) staff at St. James hospital Dublin (SJH) and at Cork University Hospital (CUH), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed on a convenience sample of medical staff and healthcare staff in the ED at Cork University Hospital and St. James Hospital Dublin, two major University Hospital EDs. Burnout was measured using the Oldenburg burnout inventory (OLBI) a standardised 16-question instrument. Participants also provided demographic data and answered several questions relating to the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine participants across two departments responded (a response rate of 30%). All ED cohorts were represented. RESULTS: Burnout was identified in almost three quarters of respondents (74%). The mean burnout scores were 2.42 (OLBI cut-off 2.18). There was mean disengagement level of 2.25 and a mean exhaustion level of 2.59. There was no statistically significant variance between staff, by demographics (i.e. occupation, years working in the ED, age, or gender). There was no significant difference in burnout rates or scores between St. James Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital, though the former tended to have a higher rate of burnout at 81% vs the 67% burnout observed in CUH. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to the long-established problem of health care burnout. The trajectory of this disease is still unclear. Consistent, progressive measures to address staff well-being, and support frontline workers, are imperative going forward.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ju4bSu

medical,"BACKGROUND: To date, no recommendations have been published on when and how to start again carrying out elective, non-urgent surgery on COVID-19-negative patients after the epidemic peak has been reached in a given country or region and the pressure on healthcare facilities, healthcare workers and resources has been released by so far that elective surgery procedures can be safely and ethically programmed again. This study aims to investigate whether elective orthopaedic surgery will increase the risk of developing COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a combined retrospective and prospective studies performed at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgeries at our institution from April to May 2020. Those who were previously infected with COVID-19 from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reverse transcriptase (RT) examination obtained via nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, as well as those who were reluctant to participate were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 35 subjects (mean age 32.89 ± 17.42) were recruited. Fifteen (42.9%) subjects were male, and 20 subjects (57.1%) were female. Mean duration of surgery was 240 min with the longest and shortest duration of 690 and 40 min, respectively. General anaesthesia was performed in the majority of cases in 18 surgeries (51.4%) with local anaesthesia as the least in 2 surgeries (5.7%). Length of stay of our study was 6 days of average. None of the patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We found that elective orthopaedic surgery may not be associated with increased cases of COVID-19 cases. However, our study was limited by short duration of follow-up. Further studies are required in order to investigate the affect of undergoing elective surgery and the number of COVID-19 cases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EZWCNg

medical,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how obtaining a medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling versus traditional in-clinic care impacted participants' access to care. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who completed a medication abortion by mail through the TelAbortion study. We asked participants how they learned about telemedicine abortion, reasons for choosing it, what their alternative would have been, and about their experience. We transcribed, coded, and performed qualitative content analysis of the interviews and are presenting a subset of themes related to access to care when the restrictions on clinic dispensing of mifepristone are removed. RESULTS: We interviewed 45 people from January to July 2020. Direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion was more convenient and accessible than in-clinic abortion care when considering the burdens of travel, clinic availability, logistics, and cost that were associated with in-clinic abortion. Stigma led to a prioritization of privacy, and by going to a clinic, participants feared a loss of privacy whereas obtaining a medication abortion by mail made it easier to maintain confidentiality. Faced with these barriers, 13% of participants stated they would have continued their pregnancy if TelAbortion had not been an option. Participants found direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be acceptable and recommended it to others. Benefits of telemedicine were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns around infection exposure with in-clinic care. CONCLUSION: Going to a clinic was a burden for participants, to the point where some would not have otherwise been able to get an abortion. Medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling was a highly acceptable alternative. IMPLICATIONS: Medication abortion by mail can increase access to abortion with the added benefits of increased perceived privacy and decreased logistical burdens. Removing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone would allow direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be implemented outside of a research setting without compromising the patient experience.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",i7Pibk
medical,"BACKGROUND: Epidemic COVID-19 in 2020 was one of the crises that confronted the Islamic Republic of Iran's health system as a developing low-income country with many challenges. The purpose of this study is to explain the requirements of similar health systems in facing epidemics such as COVID-19 as well as sharing experiences of Iran. METHODS: The present study was a qualitative study using content analysis of the Iranian Ministry of Health website (behdasht.gov.ir) during the official onset of COVID-19 in Iran (February 20) to March 7, 2020. To Integrate data, interviews with experts were used. In this regard, 4 national health policymakers and 5 provincial health managers were interviewed. After implementation using 8-step content analysis method, data were analyzed using MAXQDA software by research team members who had no conflict of interest. RESULTS: The findings show that the disease began on February 20, 2020, with two cases of death from COVID-19 in Qom province in central Iran and within two weeks it has widely affected 31 provinces, with 4747 approved cases and 124 deaths. According to the results, the Islamic Republic of Iran's health system faced five major challenges to confronting with COVID-19: 1- Medical consumables supply 2- Hospital beds allocation and intensive care units (ICU) equipment 3-The lack of a comprehensive COVID-19 protocol in the country 4- the lack of a single command authority to deal with the crisis 5- Insufficient public health literacy and information as a result of social anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of this case indicate that health systems require policy action to prevent and control diseases rather than other implementations. In this regard, training should be given to children and adolescents, at-risk persons and health system staff. In addition, to confront with COVID-19, an integrated policy implementation team should be established in collaboration with the health sector and other relevant bodies. KEY MESSAGES: It seems obvious that policy implementation requires to prepare the country for future contingencies.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: (Background) The role of pharmacists revolves around providing the highest levels of care to society and ensuring the provision of medicine to all patients. However, with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), pharmacists as a very important part of healthcare professionals’ team are responsible for fighting against the disease regardless of their setting of practice. The role of pharmacists will undergo a little change to extend and include other roles in order to ensure the safety of the community and limit the virus spread. Also, they will be required to obtain information from reliable sources, and to be up to date, so they can be reliable advisors to the community and raise their awareness. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to highlight community and hospital pharmacists’ roles during (COVID-19) global pandemic, and to clearly illustrate how they are contributing to maintain pharmacy services continuity, supporting other healthcare professionals, and facilitating the patient’s education. SUMMARY: Clinical pharmacists provide direct patient care through monitoring adverse drug reactions, ensuring individualized treatment, performing evidence-based practice, and evaluating drugs in clinical trials. On the other hand, community pharmacists which are the most accessible healthcare providers by the community increase their awareness regarding the preventive measures, balance medicines supply and demand, provide drive-thru and home delivery services, offer telehealth counselling, psychological support, refer suspected COVID-19 patients, and provide vaccination when available. CONCLUSION: Innovative pharmacists’ roles have emerged to adapt to changes during COVID-19 pandemic, however, they may be needed in the post COVID-19 world as well.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",G9B4P6

medical,"Many tasks performed by swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles require localization. In many cases, the sensors that take part in the localization process suffer from inherent measurement errors. This problem is amplified when disruptions are added, either endogenously through Byzantine failures of agents within the swarm, or exogenously by some external source, such as a GNSS jammer. In this paper, we first introduce an improved localization method based on distance observation. Then, we devise schemes for detecting Byzantine agents, in scenarios of endogenous disruptions, and for detecting a disrupted area, in case the source of the problem is exogenous. Finally, we apply pool testing techniques to reduce the communication traffic and the computation time of our schemes. The optimal pool size should be chosen carefully, as very small or very large pools may impair the ability to identify the source/s of disruption. A set of simulated experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which enable reliable error estimation even amid disruptions.

As of 1st January 2021, India has recorded 10,305,788 cases and 149,218 deaths from this deadly pandemic. It has been observed through the data;across states and UTs, the trend and pattern of this disease are not similar at all. There are many reasons for these dissimilarities which are categorized into indicators to assess the vulnerability in this study. We have examined vulnerabilities in 28 states and 8 UTs of India. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) has been applied with certain modifications to calculate the Vulnerability Index ( VI). The figure resulting from the vulnerability assessment corresponds that the factors involved in the three-section exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity had a significant impact on deciding the vulnerability of the population. The result identified the states and UTs which are more vulnerable and need more attention from the government and policymakers. The proposed method of study is unique in its sense as vulnerability index calculation is purely based on a secondary source of data and therefore has an expectation of a higher degree of practical application. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

medical,"Baculovirus expression vectors are successfully used for the commercial production of complex (glyco)proteins in eukaryotic cells. The genome engineering of single-copy baculovirus infectious clones (bacmids) in E. coli has been valuable in the study of baculovirus biology, but bacmids are not yet widely applied as expression vectors. An important limitation of first-generation bacmids for large-scale protein production is the rapid loss of gene of interest (GOI) expression. The instability is caused by the mini-F replicon in the bacmid backbone, which is non-essential for baculovirus replication in insect cells, and carries the adjacent GOI in between attTn7 transposition sites. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that relocation of the attTn7 transgene insertion site away from the mini-F replicon prevents deletion of the GOI, thereby resulting in higher and prolonged recombinant protein expression levels. We applied lambda red genome engineering combined with SacB counterselection to generate a series of bacmids with relocated attTn7 sites and tested their performance by comparing the relative expression levels of different GOIs. We conclude that GOI expression from the odv-e56 (pif-5) locus results in higher overall expression levels and is more stable over serial passages compared to the original bacmid. Finally, we evaluated this improved next-generation bacmid during a bioreactor scale-up of Sf9 insect cells in suspension to produce enveloped chikungunya virus-like particles as a model vaccine.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GXbavJ

medical,"Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, a large number of genomes have been sequenced with unprecedented speed around the world. This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. However, currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We proposed an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Thus, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the global temporal and geographic haplotypes distribution in the world. Using 48 776 genomes, we identify 5 major haplotypes based on 9 high-frequency mutations. Normalized global geographic and temporal analysis is presented here highlighting the current importance of nucleocapsid mutations (R203K, G204R) above the highly discussed D614G in spike protein. Also, we analyzed age, gender, and patient status distribution by haplotypes, but scarce and not well-organized information about this is publicly available. For that, we create a web-service to continuously update our normalized analysis of mutations and haplotypes, and to allow researchers to voluntarily share patient status information in a well-organized manner to improve analyses and making possible monitor the emergence of mutations and/or haplotypes with patients preferences or different pathogenic features. Finally, we discuss currently structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7J56vc

medical,"Assays using ELISA measurements on serially diluted serum samples have been heavily used to measure serum reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and are widely used in virology and elsewhere in biology. We test a method using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to reduce the workload of these assays and measure reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens to human serum samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflection titers for SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (S1S2), spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleoprotein (N) inferred from 3 spread-out dilutions correlated with those inferred from 8 consecutive dilutions with an R(2) value of 0.97 or higher. We confirm existing findings showing a small proportion of pre-pandemic human serum samples contain cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 and N, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum reactivity to the beta-HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 S1S2. In serial dilution assays, large savings in resources and/or increases in throughput can be achieved by reducing the number of dilutions measured and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to infer inflection or endpoint titers.

medical,"The advent and persistence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus – 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic since December 2019 has created the largest public health emergency in over a century. Despite the administration of multiple vaccines across the globe, there continues to be a lack of approved efficacious non-prophylactic interventions for the disease. Flavonoids are a class of phytochemicals with historically established antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that are effective against cancers, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and even other human coronaviruses. To identify the most promising bioactive flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2, this article screened a virtual library of 46 bioactive flavonoids against three promising targets in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle: human TMPRSS2 protein, 3CLpro, and PLpro. By examining the effects of glycosylation and other structural-activity relationships, the presence of sugar moiety in flavonoids significantly reduces its binding energy. It increases the solubility of flavonoids leading to reduced toxicity and higher bioavailability. Through protein-ligand contact profiling, it was concluded that naringin formed more hydrogen bonds with TMPRSS2 and 3CLpro. In contrast, hesperidin formed a more significant number of hydrogen bonds with PLpro. These observations were complimented by the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis, which showed a considerable stability of docked bioflavonoids in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. Finally, the binding affinity and stability of the selected docked complexes were compared with the reference ligands (camostat for TMPRSS2, GC376 for 3CLpro, and GRL0617 for PLpro) that strongly inhibit their respective SARS-COV-2 targets. Overall analysis revealed that the selected flavonoids could be potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Naringin showed better affinity and stability for TMPRSS2 and 3CLpro, whereas hesperidin showed a better binding relationship and stability for PLpro.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-Zi1ts

medical,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all schools in Poland were closed and obliged to conduct lessons remotely. The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",F91AWA

Our aims were to evaluate the presence of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients and to assess the frequency of pancreatic hyperenzymemia. METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 110 consecutive patients (69 males, 41 females; mean age, 63.0 years; range, 24-93 years) met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and serum activity of pancreatic amylase and lipase were assayed in all patients using commercially available kits. RESULTS: None of the patients studied developed clinical signs or morphological alterations compatible with acute pancreatitis. However, it was found that 24.5% of the patients had amylase values above 53 IU/L and 16.4% had lipase values above 300 IU/L. Only 1 patient (0.9%) had both amylase and lipase values in excess of 3-fold the upper normal limit without clinical signs of pancreatitis.

medical,"Neurodegenerative diseases, for example Alzheimer’s, are perceived as driven by hereditary, cellular, and multifaceted biochemical actions. Numerous plant products, for example flavonoids, are documented in studies for having the ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and moderate the development of such illnesses. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has achieved importance in the drug discovery world; innovative developments in the aspects of structure identification and characterization, bio-computational science, and molecular biology have added to the preparation of new medications towards these ailments. In this study we evaluated nine flavonoid compounds identified from three medicinal plants, namely T. diversifolia, B. sapida, and I. gabonensis for their inhibitory role on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, using pharmacophore modeling, auto-QSAR prediction, and molecular studies, in comparison with standard drugs. The results indicated that the pharmacophore models produced from structures of AChE, BChE and MAO could identify the active compounds, with a recuperation rate of the actives found near 100% in the complete ranked decoy database. Moreso, the robustness of the virtual screening method was accessed by well-established methods including enrichment factor (EF), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Boltzmann-enhanced discrimination of receiver operating characteristic (BEDROC), and area under accumulation curve (AUAC). Most notably, the compounds’ pIC(50) values were predicted by a machine learning-based model generated by the AutoQSAR algorithm. The generated model was validated to affirm its predictive model. The best models achieved for AChE, BChE and MAO were models kpls_radial_17 (R(2) = 0.86 and Q(2) = 0.73), pls_38 (R(2) = 0.77 and Q(2) = 0.72), kpls_desc_44 (R(2) = 0.81 and Q(2) = 0.81) and these externally validated models were utilized to predict the bioactivities of the lead compounds. The binding affinity results of the ligands against the three selected targets revealed that luteolin displayed the highest affinity score of −9.60 kcal/mol, closely followed by apigenin and ellagic acid with docking scores of −9.60 and −9.53 kcal/mol, respectively. The least binding affinity was attained by gallic acid (−6.30 kcal/mol). The docking scores of our standards were −10.40 and −7.93 kcal/mol for donepezil and galanthamine, respectively. The toxicity prediction revealed that none of the flavonoids presented toxicity and they all had good absorption parameters for the analyzed targets.

To assess the antiviral potential of an ectopic expression of the nectin-1 ectodomain in vivo, six transgenic mouse lines expressing a soluble form of nectin-1, consisting of an extracellular domain of porcine nectin-1 and the Fc portion of human IgG1, were generated. All of the transgenic mouse lines showed nearly complete resistance to PRV infection by means of both i.p. and intranasal routes.

medical,"Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements   - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours   - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement   - Itching or irritation around the anus   - A visible crack in the skin around the anus   - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools   - Constipation and straining during bowel movements   - Chronic diarrhea   - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease   - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer   - HIV   - Tuberculosis   - Syphilis   - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why.   - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area.   - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.   - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.   - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.   - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment.   - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one.   - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BkSOC7

The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rq_D2t

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only the emergency medical system, but also patients' regular ambulatory care, as such decrease in the number of patients visiting outpatient clinics decreased in 2020 than in 2019, or the ban lifting of subsequent visits by telephone for outpatient clinics since March 2020 in lieu of ambulatory care for chronic diseases. In this context, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory care at Japanese outpatient clinics for patients with chronic neurological diseases during 2020. We collected data from the administrative claims database (DeSC database) covering more than 1 million individuals. Serial changes in the frequency of subsequent outpatient visits to clinics or hospitals (excluding large hospitals) for chronic ambulatory care of epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 2020 were measured. As a result, since April 2020, the monthly outpatient visits for epilepsy, PD, and AD decreased slightly but significantly (approximately 0.90 in relative risk [RR]) but visits for migraine increased (RR = 1.15). Telephone visit was most frequently used in April-May, in less than 5% of monthly outpatient clinic visits for the examined neurological diseases. Outpatient visits for migraine treatment were more likely to be done by telephone than in case of other diseases (adjusted Odds ratio = 2.08). These results suggest that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on regular ambulatory care for several chronic neurological diseases yielded different effect depending on the disease, in terms of the frequency or type of outpatient visits.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",26orBu

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Due to their stressful lives, Palestinian refugees are prone to use cognitive enhancers (CE) and psychostimulant substances (PS). Recognising health problems associated with CE/PS use can indicate how preventive programs should be directed towards adolescents. Unfortunately, research has not thoroughly investigated the health problems related to tobacco and caffeine products, the most socially acceptable CE/PS among Palestinian refugee adolescents. METHODOLOGY: In 2021, schoolchildren from five Palestinian refugee camps (N=271) aged 12-<16 years agreed to give blood samples and to be interviewed to address the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and tobacco smoking, coffee, energy drinks (ED), black tea, and chocolate consumption. MetS was diagnosed based on International Diabetic Federation Criteria. To address the association, we used binary logistic regression models adjusted to age, gender, BMI, and central obesity. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was [17 (6.3%)]; (7.4%) in males, (5.1%) in females. The prevalence of substance use was as follows: ED [163 (48.9%)], coffee [255 (76.6%)], black tea [295 (89.1%)], cigarette [35 (10.5%)], waterpipe [59 (17.7%)], and chocolate [309 (93.6%)], with male predominance. Cigarette smokers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.024), and decreased HDL-cholesterol (p-value=0.015) than non-smokers. Similar results were observed for waterpipe smokers besides the increased levels of triglycerides (p-value=0.01). ED consumers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.03) and fast blood sugar (p-value=0.003) than non-consumers. Chocolate consumers have decreased central obesity (p-value=0.008) and increased HDL levels (p-value=0.04) than non-consumers. ED consumers were significantly at higher risk of MetS (OR=9.97, p-value=0.019) than non-consumers and chocolate consumers were at lower risk of MetS (OR=0.14, p-value=0.046) than non-consumers. Waterpipe smokers were at a higher risk of having increased plasma triglycerides than non-consumers (OR=3.4, p-value=0.03). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of ED consumption and waterpipe smoking in Palestinian refugee adolescents is problematic. Their use was associated with higher odds of MetS, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, which justifies greater attention.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FdVG6H

medical,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms have been investigated in several studies. Most of these studies focused on specific aneurysms or a certain WEB device. Our objective was to report the experience of 2 German centers with the WEB device, including technical feasibility, safety, and short-term angiographic outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study of all ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that were treated with a WEB device (WEB Double-Layer, Single-Layer, and Single-Layer Sphere) between April 2012 and August 2014. Primary outcome measures included the feasibility of the implantation and the angiographic outcome at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included the clinical outcome at discharge and procedural complications. RESULTS Fifty-five aneurysms in 52 patients, including 14 ruptured aneurysms, underwent treatment with the WEB device. The median age of patients was 55 years (range, 30-75 years); 19/55 (37%) were men. The device could be deployed in all patients and was implanted in 51/55 (93%) cases. Procedural complications occurred in 6/51 (12%), comprising 2 thromboembolic events, 2 thrombus formations, 1 high-grade posterior cerebral artery stenosis, and 1 aneurysm rupture. None of these had clinical sequelae. Angiographic follow-up at 3 months was available for 44/51 (86%) aneurysms. A favorable angiographic result at 3 months was achieved in 29/44 (66%) cases, whereas the percentage of good anatomic results increased from 40% in 2012 to 75% in 2014. CONCLUSIONS The WEB device proved to be safe.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Survival in men diagnosed with de novo synchronous metastatic prostate cancer has increased following the use of upfront systemic treatment, using chemotherapy and other novel androgen receptor targeted agents, in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Local cytoreductive and metastasis-directed interventions are hypothesised to confer additional survival benefit. In this setting, IP2-ATLANTA will explore progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes with the addition of sequential multimodal local and metastasis-directed treatments compared with standard care alone. METHODS: A phase II, prospective, multicentre, three-arm randomised controlled trial incorporating an embedded feasibility pilot. All men with new histologically diagnosed, hormone-sensitive, metastatic prostate cancer, within 4 months of commencing ADT and of performance status 0 to 2 are eligible. Patients will be randomised to Control (standard of care (SOC)) OR Intervention 1 (minimally invasive ablative therapy to prostate±pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND)) OR Intervention 2 (cytoreductive radical prostatectomy±PLND OR prostate radiotherapy±pelvic lymph node radiotherapy (PLNRT)). Metastatic burden will be prespecified using the Chemohormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease (CHAARTED) definition. Men with low burden disease in intervention arms are eligible for metastasis-directed therapy, in the form of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) or surgery. Standard systemic therapy will be administered in all arms with ADT±upfront systemic chemotherapy or androgen receptor agents. Patients will be followed-up for a minimum of 2 years. Primary outcome: PFS. Secondary outcomes include predictive factors for PFS and overall survival; urinary, sexual and rectal side effects. Embedded feasibility sample size is 80, with 918 patients required in the main phase II component. Study recruitment commenced in April 2019, with planned follow-up completed by April 2024.

medical,"PURPOSE: To assess the utility of “influenza-like illness” (ILI) and whether it appropriately tests influenza vaccine effectiveness. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The WHO and CDC definitions of “influenza-like illness” are similar. However many studies use other definitions, some not specifying a temperature and requiring specific respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, making many samples non-comparable. Most ILI studies find less than 25% of cases are RT-PCR-positive, those which test for other viruses and bacteria usually find multiple other pathogens, and most identify no pathogen in about 50% of cases. ILI symptom and symptom combinations do not have high sensitivity or specificity in identifying PCR-positive influenza cases. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are increasingly used to screen ILI cases and they have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to RT-PCR in identifying influenza. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The working diagnosis of ILI presumes influenza may be involved until proven otherwise. Health care workers would benefit by renaming the WHO and CDC ILI symptoms and signs as “acute respiratory illness” and also using the WHO acute severe respiratory illness definition if the illness is severe and meets this criterion. This renaming would shift attention to identify the viral and bacterial pathogens in cases and epidemics, identify new pathogens, implement vaccination plans appropriate to the identified pathogens, and estimate workload during the viral season. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR). ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and in the operational definition of many surveillance databases and its imprecise definition may be inhibiting progress in research and treatment. The current ILI definition could with benefit be renamed “acute respiratory illness,” with additional definitions for “severe acute respiratory illness” (SARI) with RT-PCR testing for pathogens to facilitate prevention and treatment.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",y52-zO

medical,"The test-negative design is routinely used for the monitoring of seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness. More recently, it has become integral to the estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, in particular for more severe disease outcomes. Because the design has many important advantages and is becoming a mainstay for monitoring postlicensure vaccine effectiveness, epidemiologists and biostatisticians may be interested in further understanding the effect measures being estimated in these studies and connections to causal effects. Logistic regression is typically applied to estimate the conditional risk ratio but relies on correct outcome model specification and may be biased in the presence of effect modification by a confounder. We give and justify an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimator for the marginal risk ratio, which is valid under effect modification. We use causal directed acyclic graphs, and counterfactual arguments under assumptions about no interference and partial interference to illustrate the connection between these statistical estimands and causal quantities. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate and confirm our derivations and to evaluate the performance of the estimators. We find that if the effectiveness of the vaccine varies across patient subgroups, the logistic regression can lead to misleading estimates, but the IPTW estimator can produce unbiased estimates. We also find that in the presence of partial interference both estimators can produce misleading estimates.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",U-aTId

I also have a high Rh factor and positive ANA since last year. So something is going on with my immunity. My doctor prescribed me Valtrex but I couldn t afford right now, maybe I can have my MD call in something cheaper. Do I need to worry that this will turn into viral meningitis?

I am 30 yrs old female And never ever had this in my life. my friends tell me most ppl have the virus in their bodies, it comes out during stress. I was under intense stress before and never had this happen to me. Plus I had a blood test to check for herpes and other stuff two years ago and it was negative.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on psychological health. Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a non-judgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress in regular times, and may be relevant in mitigating harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, restrictions may necessitate this training being delivered online, rather than in in-person group settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to examine the effect of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as evaluate the effectiveness of online interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Participants were recruited (with no exclusion criteria) from enrollees in mindfulness courses at a local charity organization promoting mental wellness. Three groups were created, two that received their training during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person (N = 36) and videoconferencing (N = 38)), and a second control group of participants tested before the pandemic (N = 86). Primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels, and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups using analysis of covariance and two one-sided t-tests. RESULTS: Perceived stress and sleep quality did not differ significantly between groups at baseline. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P < .001), and this effect was statistically equivalent for videoconferencing compared to in-person training (P = .002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the pre-pandemic group (P < .001), but in neither of the groups during the pandemic. Participants reported shorter times to initiate sleep following mindfulness training pre-pandemic (P < .001), but not during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the online and comparison groups (P = .02), and participants engaged in marginally more daily practice in the online condition. CONCLUSIONS: Online mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for stress reduction but not sleep improvement during times when traditional in-person training is not feasible.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nmpL1B

medical,"BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii is a representative probiotic yeast that has been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, S. boulardii has not been studied as a microbial cell factory for producing useful substances. Agarose, a major component of red macroalgae, can be depolymerized into neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) by an endo-type ß-agarase. NAOSs, including neoagarotetraose (NeoDP4), are known to be health-benefiting substances owing to their prebiotic effect. Thus, NAOS production in the gut is required. In this study, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii was engineered to produce NAOSs by expressing an endo-type ß-agarase, BpGH16A, derived from a human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. RESULTS: In total, four different signal peptides were compared in S. boulardii for protein (BpGH16A) secretion for the first time. The SED1 signal peptide derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected as optimal for extracellular production of NeoDP4 from agarose. Expression of BpGH16A was performed in two ways using the plasmid vector system and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The production of NeoDP4 by engineered S. boulardii was verified and quantified. NeoDP4 was produced by S. boulardii engineered using the plasmid vector system and CRISPR-Cas9 at 1.86 and 0.80 g/L in a 72-h fermentation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on NAOS production using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii. Our results suggest that S. boulardii can be considered a microbial cell factory to produce health-beneficial substances in the human gut.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5lm00w

medical,"BACKGROUND: Following gender-affirming penile inversion vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty, patients may seek vulvar revision procedures for a variety of common aesthetic and functional concerns. These indications for revision and accompanying techniques are not well-described in the literature. METHODS: Patients who underwent vulvar revision surgery at the authors' institution were identified, and patient demographics, surgical indications, operative details, and complications were described. Common complaints requiring external genital revision were sorted into four categories: clitoral, labial, introital, and urethral. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a history of vaginoplasty underwent vulvar revision between May of 2017 and December of 2019. The mean age at surgical correction was 38.9 years. Ten patients (28.6 percent) had undergone prior secondary procedures (range, 1 to 3). Mean follow-up after revision surgery was 10.7 ± 8.7 months (range, 0 to 30.6 months). The majority of patients underwent concurrent revisions in multiple ""categories"". Labial aesthetic concerns were most common (n = 27, 77.1 percent), followed by clitoral (n = 20, 57.1 percent), urologic (n = 17, 48.6 percent), and introital complaints (n = 12, 34.3 percent). Twelve patients (34.3 percent) had canal stenosis requiring concurrent robot-assisted canal revision with peritoneal flaps. Complications included labial abscess (n = 1) and deep vein thrombosis (n = 1). Three patients (8.6 percent) underwent subsequent external genital revisions. Management approaches and surgical techniques for each of these common revision categories are provided. CONCLUSION: As more individuals seek vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, surgeons must be prepared to address a range of common aesthetic and functional complaints requiring vulvar revision.

Social Network Analysis tools are used to understand the pattern of movement. This research concluded that if the Government and Mainstream Media Twitter account triggered the conversation in the social media platform, followed by the activists and celebrities who engage in conversation between their followers, an ordinary person spread the point of view of the Government and Mainstream Media across their conversation network. The COVID-19 hashtag successfully engaged 10 protest clusters, which pushed the people to fight against COVID-19 in their countries, mostly targeting the government-related account. The digital social movement pattern is relatively different from the traditional social movement, even it has the same steps, which emerge, coalesce, bureaucratise, and the movement itself, but it takes place in the Digital Public Sphere without any social or political boundaries.

medical,"Currently, airborne transmission is seen as the most important transmission path for SARS-CoV-2. In this investigation, a classic dose-response model is used on the one hand to find out retrospectively the probable viral load of the infectious source patient at the time of transmission in 25 documented outbreaks. We showed that an infection due to airborne transmission at a distance from the infectious person was probably only possible in the 25 outbreaks examined, with attack rates of 4-100%, if the viral load had been higher than 1E+08 viral copies/ml. This demonstrates that the viral load estimated from the swab might overestimate a person's infectivity via aerosol, because a person is generally considered infectious, independent of the transmission way, when the viral load from the swab is 1E+06 viral copies/ml. On the other hand, a possible approach is presented to predict the probable situational Attack Rate (PARs) of a group of persons in a room through aerosol particles emitted by an infectious source patient. Four main categories of influence on the risk of infection are formed: First the emitted viruses, depending on the viral load and the amount of respiratory particles, and necessary number of reproducible viruses for infection, second the room-specific data and duration of stay of the group of people, third the activity of the exposed persons, and fourth the effect of personal protection (e.g. wearing masks from infectious and/or susceptible person). Furthermore, a simplified method is presented to calculate either the maximum possible number of persons in a room, so that probably a maximum of one person becomes infected when an infectious person is in the room, or the PARs,simple for a given number of persons, ventilation rate and time of occupancy. We additionally show, taking into account organizational preventive measures, which person-related virus-free supply air flow rates are necessary to keep the number of newly infected persons to less than 1. The simple approach makes it easy to derive preventive organizational and ventilation measures. Our results show that the volume flow rate or a person-related flow rate is a much more effective parameter to evaluate ventilation for infection prevention than the air change rate. We suggest to monitor the CO2 concentration as an easy to implement and valid measurement system for indoor spaces. Finally, we show that of the three measures, besides of wearing masks and increasing ventilation, testing contributes the most to the joint protective effect. This corresponds to the classic approach to implement protection concepts: preventing the source from entering the room and emitting viruses at all. In summary, a layered approach of different measures is recommended to mutually compensate for possible failures of any one measure (e.g. incorrect execution of tests, incorrect fit of masks or irregular window opening), to increase the degree of protection and thus reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",z-BxPm

medical,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health concern, with an exponentially growing number of patients worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a highly sensitive modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in the early stages of COVID-19. The typical features of COVID-19 in chest CT include bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations. Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement. The extensive pulmonary involvement in some of these pathologies may obscure the typical manifestation of COVID-19, whereas other preexisting pathologies may resemble the atypical or rare CT manifestations of this viral pneumonia.

medical,"The cellular entry of viruses represents a critical area of study, not only for viral tropism, but also because viral entry dictates the nature of the immune response elicited upon infection. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), caused by viruses within human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), is a severe, ocular surface infection associated with corneal inflammation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has previously been shown to play a critical role in entry of other HAdV species into many host cell types. However, HAdV-D endocytosis into corneal cells has not been extensively studied. Herein, we show an essential role for cholesterol rich, lipid raft microdomains and caveolin-1, in the entry of HAdV-D37 into primary human corneal fibroblasts. Cholesterol depletion using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) profoundly reduced viral infection. When replenished with soluble cholesterol, the effect of MβCD was reversed, allowing productive viral infection. HAdV-D37 DNA was identified in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection. Src kinase activity was also increased in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection, and Src phosphorylation and CXCL1 induction were both decreased in caveolin-1-/- mice corneas compared to wild type mice. siRNA knock down of caveolin-1 in corneal cells reduced chemokine induction upon viral infection, and caveolin-1-/- mouse corneas showed reduced cellular entry of HAdV-D37. As a control, HAdV-C2, a non-corneal pathogen, appeared to utilize the caveolar pathway for entry into A549 cells, but failed to infect corneal cells entirely, indicating virus and cell specific tropism. Immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the presence of caveolin-1 in HAdV-D37-containing vesicles during the earliest stages of viral entry. Collectively, these experiments indicate for the first time that HAdV-D37 uses a lipid raft mediated caveolin-1 associated pathway for entry into corneal cells, and connects the processes of viral entry with downstream proinflammatory cell signaling.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Z674at

medical,"Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly contagious cause of serious and often fatal disease in dogs worldwide despite the availability of safe and efficacious vaccines. Although a number of studies have focussed on identifying risk factors in disease development, risk factors associated with death from CPV are largely unknown. In this study we analysed a total of 1451 CPV cases reported from an Australian surveillance system – using univariate and multivariate techniques – to determine significant risk factors associated with death and euthanasia. A crude case fatality rate of 42.3% was estimated – higher than has been reported previously. We found that 3.3% of CPV cases had a history of vaccination in the previous 12 months, despite having completed the primary puppy vaccination course. The majority (89.5%) of these cases occurred in dogs <12 months of age, indicating failure of the primary vaccination course to provide protective immunity (most likely due to interference of the vaccine antigen with maternal antibodies but other reasons are discussed). Extending the age at which the final puppy vaccination is administered might be one of several strategies to consider. The final multivariate model showed that in non-litter CPV cases, risk of death was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer) and pedigree type (hounds and non-sporting dogs). Euthanasia in non-litter CPV cases was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer), state of residence (Northern Territory/South Australia/Tasmania combined), age (<six months) and vaccination status (unvaccinated and unknown). No significant risk factors associated with death were identified in cases in which there was more than one puppy in a litter infected. The risk factors identified in this study can be used as prognostic indicators for veterinarians faced with CPV cases. The possible explanations for the associations identified and their clinical relevance to CPV case outcome are discussed",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Utdk6w

medical,"We aimed to examine the circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the ICU. An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using RT-qPCR. Predictive models were constructed using LASSO regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, CRP or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variables = 0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay. Specific circulating miRNA profiles are associated with the severity of COVID-19.

medical,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral zoonotic disease affecting many African countries with the potential to spread to other geographical areas. RVF affects sheep, goats, cattle and camels, causing a high rate of abortions and death of newborn lambs. Also, humans can be infected, developing a usually self-limiting disease that can turn into a more severe illness in a low percentage of cases. Although different veterinary vaccines are available in endemic areas in Africa, to date no human vaccine has been licensed. In previous works, we described the selection and characterization of a favipiravir-mutagenized RVFV variant, termed 40Fp8, with potential as a RVF vaccine candidate due to the strong attenuation shown in immunocompromised animal models. Compared to the parental South African 56/74 viral strain, 40Fp8 displayed 7 amino acid substitutions in the L-protein, three of them located in the central region corresponding to the catalytic core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this work, by means of a reverse genetics system, we have analyzed the effect on virulence of these amino acid changes, alone or combined, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the simultaneous introduction of two changes (G924S and A1303T) in the heterologous ZH548-RVFV Egyptian strain conferred attenuated phenotypes to the rescued viruses as shown in infected mice without affecting virus immunogenicity. Our results suggest that both changes induce resistance to favipiravir likely associated to some fitness cost that could be the basis for the observed attenuation in vivo. Conversely, the third change, I1050V, appears to be a compensatory mutation increasing viral fitness. Altogether, these results provide relevant information for the safety improvement of novel live attenuated RVFV vaccines.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Tu-_cY

The high infection rate and the severe disease course led to major safety and social restriction measures worldwide. There is an urgent need of unbiased expert knowledge guiding the development of efficient treatment and prevention strategies. This report summarizes current immunological data on mechanisms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 development and progression to the most severe forms. We characterize the differences between adequate innate and adaptive immune response in mild disease and the deep immune dysfunction in the severe multiorgan disease. The similarities of the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are underlined. We also summarize known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors on epithelial barriers, immune cells, endothelium and clinically involved organs such as lung, gut, kidney, cardiovascular, and neuronal system. Finally, we discuss the known and potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of comorbidities, gender, and age in development of COVID-19.

medical,"We conducted in the Dahomey Gap (DG) a pioneer study on the genetic tracing of the African pangolin trade. We sequenced and genotyped 189 white-bellied pangolins from 18 forests and 12 wildlife markets using one mitochondrial fragment and 20 microsatellites loci. Tree-based assignment procedure showed the ‘endemicity’ of the pangolin trade, as strictly fed by the lineage endemic to the DG (DGL). DGL populations were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, an overall absence of equilibrium, inbreeding depression and lack of geographic structure. We identified a 92-98% decline in DGL effective population size 200-500 ya –concomitant with major political transformations along the ‘Slave Coast’– leading to contemporaneous estimates inferior to minimum viable population size. Genetic tracing suggested that wildlife markets from the DG sourced through the entire DGL range. Our loci provided the necessary power to distinguish among all the genotyped pangolins, tracing the dispatch of same individuals on the markets and within local communities. We developed an approach combining rarefaction analysis of private allele frequencies and cross-validation with observed data that could trace five traded pangolins to their forest origin, c. 200-300 km away from the markets. Although the genetic toolkit that we designed from traditional markers can prove helpful to trace the pangolin trade, our tracing ability was limited by the lack of population structure within DGL. Given the deleterious combination of genetic, demographic and trade-related factors affecting DGL populations, the conservation status of white-bellied pangolins in the DG should be urgently re-evaluated.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rDqQ80

medical,"As global systems rapidly change, our collective ability to predict future ecological dynamics will become increasingly important for successful natural resource management. By merging stakeholder objectives with system uncertainty, and by adapting actions to changing systems and knowledge, adaptive resource management (ARM) provides a rigorous platform for making sound decisions in a changing world. Critically, however, applications of ARM could be improved by employing benchmarks (i.e., points of reference) for determining when learning is occurring through the cycle of monitoring, modeling, and decision‐making steps in ARM. Many applications of ARM use multiple model‐based hypotheses to identify and reduce systematic uncertainty over time, but generally lack benchmarks for gauging discovery of scientific evidence and learning. This creates the danger of thinking that directional changes in model weights or rankings are indicative of evidence for hypotheses, when possibly all competing models are inadequate. There is thus a somewhat obvious, but yet to be filled niche for including benchmarks for learning in ARM. We contend that carefully designed “ecological null models,” which are structured to produce an expected ecological pattern in the absence of a hypothesized mechanism, can serve as suitable benchmarks. Using a classic case study of mallard harvest management that is often used to demonstrate the successes of ARM for learning about ecological mechanisms, we show that simple ecological null models, such as population persistence (N(t) (+1) = N(t) ), provide more robust near‐term forecasts of population abundance than the currently used mechanistic models. More broadly, ecological null models can be used as benchmarks for learning in ARM that trigger the need for discarding model parameterizations and developing new ones when prevailing models underperform the ecological null model. Identifying mechanistic models that surpass these benchmarks will improve learning through ARM and help decision‐makers keep pace with a rapidly changing world.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0RGQH3
medical,"The flipped classroom method requires that students engage with homework before coming to the classroom so that class time can be spent on active and collaborative learning exercises. Research has demonstrated that this can improve student performance versus traditional lecturer-led teaching methods. Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of teaching has been entirely online such that even ‘in-class’ time has been virtual. The current article examined whether online-only delivery affects the efficacy of the flipped classroom approach. Method: Grades for a research methods and statistics module and a statistics portfolio assignment were compared across consecutive cohorts of undergraduate psychology students taught by different methods. Results: Overall grades on the module did not differ significantly across teaching methods but student performance on statistics tests did. Flipped classrooms, whether accompanied by on-campus or synchronous online classes, led to significantly better performance than traditional methods. No detriment was observed by teaching entirely online. Conclusion: The key advantages of the flipped classroom method appear driven by active learning which can occur irrespective of classroom context. Teaching Implications: Using flipped classrooms can be a useful tool, particularly in subjects where students may otherwise be less engaged with the content.

medical,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two neutralising monoclonal antibody therapies (sotrovimab [Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline] and BRII-196 plus BRII-198 [Brii Biosciences]) for adults admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as hospitalised) with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multinational, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 [TICO]), adults (aged ≥18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 at 43 hospitals in the USA, Denmark, Switzerland, and Poland were recruited. Patients were eligible if they had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms for up to 12 days. Using a web-based application, participants were randomly assigned (2:1:2:1), stratified by trial site pharmacy, to sotrovimab 500 mg, matching placebo for sotrovimab, BRII-196 1000 mg plus BRII-198 1000 mg, or matching placebo for BRII-196 plus BRII-198, in addition to standard of care. Each study product was administered as a single dose given intravenously over 60 min. The concurrent placebo groups were pooled for analyses. The primary outcome was time to sustained clinical recovery, defined as discharge from the hospital to home and remaining at home for 14 consecutive days, up to day 90 after randomisation. Interim futility analyses were based on two seven-category ordinal outcome scales on day 5 that measured pulmonary status and extrapulmonary complications of COVID-19. The safety outcome was a composite of death, serious adverse events, incident organ failure, and serious coinfection up to day 90 after randomisation. Efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients randomly assigned to treatment who started the study infusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04501978. FINDINGS: Between Dec 16, 2020, and March 1, 2021, 546 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to sotrovimab (n=184), BRII-196 plus BRII-198 (n=183), or placebo (n=179), of whom 536 received part or all of their assigned study drug (sotrovimab n=182, BRII-196 plus BRII-198 n=176, or placebo n=178; median age of 60 years [IQR 50–72], 228 [43%] patients were female and 308 [57%] were male). At this point, enrolment was halted on the basis of the interim futility analysis. At day 5, neither the sotrovimab group nor the BRII-196 plus BRII-198 group had significantly higher odds of more favourable outcomes than the placebo group on either the pulmonary scale (adjusted odds ratio sotrovimab 1·07 [95% CI 0·74–1·56]; BRII-196 plus BRII-198 0·98 [95% CI 0·67–1·43]) or the pulmonary-plus complications scale (sotrovimab 1·08 [0·74–1·58]; BRII-196 plus BRII-198 1·00 [0·68–1·46]). By day 90, sustained clinical recovery was seen in 151 (85%) patients in the placebo group compared with 160 (88%) in the sotrovimab group (adjusted rate ratio 1·12 [95% CI 0·91–1·37]) and 155 (88%) in the BRII-196 plus BRII-198 group (1·08 [0·88–1·32]). The composite safety outcome up to day 90 was met by 48 (27%) patients in the placebo group, 42 (23%) in the sotrovimab group, and 45 (26%) in the BRII-196 plus BRII-198 group. 13 (7%) patients in the placebo group, 14 (8%) in the sotrovimab group, and 15 (9%) in the BRII-196 plus BRII-198 group died up to day 90. INTERPRETATION: Neither sotrovimab nor BRII-196 plus BRII-198 showed efficacy for improving clinical outcomes among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

medical,"BACKGROUND Traditionally, open hepatic resection is the first choice of treatment for symptomatic enlarging hepatic hemangiomas, which requires a large abdominal incision and is associated with substantial recovery time and morbidity. Minimally invasive laparoscopic resection has been used recently in liver surgery for treating selected hepatic hemangiomas. However, laparoscopic liver surgery poses the significant technical challenges and high rate of conversion. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been proved feasible in the treatment of hepatic hemangiomas with a size range of 5.0-9.9 cm. It is controversial to treat giant hepatic hemangiomas (≥10.0 cm) by means of RF ablation, due to the low technique success rate and high incidence of ablation-related complications. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined laparoscopic resection with intratumoral RF-induced coagulation for giant hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We treated 2 patients with giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma (12.0 cm and 13.1 cm in diameters respectively) by laparoscopic resection following intratumoral coagulation of the tumor with RF ablation. RESULTS Blood loss during resection was 100 ml (case 1) and 300ml (case 2) respectively. No blood transfusion and dialysis were needed during perioperative period. The two patients were discharged 6 days (case 1) and 12 days (case 2) after surgery without any complications, respectively. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT follow up showed there was no residual tumor. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to treat giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma by laparoscopic tumor resection boosted by intratumoral coagulation using RF ablation, which may open a new avenue for treating giant hemangioma.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",mg6Ayq

medical,"This paper analyses the herding behaviour among exchanges around the expiration of bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The database extends from December 2017 to October 2020, taking as a reference the main exchanges that trade bitcoin (Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit, Kraken, and Gemini) and using hourly closing prices and trading volumes in bitcoin and US dollars. Adapting the proposal of Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000) (CCK) to test conditional herding, we obtain results that indicate that the herding effect is significant during the week before expiration. After expiration, the herding effect lasts for a few hours and disappears. Information overload originating, among other causes, from sophisticated investors’ strategies may generate this mimetic behaviour. The results show the relevance of intraday data applied to specific events such as expiration since the unconditional analysis shows, in general, anti-herding behaviour throughout the period of study.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",I326u_

medical,"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represent one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, carrying a significant morbidity and risk of mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance among the common bacterial pathogens associated with HAP and VAP, especially Enterobacterales and nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, has made the choice of empiric treatment of these infections increasingly challenging. Moreover, failure of initial empiric therapy to cover the causative agents associated with HAP and VAP has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. This review provides an overview of antibiotics newly approved or in development for the treatment of HAP and VAP. The approved antibiotics include ceftobiprole, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and cefiderocol.

Insulin is one of the most well studied proteins, yet the genesis of its discovery was not getting much attention so far. Nevertheless, the history of the discovery of insulin is an exemplary of solving observational and scientific riddles, drudgery, patience and even professional turmoil. It is an inspiration for all medical personnel and scientists who are practising in the field of molecular medicine. Additionally, the genetic and epigenetic regulation of different types of diabetes needs to be addressed because of the widespread nature of the disease. Diabetes not only involves genetic predisposition but environmental factors, lifestyle etc. can be the major contributor for its inception. Nonetheless, viral infections at an early age are also found to trigger the onset of type I diabetes.

medical," Williams syndrome Williams-Beuren syndrome Summary Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. Causes Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. It may be passed down in families. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing Developmental delay Easily distracted, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting Inward bend of the small finger Learning disorders Mild to moderate intellectual disability Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music Short, compared to the rest of the person's family Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip Prominent lips with an open mouth Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Exams and Tests Signs include: Narrowing of some blood vessels Farsightedness High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles High blood pressure Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: Blood pressure check Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound Kidney ultrasound Treatment There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. Support Groups A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- williams-syndrome.org Outlook (Prognosis) About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Possible Complications Complications may include: Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels Pain in the abdomen When to Contact a Medical Professional Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. Prevention There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive. Review Date 10/26/2017 Updated by: Anna C. Edens Hurst, MD, MS, Assistant Professor in Medical Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL. Review provided by VeriMed Healthcare Network.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Innovative laboratory testing approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed to conduct research to establish estimates of prevalence and incidence. Self-specimen collection methods have been successfully used in HIV and sexually transmitted infection research and can provide a feasible opportunity to scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing for research purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing. To increase participation and minimize bias, epidemiologic research studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response should consider home specimen collection methods.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9d3peh

medical,"In recent years, the delivery of health services has undergone a major paradigm shift towards expanded outpatient services and widespread use of telemedicine. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a treatment recalcitrant neuropathic pain condition referring to pain persisting more than three months from the initial onset of an acute herpes zoster. QUTENZA® (capsaicin 8% patch) is a single 1-hr localized treatment for PHN and can provide several months of pain relief per application. However, patient access to capsaicin 8% patch is limited due to sensitive handling protocols that require the patch application to occur under physicians or healthcare professionals under the close supervision of a physician. Herein, we describe a successful treatment of PHN at-home, using capsaicin 8% patch, performed under full supervision and instruction from a physician using video telehealth services. SIGNIFICANCE: This is a case report of the successful treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia at-home using Capsaicin 8% patch.

medical,"This article focuses on Red Latinoamericana de Archivos, Museos, Acervos y Investigadores LGBTQIA+ (AMAI LGBTQIA+), a network composed of researchers and institutions related to LGBTQIA+ memory in Latin America, founded in 2019. First, the authors analyse the network's creation arising from the discontent of some participants of the June 2019 Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections (ALMS) Conference, in Berlin, who felt bothered by the lack of attention given to subaltern perspectives on LGBTQIA+ history and memory. Next, the authors describe and analyse the network's first year of activities communicated through its Facebook group. Multiple challenges arose from creating a network with members from different national origins, languages, and identities, especially considering the conservative political contexts of several Latin American countries and the social distancing measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, the authors present a general profile of the network's members and a map of partner institutions. Finally, the article points out some challenges to the network's continuity and its desire to render Latin America more visible in the broader panorama of global LGBTQIA+ history.

It rapidly became clear that although there was great experience in performing this surgery, the belief in its benefit relied on clinical case series and registry reports. Evidence fell well short of Evidence Based Medicine standards and robust guidance could not be produced on this basis.

Firstly, the Archimedean coupla and co-coupla are extended to handle linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy information (LICFI) and the operational law of linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy variables (LICFVs) based on extended copula (EC) and extended co-copula (ECC) are given. In addition, linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy copula weighted average (LICFCWA) operator and linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy copula weighted geometric (LICFCWG) operator are proposed based on EC and ECC under LICFI;Meanwhile, some special forms of LICFCWA/LICFCWG have been obtained by different types generators of ECs and ECCs. Thirdly, a novel MAGDM approach based on proposed LICFCWA/LICFCWG is constructed to solve the selection problem of the online education live platform in the period of the COVID-19, and a detailed parameter analysis was carried out. Fourthly, LICFS will degenerate into linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy set (LIFS) and intuitionistic cubic fuzzy set (ICFS), respectively, under different situations. Finally, some comparisons are carried out with other existing proposed MAGDM approaches. By comparing different types of experiments, the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach are also showed.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HY6Nca
medical,"BACKGROUND: Several reports on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variations in Indonesia COVID-19 cases led to genomic dysregulation with the first pandemic cases in Wuhan, China. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays an important role in this genetic regulation and contributes to the enhancement of viral RNA binding through the host mRNA. OBJECTIVE: This research is aimed to detect miRNA targets of SARS-CoV-2 and examines their role in Indonesia cases against Wuhan cases. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from GISAID ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ), NCBI ( https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), and National Genomics Data Center ( https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/ ) databases. MiRDB ( https://github.com/gbnegrini/mirdb-custom-target-search ) was used to annotate and predict target human mature miRNAs. For statistical analysis, we utilized a series chi-square test to obtain significant miRNA. DIANA-miRPath v3.0 ( http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv3 ) analyzed the Gene Ontology of mature miRNAs. RESULT: The statistical results detected five significant miRNAs. Two miRNAs: hsa-miR-4778-5p and hsa-miR-4531 were consistently found in the majority of Wuhan samples, while they were only found in less than half of the Indonesia samples. The other three miRNA, hsa-miR-6844, hsa-miR-627-5p, and hsa-miR-3674, were discovered in most samples in both groups but with a significant difference ratio. Among these five significant miRNA targets, hsa-miR-6844 is the only miRNA that has an association with the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The Gene Ontology analysis of five significant miRNA targets indicates a significant role in inflammation and the immune system. The specific detection of host miRNAs in this study shows that there are differences in the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 between Indonesia and Wuhan.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",AckpOI
medical,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept all over the world, several studies have shown the susceptibility of a patient with cancer to COVID-19. In this case, the removed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-adjacent (GBM-A), GBM-peritumor and GBM-central (GBM-C) tissues from a convalescent patient of COVID-19, who also suffered from glioblastoma meanwhile, together with GBM-A and GBM tissues from a patient without COVID-19 history as negative controls, were used for RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing and immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and the virus antigen (N protein). The results of RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some cells within human GBM tissues and SARS-CoV-2 in GBM-C tissue still exists even when it is cleared elsewhere. Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and N protein showed that the expressions of ACE2 are significantly higher in specimens, including GBM-C tissue from COVID-19 patient than other types of tissue. The unique phenomenon suggests that the surgical protection level should be upgraded even if the patient is in a convalescent period and the pharyngeal swab tests show negative results. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",iEyuM4

medical,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about how patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience their chronic disease, and how it impacts health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Compared to their more affluent counterparts, worse outcomes have been reported. A better understanding of the domains of HRQoL that are relevant to these specific populations is therefore needed. We explored the experiences of living with a chronic disease in low SES persons. METHODS: A qualitative interview study was performed in Flanders, Belgium. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in chronically ill patients, selected through purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed an inductive and iterative approach. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were interviewed. Six major themes were identified: a heavy bag to carry, loss of autonomous life, inner and outer loneliness, emotional imbalance, unmet need for support, and coping strategies. Patients experienced their illness as an additional problem on top of all other problems (i.e. financial/social problems, traumatic life events). In general, the disease burden and non-disease burden were mutually reinforcing, resulting in greater dependency, greater risk of social isolation, greater psychological distress, and greater risk of impaired HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed insight into the experiences of living with a chronic disease in low SES persons. A conceptual model is proposed that can be used in daily clinical practice to raise awareness among clinicians and health care providers that the patient’s needs go beyond the disease itself. Future research is needed to validate and test the model.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease. The combination therapy of methotrexate (MTX) and Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) is commonly used. Patients with RA are at increased risk of malignancy, however, it remains unclear whether the combination therapy is associated with a higher risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the malignancy risk among patients with RA receiving combination therapy of JAKi and MTX compared to MTX alone. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane and Embase were thoroughly searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with RA receiving JAKi and MTX, from inception to July 2020. Primary endpoints were malignancy events, Non melanomatous skin cancer (NMSC) and malignancy excluding NMSC and secondary endpoints were serious adverse events (SAE), deaths. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect method. RESULTS: 659 publications were screened and 13 RCTs with a total of 6911 patients were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in malignancy [RR = 1.42; 95% CI (0.59, 3.41)], neither NMSC [RR = 1.44 (0.36, 5.76)] nor malignancies excluding NMSC [RR = 1.12 (0.40, 3.13)]. No statistically significant difference between the two groups for SAE [RR = 1.15 (0.90, 1.47)] and deaths [RR = 1.99 (0.75, 5.27)] was found. CONCLUSION: The adjunction of JAKi to MTX is not associated with an increased risk of malignancy when compared to MTX alone. There is no increased risk of SAE and deaths when compared to MTX alone in patients with RA.

Beside from Hubei Province, no large-scale epidemiological data are available. The purpose of the study is to investigate the epidemiology of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shandong province, China. Methods Data were obtained from the Epidemic Daily Report Network. Confirmed patients and suspected cases in Shandong were included in the analysis. Data including age, sex, address, time of disease onset, time of diagnosis, and sources of transmission were collected. Results By February 13 th , 2020, 518 patients in Shandong province were formally confirmed with COVID-19 with an additional 78 suspected. Most of the confirmed patients were young or middle-aged (mean: 42.6 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.26:1. Among the 596 patients, 29.2% had a history of traveling in Hubei within 14 days. There were 99 cluster outbreaks and 5.23 cases were transmitted by one cluster outbreak. Among the confirmed patients, 17 patients (3.3%) had critical pneumonia, 36 (6.9%) had severe pneumonia and no deaths reported. Conclusions Considering the collective confirmed and suspected cases of SARS-Cov-2 in Shandong by February 13 th , 2020, males and the young and middle-aged populations were more frequently affected by the virus, which was most commonly transmitted through cluster outbreaks.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Scientific conferences which are considered as an important event for dissemination of research and related academic activities were badly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual format for interaction was used as an alternative method to continue such academic discourse. However, this did not provide the same level of communication and interest as that of in-person meetings. With evolving knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic especially its transmission, role of vaccine, and observing standard operating procedures (SOPs), fear among healthcare providers is mitigated to some extent. Keeping in mind the importance of scientific conferences in the context of sharing knowledge and its impact on the training of faculty members and postgraduate residents, a hybrid conference was planned by the national association of pediatric surgeons. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the challenges faced during the organization of this conference as well as to analyze the pattern of registration, number of abstracts received, the gender of the participants and their status, region of the country they represented, type of presentation made, and scientific subject covered. SPSS version 22 was used for data entry. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present data. Chi square test was applied to find out the association between categorical variables and a p value < 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: A total of 170 pediatric surgeons and postgraduate residents participated from all over the country and abroad. Nearly half (47.1%) of the registrants were postgraduate residents. Most of the participants (90%) opted for in-person attendance. The venue was selected with a capacity to house more than double the number of registrants with provision of safe distance. Availability of face masks, gloves, and sanitizers was ensured by the organizers. Packed meal boxes were arranged and served at the venue site in an open place on the terrace. A total of 97 abstracts were accepted for presentation that included 57 (58.8%) long oral podium and 40 (41.2%) poster presentations. Most of the studies (n=48–49.4%) were related to the subject of gastroenterology including pancreatico-hepatobiliary system and spleen. Majority of the presenters were male (p = 0.046) and postgraduate residents (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It was possible to organize a hybrid annual medical conference where most of the participants preferred physical presence. A rich scientific program was made to cater the needs for pediatric surgical fraternity. Residents made attractive presentations. It was noted that physical presence during clinical conference produced effective communication and learning.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",85XsJY

medical,"This article reviews the current knowledge on how viruses may utilize Extracellular Vesicle Assisted Inflammatory Load (EVAIL) to exert pathologic activities. Viruses are classically considered to exert their pathologic actions through acute or chronic infection followed by the host response. This host response causes the release of cytokines leading to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. However, viruses may employ an alternative pathway to soluble cytokine-induced pathologies-by initiating the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. The best-understood example of this alternative pathway is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-elicited EVs and their propensity to harm vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, an HIV-encoded accessory protein called the ""negative factor"" (Nef) was demonstrated in EVs from the body fluids of HIV patients on successful combined antiretroviral therapy (ART); it was also demonstrated to be sufficient in inducing endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction. This review will highlight HIV-Nef as an example of how HIV can produce EVs loaded with proinflammatory cargo to disseminate cardiovascular pathologies. It will further discuss whether EV production can explain SARS-CoV-2-mediated pulmonary and cardiovascular pathologies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WBrJUq

medical,"Objective. During the onset of a novel epidemic, there are public health priorities that need to be estimated, such as risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and clinical severity to allocate resources and issue health policies. In this work we calculate the risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19 conferred by demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity factors. Material and methods. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in [≥] 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization. Conclusions. In addition to confirming that older age, diabetes, HBP and obesity are the main risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19, we found that being indigenous, immunosuppression, smoking and asthma protect against infection, and the latter also against hospitalization.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",F7TTXn

medical,"The Black Sea is one of the main recreational facilities in Russia subject to a high annual anthropogenic stress. Anthropogenic activity led to high coastal sea waters pollution, eutrophy, and endangered the sea’s self-purification capabilities. The total quarantine introduced on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar territory associated with the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in anthropogenic pressure on coastal ecosystems and provided a unique opportunity to trace the dynamics of the most important hydrochemical indicators of coastal waters in the Tuapse district. The study aimed to characterize the impact of quarantine measures against the coronavirus on the state of coastal waters in the eastern part of the Russian Black Sea. For this, we identified and characterized the hydrochemical indicators and determined the effect of quarantine measures on their dynamics. The study used the standardized methods. The results obtained showed that a decrease in the recreational stress led to a proportional decrease in the pollutants supply to coastal sea waters;with the recreational stress resumption the concentrations of mobile pollutants tended to increase;a proportional relationship was established between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5 ) and the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+ ) concentration;the nitrates’ (NO3– ) concentration, in the seawater did not depend on the recreational stress degree. In particular, a proportional increase in NH4+ concentration and BOD5 in seawater was detected: in the third quarter of 2019 the concentration of NH4+ and BOD5 amounted to 3.0 mg/dm3 and 8.5 mg/dm3, and 3.8 mg/dm3 and 7.5 mg/dm3 in the fourth quarter, respectively;in the 2020 samples, a decrease in the NH4+ concentration to 0.8 mg/dm3 in the third and to 1.2 mg/dm3 in the fourth quarter led to a proportional decrease in BOD5 4.5 mg/dm3 and 3.9 mg/dm3, respectively. Thus, it was shown that the quarantine measures were shown to have a positive effect on the processes of self-purification of coastal sea waters in recreational zones. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

He has been on social security/disability ever since and has not been able to hold a job my entire life. My father avoids most social situations and any situation where he may have to speak to someone and answer questions, in fact, I must be careful speaking with him, because even discussing the possibility of a job interview or a doctors visit can trigger a panic attack. He even gets incredibly irritable, nervous, anxious and angry if a stranger like a tax consultant or insurance broker or someone will be coming to the house later. I have noticed that when forced to be social, a few beers is all it takes for him to act pretty much normal. He is still a bit shy, but no panic attacks, and he will even tell jokes and perhaps even make friends. This tells me that the condition must be treatable (although obviously not with alcohol). Other symptoms include shaking his feet a lot and vigorously rubbing his hands together. He also would spend a lot of time pacing around the house drinking coffee.

medical,"Behind the environmental regulatory capture (ERC) lies a complex network of interactions and interests. Identifying the roles of stakeholders in the ERC network and their behavioral motives can illuminate the mechanism of ERC incidents, and provide policy recommendations for reducing other types of regulatory capture. Drawing on the regulatory capture and principal-agent theories, this study develops a triple-layer principal-agent model of environmental regulation practices in China. We further conduct a social network analysis (SNA) on the ERC case in the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) of Bobai County, Guangxi Province, China to illustrate the hidden interactions and interest transmission structure among stakeholders in ERC. The results show that the ERC presents obvious characteristics of concealment and complexity, and individual capture often evolves into collective capture. Different stakeholders are in different positions and play different roles in the network. The environmental regulatory authority, the commissioned regulatory agency, and the agency of enterprises form the core power circle of the ERC network, in which the first two play the role of intermediary and the latter acts as an initiator. They together occupy the structural hole position and dominate the evolution of the ERC network. Peripheral structure stakeholders play the role of “bridge” and profit from the expanding ERC network. It is recommended that the principle of decentralization and the balance of power must be taken into consideration. Quantitative analysis methods such as SNA should be applied to clarify accountability when punishing responsible persons. More subjects are also encouraged to participate in environmental regulations and report illegal acts actively. Finally, a blacklist system should be established in the field of environmental protection for regulating the professional and social morality of all parties.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",IKq0KJ

medical,"OBJECTIVES To compare the relation of quality of life to occupational coping and verify the association of these indicators with sociodemographic variables of tenured and outsourced nurses. METHODS Cross-sectional study, carried out from June to November 2014, with 145 outsourced nurses and 45 tenured nurses. We applied an identification instrument (WHOQOL-bref) and Occupational Coping Scale. Student's t-tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used. RESULTS Tenured nurses had better quality of life (p=0.011) and a mean in the Avoidance factor with a strong correlation (p=0.001). Female public servants (p=0.006; p<0.0001), between 40 and 66 years old (p=0.005; p=0.031), specialists (p=0.028; p=0.005), with a family income from 2.5 to 6.8 minimum wages (p=0.021; p=0.006) and working in the morning or afternoon (p=0.043; p=0.020) and morning and afternoon (p=0.038; p=0.007) showed a difference in quality of life and in Avoidance factor, respectively.

medical,"My wife has Polycystic ovary syndrome and has irregular periods since early age (18 years old). She used to get period irregular periods in intervals of 1-3 months. In this regard, we visited Fortis Mumbai and started the treatment there. 1. At Fortis Mumbai, we were suggested to take female contraceptives for 3-6 months with the hope that it might help to regularize periods and try naturally afterwards. We tried for 3 months after that but this did not help as there were muliple follicles and mature follicle/ egg formation. 2. Thereafter, we were suggested to go for Clomid to stimulate ovolution. We tried this method for another 6 months but this did not help inspite of increased dosage. The scans during this time still reflected multiple follicules and no single mature follicle (upto maximum 10 mm size). 3. After that, we shifted to Bangalore with the focus of getting results in this regard and visited Fortis Bangalore . We were suggested to undergo various tests like fallopian tube ( HSG ), tuberculosis, semen analysis etc. All the tests were normal and she confirmed that Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCO ) is the only problem and that we should go for IUI as taking clomid for long duration may have side effects. 4. Since then my wife has undergone 3 IUIs and there has not been any positive results, with no explained reasons for failure. We have been suggested that we should try for 3-6 IUIs before thinking of IVF. During the 3 IUIs, genotropin injections was taken from Day 2 for 7-10 days and .The egg formation has been proper and size of mature follicule at the time time of doing IUI has been 18+mm. All this while, my wife is taking follic acid, metformin and CoQ tablets. However, at this point we thought of seeking your expert opinion since you are an expert in this field.

medical,"High-resolution structures reveal that yeast ribosomal protein L11 and its bacterial/archael homologs called L5 contain a highly conserved, basically charged internal loop that interacts with the peptidyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) T-loop. We call this the L11 ‘P-site loop’. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth. These analyses suggest that the L11 P-site loop normally helps to optimize ribosome function by monitoring the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",mHJ8OI

medical,"OBJECTIVES: The National Institute for Infectious Diseases ‘Prof. Dr. Matei Balș’ was the designated centre for managing Ebola alerts in Romania during the 2014 African outbreak. We surveyed Ebola knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP) among the institute's healthcare workers. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The study consisted of a self-administered paper-based anonymous questionnaire that included 24 closed-item questions and two scales of personal concern. RESULTS: Respondents were generally well informed; compared to nurses, doctors recorded a 1.9-fold higher rate of correct responses regarding Ebola transmission (P < 0.001), but both nurses and doctors correctly identified Ebola's aetiological agent. Nurses perceived higher personal (P = 0.008) and family (P < 0.001) risk than doctors. Respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about Ebola (P = 0.019) and its prevention options (P = 0.033). Males were 6.7-fold more likely to volunteer than females (P = 0.001) and so were graduates of higher rather than lower education (1.5-fold more likely, P = 0.017) and doctors than nurses (1.7-fold more likely, P = 0.018). The institute ranked first among sources of information on Ebola; respondents who had received Ebola training in the institute 2 years previously were 1.2–1.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes. CONCLUSIONS: We have characterised KAP on Ebola disease among Romanian healthcare workers from a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest.

medical,"Background: International travel during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic carries a certain magnitude of infection risk both to travelers and their destination, which may be difficult to assess in the early stage. The characteristics of common infectious diseases of tourists may provide some clues to identify the high-risk travelers and protect susceptible population. Methods: From among 48,444 travelers screened at Shanghai Port, we analyzed 577 travelers with 590 infectious diseases for age, sex, disease type, and World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We used the Joinpoint Regression Program to identify the average percent changes (APC) in the various trends among these individuals. Results: Hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV were the most common infectious diseases in travelers entering China, and Hepatitis B, pulmonary tuberculosis, and syphilis in Chinese nationals traveling abroad (overall detection rates, 1.43 and 0.74%, respectively; P < 0.05). Africa (2.96%), the Americas (1.68%), and the Western Pacific (1.62%) exhibited the highest detection rates. This trend did not decrease since the COVID-19 pandemic (P > 0.05) and rather showed an upward trend with increasing age [APC 95% CI = 5.46 (3.41,7.56)%, P < 0.05]. However, there were no evident trends in monthly infection rates of travelers exiting and entering China from different WHO regions (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Travelers always carry a transmission risk of common infectious diseases. It may be reasonable to adjust strategies for airport screening and quarantine according to the age and departure area of travelers to prevent and control new infectious diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",t0DpPD

By the use of high-speed networks, the process of acquisition of evidence can be achieved with durability. The system enables evidence collection, preservation and analysis to be performed with minimal disruption to regular operations. The paper presents experimental observation and evaluation of results on remote routing to devices for volatile data collection, providing additional insights to devices, preserving data in the cloud. The system proceeds with virtual machine snapshots based crime scene recreation for cloud forensic investigation of evidence.

medical,"In this plain language podcast, highlights from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 are discussed from the perspective of both a patient and a healthcare professional. The patient advocacy track at the congress was co-developed with patients, and was integrated into the overall programme. It included four sessions on the financial impact of cancer, treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer, technology, and rare cancers. This comes at a time when there is an increasing focus on the value of real-world data (data from a real-life setting, rather than in a clinical trial) and a more active role for patients and patient organisations as partners in research. Challenges and opportunities arising during the COVID-19 pandemic were also discussed, including logistical complexities in healthcare and consequent uncertainty for patients in accessing care, and opportunities including increased use of telemedicine and broader participation offered by virtual/on-site hybrid congress formats, as used in ESMO 2021. Data discussed on combination treatments for patients with bladder cancer suggest an improved chance of remission for patients intolerant or resistant to existing treatment. Some of the data from studies in kidney cancer also suggest that treatment breaks or longer periods between treatment can improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs, without reducing treatment effectiveness. Although data on bladder and kidney cancer studies were seen to be promising, the authors recognise the time it takes for such findings to reach clinical practice, and the importance of managing expectations in the patient community. The authors conclude their discussion by reflecting on key challenges and opportunities moving forward, including restoring and improving care and efficiency of cancer services, and working together with patient advocates and advocacy organisations as essential partners in achieving this.

medical,"A mathematical model has been proposed to describe the deformation behavior of a cell, when a coronavirus enters it. The model is continuum-based, and the theory of elasticity is used in calculations. It was found that the deformation process accompanying the penetration of coronavirus consists of two stages. At the first stage, the deformations of cytoplasmic membrane are elastic. At the second stage, the structure of a cytoplasmic membrane is destroyed. The dependence of the energy of the “coronavirus–cell” system on the size of the contact zone that separates the coronavirus and the cell was obtained. The existence of an energy barrier that separates both stages of the deformation process was proved. As a result, the penetration of the coronavirus terminates at the end of the first stage. However, the energy barrier can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations. L.A. BULAVIN, YU.F. ZABASHTA, K.I.

medical,"COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for a strong health system for the social protection of people and to improve health programme implementation in the coming years. India has made great progress in health over the past 50 years;however, despite the progress made, it is faced with several challenges. While infectious diseases remain an unfinished agenda, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rising and are now the leading cause of mortality in the country. This is further compounded by the prevailing inequalities in access to quality health care among population groups including those living in remote rural areas. To achieve Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, India in 2017 revised its National Health Policy and committed itself to attain the highest possible level of good health and well-being, through preventive and promotive health interventions. While policies are enunciated and plans are formulated, the implementation at ground level is at best tardy and lack lustre As an administrative unit for programme implementation, a district has a key role to play in implementing national programmes and in delivery of basic health services to the people. They are strategically placed to plan, organise and lead efforts meant to deliver primary health care services through better management of existing resources and by fully engaging all relevant stakeholders in contributing towards achievement of national health goals and in responding to a public health emergency such as Covid-19. Planning and managing health problems need an improved and responsive health governance. Strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation require integration and coordination of various health programmes including dealing with health crises, fostering inter-sectoral involvement and engagement of the community as a key actor.

medical,"Age-related changes in the human brain functioning crucially affect the motor system, causing increased reaction time, low ability to control and execute movements, difficulties in learning new motor skills. The lifestyle and lowered daily activity of elderly adults, along with the deficit of motor and cognitive brain functions, might lead to the developed ambidexterity, i.e., the loss of dominant limb advances. Despite the broad knowledge about the changes in cortical activity directly related to the motor execution, less is known about age-related differences in the motor initiation phase. We hypothesize that the latter strongly influences the behavioral characteristics, such as reaction time, the accuracy of motor performance, etc. Here, we compare the neuronal processes underlying the motor initiation phase preceding fine motor task execution between elderly and young subjects. Based on the results of the whole-scalp sensor-level electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, we demonstrate that the age-related slowing down in the motor initiation before the dominant hand movements is accompanied by the increased theta activation within sensorimotor area and reconfiguration of the theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Jp92-U

medical,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and outcome profiles of tunnelled dialysis catheter (TDC) insertions and exchanges with fluoroscopy versus without fluoroscopy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all TDC insertions or exchanges performed at our centre, between January 2017 and December 2017. Patient demographics, laboratory results and catheter placement information were obtained from electronic records. Immediate technical success, early and late catheter associated complications were collected. Outcomes for TDC inserted with or without fluoroscopy were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 351 TDC insertions and 253 TDC exchanges were performed. Out of 351 TDC insertions, 261 were done with fluoroscopy while 90 were done without. Out of 253 TDC exchanges, 219 were done with fluoroscopy while 34 were done without. For both TDC insertions and exchanges, there were no significant differences in complication rates when done with or without fluoroscopy. Mean duration of catheter patency was longer for TDC inserted without fluoroscopy, after adjusting for site of insertion and presence of previous TDC. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of inserting TDC in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) without fluoroscopy is a safe and effective method in selected patients. This supports the practice of performing the procedure without fluoroscopy, especially in institutions where fluoroscopy facilities are not readily available. This potentially translates into reduced healthcare resources and hospitalisation days, which is particularly valuable in times of limited resources such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2gjcI7

medical,"Background: Cancer patients are considered as highly vulnerable individuals in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We studied the clinical characteristics of survivor and non-survivor COVID-19-infected cancer patients in Pakistan. Patients and Methods: We did a retrospective study of 70 cancer patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore and Peshawar, Pakistan between April 13 and July 09, 2020. These patients were discharged from the hospital or had died by July 09, 2020. Clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors by fisher's exact test and chi-square test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to explore the risk factors of mortality. Results: Seventy cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled and the majority were males 38 (54.3%). 57 (81.4%) had solid tumors and 13 (18.6%) had hematological malignancies. Dyspnea (44 cases) was the most common symptom (62.9%). Complications were reported in 51 (72.9%) patients during the course of disease. 19 (27.1%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). A significant increase in the C-reactive protein level and neutrophil count was observed in the deceased patients as compared to the surviving patients. D-dimer values of &gt;=0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with mortality (P=0.01). We identified two independent risk factors associated with death, ICU admission (P=0.007) and D-dimer (P=0.003). Conclusion: Pakistani cancer patients with COVID-19 infection reported poor prognosis.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the national distribution of COVID‐19 hospital and emergency department visitor restriction policies across the United States, focusing on patients with cognitive or physical impairment or receiving end‐of‐life care. METHODS: Cross‐sectional study of visitor policies and exceptions, using a nationally representative random sample of EDs and hospitals during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic, by trained study investigators using standardized instrument. RESULTS: Of the 352 hospitals studied, 326 (93%) had a COVID‐19 hospital‐wide visitor restriction policy and 164 (47%) also had an ED‐specific policy. Hospital‐wide policies were more prevalent at academic than non‐academic (96% vs 90%; P < 0.05) and at urban than rural sites (95% vs 84%; P < 0.001); however, the prevalence of ED‐specific policies did not significantly differ across these site characteristics. Geographic region was not associated with the prevalence of any visitor policies. Among all study sites, only 58% of hospitals reported exceptions for patients receiving end‐of‐life care, 39% for persons with cognitive impairment, and 33% for persons with physical impairment, and only 12% provided policies in non‐English languages. Sites with ED‐specific policies reported even fewer exceptions for patients with cognitive impairment (29%), with physical impairments (24%), or receiving end‐of‐life care (26%). CONCLUSION: Although the benefits of visitor policies towards curbing COVID‐19 transmission had not been firmly established, such policies were widespread among US hospitals. Exceptions that permitted family or other caregivers for patients with cognitive or physical impairments or receiving end‐of‐life care were predominantly lacking, as were policies in non‐English languages.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6z8pZE

We investigated proteomic signatures related to COVID-19 risk variants rs657152 (ABO), rs10735079 (OAS1/OAS2/OAS3), rs2109069 (DPP9), rs74956615 (TYK2), rs2236757 (IFNAR2) and rs11385942 (SLC6A20/LZTFL1/CCR9/FYCO1/CXCR6/XCR1) as well as their corresponding downstream pathways that may promote severe COVID-19 in risk allele carriers and their potential relevancies to other infection outcomes. METHODS: A DNA aptamer-based array measured 4,870 plasma proteins among 11,471 participants. Linear regression estimated associations between the COVID-19 risk variants and proteins with correction for multiple comparisons, and canonical pathway analysis was conducted. Cox regression assessed associations between proteins identified in the main analysis and risk of incident hospitalized respiratory infections (2,570 events) over a 20.7-year follow-up. RESULTS: The ABO variant rs657152 was associated with 84 proteins in 7,241 white participants with 24 replicated in 1,671 Black participants. The TYK2 variant rs74956615 was associated with ICAM-1 and -5 in white participants with ICAM-5 replicated in Black participants. Of the 84 proteins identified in the main analysis, seven were significantly associated with incident hospitalized respiratory infections including Ephrin type-A receptor 4 (HR: 0.87; p=2.3x10-11) and von Willebrand factor type A (HR: 1.17; p=1.6x10-13). CONCLUSIONS: Novel proteomics signatures and pathways for COVID-19-related risk variants TYK2 and ABO were identified.

Retrospectively, 130 residual nasopharyngeal swabs transferred in viral transport medium (VTM), pre-examined for COVID-19 through emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved real-time RT-PCR assay and tested with GenBody&#8482; COVAG025, revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 90.00% (27/30; 95% CI: 73.47% to 97.89%) and 98.00% (98/100; 95% CI: 92.96% to 99.76%), respectively, fulfilling WHO guidelines. Subsequently, the prospective examination of 200 symptomatic and asymptomatic nasopharyngeal swabs, collected on site and tested with GenBody&#8482; COVAG025 and EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assay simultaneously, revealed a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of 94.00% (94/100; 95% CI: 87.40% to 97.77%) and 100.00% (100/100; 95% CI: 96.38% to 100.00%), respectively.

We use SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in this system to confirm susceptibility to known inhibitors (boceprevir, GC376, PF-00835231, and PF-07321332/nirmatrelvir) and reevaluate other reported inhibitors (baicalein, ebselen, carmofur, ethacridine, ivermectin, masitinib, darunavir, and atazanavir). Moreover, we show that the system can be adapted to report both the function and the chemical inhibition of proteases from different coronavirus species as well as from distantly related viruses.

medical,"OBJECTIVES To describe the structure and implementation of a model in which hospitalists focus on a particular hospital unit or area, referred to as ""geographic rounding,"" and to analyze its effect on hospitalist efficiency, interruptions, after-hours work, and satisfaction. METHODS The leadership of our academic hospital medicine group designed a geographic rounding intervention with the goal of improving provider satisfaction and mitigating burnout. Our quantitative analysis compared the pre-intervention and post-intervention time periods with regard to progress note completion time, after-hours progress note completion, secure messaging communication volume, and Mini-Z survey results. A post-intervention qualitative analysis was performed to further explore the relationship between geographic rounding and the drivers of burnout. RESULTS Following the intervention, 97% of geographic rounders were localized to one or two geographic areas and 77% were localized to a single geographic area. Following the implementation of geographic rounding, progress notes were completed an average of 29 minutes earlier (p<0.001). The proportion of progress notes completed after-hours decreased from 25.1% to 20% (p<0.001). The volume of secure messages received by hospitalists decreased from 1.95 to 1.8 per patient per day (p<0.001). The proportion of hospitalists reporting no burnout increased from 77.8% to 93% after implementing geographic rounding, a change that did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1). Qualitative analysis revealed mixed effects on work environment but improvements in efficiency, patient-centeredness, communication with nurses, and job satisfaction. CONCLUSION Geographic rounding represents an organization-level change that has the potential to improve hospitalist career satisfaction.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fEokom
medical,"Potassium is the most important intracellular cation and the kidneys play a pivotal role in potassium homeostasis. Potassium disorder is a common electrolyte abnormality and it increases the risk of death from any cause, particularly cardiovascular events. Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality encountered post organ transplantation. The etiology is multifactorial, and includes drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors. In certain regards, the clinical picture of post-transplantation hyperkalemia and hypertension resembles that of Gordon syndrome or familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a disorder characterized by over activity of thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter. Effective and safe management of chronic hyperkalemia can be challenging in this special patient population. Despite the significant short-term and long-term side effects, fludrocortisone (a potent synthetic oral mineralocorticoid receptor agonist) has emerged as the default drug of choice for treatment of refractory hyperkalemia in many organ transplant recipients. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of fludrocortisone for management of hyperkalemia in organ transplant recipients remains unknown. This review discusses potassium homeostasis, including the role of the kidneys, and focuses on calcineurin inhibitor-induced hyperkalemia and on the under-appreciated role of thiazide-type diuretic use in management of hyperkalemia and hypertension.

medical,"Different surgical techniques exist for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), of which minimally invasive techniques have become the standard. We reviewed our experience with management and treatment of ZD and sought to determine what type of treatment is most effective and efficient. We selected patients who underwent treatment for ZD between January 2004 and January 2014 at our tertiary referral center. All procedures were performed by ENT surgeons. The medical records were reviewed for pre- and intraoperative characteristics and follow-up. Of our 94 patients (58 male, 36 female), 75 underwent endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy (42 stapler, 33 laser) and 6 received treatment via transcervical approach. 13 interventions were aborted. Mean operating time was 49.0 min for stapler, 68.3 for laser and 124.0 for the transcervical approach. Its respective median post-operative admission durations were 2.0, 3.0 and 3.0 days. After the first treatment, of the 75 endoscopic procedures, 45 patients (23 stapler, 22 laser) had complete symptom resolution. In the transcervical group 4 (67 %) patients were symptom free and one patient died of complications. In the endoscopically treated patients, ten complications occurred, of which 8 G1 and 2 G2 (Clavien Dindo classification). In the transcervical group 2 complications occurred, 1 G3b and 1 G5. Both endoscopic techniques provide efficient management of Zenker's diverticulum with the stapler-assisted modality providing a shorter surgery duration and hospital admission. Although there is no significant difference in terms of complications or recurrence rates for both endoscopic techniques, it seems that stapler patients are at higher risk of having a re-intervention and of having more severe complications.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tZta6B

medical,"INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 is associated with a high mortality rate, though outcomes of the different lung compliance phenotypes are unclear. We aimed to measure lung compliance and examine other factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. METHODS Adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive mechanical ventilation at 8 hospitals in Singapore were prospectively enrolled. Factors associated with both mortality and differences between high (<40mL/cm H2O) and low (<40mL/cm H2O) compliance were analysed. RESULTS A total of 102 patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation were analysed; 15 (14.7%) did not survive. Non-survivors were older (median 70 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67-75 versus median 61 years, IQR 52-66; P<0.01), and required a longer duration of ventilation (26 days, IQR 12-27 vs 8 days, IQR 5-15; P<0.01) and intensive care unit support (26 days, IQR 11-30 vs 11.5 days, IQR 7-17.3; P=0.01), with a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (15 patients [100%] vs 40 patients [46%]; P<0.01). There were 67 patients who had lung compliance data; 24 (35.8%) were classified as having high compliance and 43 (64.2%) as having low compliance. Mortality was higher in patients with high compliance (33.3% vs 11.6%; P=0.03), and was associated with a drop in compliance at day 7 (-9.3mL/cm H2O (IQR -4.5 to -15.4) vs 0.2mL/cm H2O (4.7 to -5.2) P=0.04).

medical,"Background Pleural cryobiopsy is a novel technique for the diagnosis of pleural pathologies. However, the safety and feasibility of this modality compared to standard forceps for pleural biopsy has not been fully elucidated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to establish the efficacy and safety of cryobiopsy for evaluation of undiagnosed pleural effusion. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of science databases up to December 16, 2021 to identify relevant articles. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, retrospectives studies and case series that compared pleural cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy. A qualitative assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results Of the 365 articles identified by our search, 15 studies were eligible for inclusion. The specimen sizes obtained with cryobiopsy were significantly larger compared with forceps biopsy (Standard mean difference 1.16; 95 % CI: 0.51-1.82; P < 0.01). Furthermore, the cryobiopsy tissue specimens were deeper (OR 2.68; 95 % CI: 1.39-5.16; P < 0.01) and qualitatively better with less crush artifacts (OR 0.06; 95 % CI: 0.01-0.26; P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield (OR 1.32; 95 % CI: 0.79-2.21; P = 0.29) and mild to moderate bleeding events (OR 1.21; 95 % CI: 0.64-2.29; P = 0.57) between pleural cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy. No publication bias was observed among these studies. Conclusions Compared to flexible forceps biopsy pleural cryobiopsy obtained larger and deeper tissue specimens with less crush artifacts but does not show superiority for diagnostic yield.

medical,"Introduction Les maladies systémiques sont un groupe hétérogène de pathologies. La vulnérabilité aux infections qu’elles engendrent de par leurs mécanismes auto-immuns et les traitements immunosuppresseurs souvent nécessaires à leur contrôle, a constitué un challenge au temps de l’épidémie à SARS-CoV-2. Cependant, des résultats contradictoires de l’évolution clinique des patients ayant une maladie systémique infectés par le SARS-CoV-2 ont été observés. L’objectif de notre travail était d’étudier les caractéristiques cliniques et l’évolution de nos patients suivis en médecine interne pour une maladie systémique et ayant contracté le virus SARS-CoV-2. Patients et méthodes Étude rétrospective descriptive portant sur les dossiers des patients suivis en médecine interne pour une maladie systémique et ayant contracté le virus SARS-CoV-2. Résultats Parmi 407 patients infectés au SARS-CoV-2, 12 étaient suivis pour maladie auto-immune. Ils étaient répartis comme suit : lupus érythémateux systémique (n = 4), maladie de Behçet (n = 4), syndrome de Sjögren (n = 2), dermatomyosite (n = 1), et sclérodermie systémique (n = 1). Il s’agissait de 10 femmes et de deux hommes dont l’âge moyen au moment de l’infection était de 45,5±11,7 ans [31-77]. La durée moyenne d’évolution de la maladie systémique était de 106,16 mois [2-360]. Trois de ces 12 patients avaient une atteinte viscérale grave (insuffisance rénale chronique et pneumopathie interstitielle diffuse compliquée de fibrose pulmonaire). Deux patients étaient vaccinés avant l’infection. Au moment de l’infection, cinq patients étaient sous corticoïdes et trois sous immunosuppresseurs. Ces traitements n’ont pas été arrêtés pour aucun patient, et aucun n’a présenté de poussée de sa maladie lors de l’infection. Les signes cliniques étaient dominés par l’asthénie (n = 12), la toux (n = 9), la fièvre (n = 6), la dyspnée (n = 6) et les diarrhées et vomissements (n = 2). La moitié des patients a nécessité une hospitalisation pour une pneumopathie hypoxémiante. Ces patients représentaient 1,47 % des patients hospitalisés dans notre hôpital entre mars 2020 et août 2021, qui étaient au nombre de 407. La durée moyenne d’hospitalisation était de 15jours [5-30]. Les scanners thoraciques de ces ont montré des atteintes parenchymateuses modérés à sévères chez quatre patients. Dans les deux cas restant, les lésions dues au virus n’ont pas pu être distingués des lésions de PID préexistantes. Trois patients hospitalisés ont nécessité un transfert en réanimation. Deux patients y sont décédés, soit 4,25 % des décès par le SARS-CoV-2 dans notre hôpital. L’évolution était favorable pour les autres malades. Conclusion L’infection à SARS-CoV-2 ne semble pas plus fréquente ni plus sévère chez les patients ayant une maladie systémique que chez la population générale.

medical,"In an attempt to move the field of public health from documenting health disparities to acting to rectify them, in 2001, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recognized racism as a fundamental cause of racial health disparities. Both APHA and the Council on Education for Public Health have moved to incorporate new competencies in health equity for public health professionals. As schools and programs of public health work to establish curricular offerings in race and racism, a need exists to identify approaches currently in use that can be replicated, adapted, and scaled. This systematic review sought to identify pedagogical methods and curricula that exist to support the training of US public health students in understanding racism as a structural determinant of health. We found 11 examples from peer-reviewed literature of curricula, lessons, and competencies that have been developed by public health faculty and departments since 2006. The articles discussed a range of approaches to teaching about structural racism in public health, suggesting that little consensus may exist on how to best teach this material.

medical,"Background and importance Faced with the lockdown caused by COVID-19 since March 2020, we have been reorganising the external patients department to get medicines to our patients To avoid the displacement of patients to the hospital during the state of alarm, we developed a drug delivery system Aim and objectives To analyse the opinion of patients about the new home delivery programme of their medication during the COVID-19 pandemic Material and methods Retrospective surveys were conducted with our patients between April and July (they had received their medication between 15 March and 30 June) with the following questions: sex and age, distance from their home to our hospital, employment situation, score for status of the medication at the time of delivery, punctuality of delivery, willingness to pay for transportation for new shipments and general satisfaction Results 1123 medication deliveries to 751 patients took place, of which 123 surveys were conducted with our patients (63% men, with the following age ranges: 18-40 years (23 6%), 41-64 years (49 6%) and &gt;65 years (20 8%) Most patients (69 1%) lived between 10 and 50 km away from our hospital A high percentage of patients did not have a job: students, pensioners or unemployed (49 6%) Our patients scored an average of 9 87 out of 10 for the status of the medication (correct temperature, correct expiration date and correct packaging) given to them Regarding punctuality, the patients scored an average of 9 86 out of 10 for punctuality of delivery We also asked our patients if they would be willing to pay the transportation costs for shipping their medication The result was that 74% of patients strongly or fairly agreed to cover these costs Finally, regarding the general satisfaction of our patients in this new system, the result was that 91% were totally satisfied and 9% were quite satisfied No survey was returned with the result quite dissatisfied or not at all satisfied Conclusion and relevance Based on the results, our new outpatient drug delivery programme obtained very good scores in these surveys and it could be an alternative for patients with mobility problems who live far away Also, many patients would be willing to pay for transportation",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ABujU7
medical,"Background: Radiation-induced skin injury remains a serious concern, which may limit the duration and dose of radiation treatment. The concept that stem cell injection may reduce tissue injury or assist its recovery after radiation has been recently argued. Herein, we examined the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) on radiation-induced skin damage in rats. Methods: This study is an experimental case control study. ASCs were isolated from peri uterine fat tissue of the rats. Then the rats received a 30 Gy single dose radiation to their buttocks skin using gamma radiation. Next day stem cells were transplanted subcutaneously in 16 rats as the case group. A group of 16 rats was considered as control group with radiation but no transplantation of stem cells. Then rats were examined and observed by macroscopic analysis and phenotypic scores during 4 weeks of follow up. Results: The wound size in control group was significantly higher than case group in the second, third and fourth weeks of evaluation (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in skin lesion severity, pathological factors, and the onset of recovery signs between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: It seems that using ASCs alone has not profound effects on reducing radiation-induced cutaneous complications, while combination of these cells with growth factors may produce more promising results.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-AM5IU

medical,"Given the enormous social and health impact of the pandemic triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the scientific community made a huge effort to provide an immediate response to the challenges posed by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme, called 3CLpro or main protease, already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure, as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations. Our results also shed light on the conformational dynamics of the loop regions at the entry of the catalytic site. Studying, at atomic level, the characteristics of the active site and obtaining information on how the protein can interact with its substrates will allow the design of molecules able to block the enzymatic function crucial for the virus.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9Ani5k

medical,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed a huge challenge on the antenatal care of pregnant women worldwide, with the maternal mortality rate being raised to alarming levels. While COVID-19 vaccines were developed, some studies highlighted a possible relationship between influenza vaccination and lower odds of COVID-19 infection. As obstetric patients belong to a high-risk group for respiratory diseases, this study evaluated whether influenza vaccination reduces the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality among pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 3370 pregnant and postpartum women from the Brazilian national database, where they were grouped according to their influenza vaccination status before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The intensive care unit admission and intubation rates were significantly higher among subjects in the unvaccinated group (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively). The odds of mortality risk among those who received the vaccine was 0.33, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.23–0.47. The numbers of patients who needed to be vaccinated to avoid a case of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death due to COVID-19 were 11, 15, and 11, respectively.

medical,"Poor growth and/or weight gain was identified in the initial reports of children with AIDS (Oleske et al. 1983, Rubinstein et al. 1983). However, in the past 12 years little progress has been made to understand the mechanisms for these observations. Data from the NIAID/NICHD multicenter Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS) demonstrated that a decline in weight occurred in the first four months of life followed by decreased linear growth (Rich et al. 1993). In older children weight and height seem to decline in parallel (McKinney et al. 1993), but loss of lean body mass may occur prior to a decline in weight (Miller et al. 1993). Adequate caloric intake can improve weight gain, but has little effect on height velocity and lean body mass (Henderson et al. 1994, Miller et al. 1992). Long-term survivors with HIV infection are shorter than anticipated, and these changes cannot be explained solely by inadequate nutrition or by endocrine abnormalities.

medical,A little over a year ago I went to have some dental work done. Growing up I had not insurance and had been to a dentist once in my 26 years. Last year it had been nearly 18 years. They were amazed I did not have even worse problems. I was able to afford half the work I needed at the time which was 4 fillings. I had a tooth that had been worked on and after about a month developed a large infection. Face totally swelled up.  Went back and they had to cut into the gum to drain. She had removed the filling and refilled it. She never mentioned to me the need to come back in the near future. About a month later I was eating a baked potato chip and part of the tooth broke off and part of the filling came out. Months later I began to notice a foul smell in my mouth and noticed the rest of the filling was loose. I tugged it out and out came a bunch of cotton stuffing that was yellow and disgusting smelling. The filling was also this porous white material which smelt just awful as well.  Ive had this huge hole in my tooth for over a year now.

medical,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) managed with antibiotics, suffer morbidity, while society is burdened with significant costs and the rising specter of antibiotic resistance. We report a game-changing vaccine, MV140, for the prevention of rUTI in women. METHODS: The novel mechanism of action of MV140 is examined. Results from 1. early uncontrolled studies, 2. the first phase III multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (randomized women with rUTI to 6 months placebo or MV140 for 3 or 6 months with 12 months total follow-up), 3. ongoing safety monitoring from special access programs (SAP;2014-2020) and 4. the first in North America (NA) clinical experience evaluating the novel sublingual vaccine MV140 (Uromune) for prevention of rUTI in women are reported. Major endpoints for the reported clinical studies were number of UTIs, UTI-free rate and safety following 3 months vaccine administration. RESULTS: Stimulation of sublingual mucosa with MV140 (Uromune), a polybacterial sublingual vaccine consisting of whole inactivated bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, P. vulgaris) induces induction of a T-cell specific adaptive as well as innate immune response at the level of the genitourinary tract. In 5 uncontrolled studies 1,408 women treated with MV140 had significantly higher UTI-free rates (35 to 90%) than 499 women treated with antibiotic prophylaxis (0-9%). In the pivotal RCT (240 women randomized), the median number of UTI episodes for 9 months post-vaccination was 3.0 [IQR, 0.5-6.0] in placebo compared to 0.0 [IQR, 0.0-1.0] in both groups receiving MV140 (p <0.001). UTI-free rates of 55.7% and 58.0% were observed in subjects receiving MV140 for 3 or 6 months, respectively compared to 25.0% in placebo group (p <0.001). Only 5 (2 with placebo;3 with MV140) subjects reported non-serious adverse reactions (A/R). The ongoing SAP safety study documented A/R's in 1.7% of over 20,500 patients. Subjects enrolled in the NA study prior to pre-Covid-19 mandatory recruitment shutdown (n=25) experienced a 48% UTI-free rate (with overall 82% reduction in UTI episodes compared to pre-vaccination) in the 9 months following 3 month vaccination period with one subject having 2 mild vaccine associated A/Rs. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies confirm the theoretical benefits of MV140 vaccine as a safe and effective strategy to reduce the incidence and/or prevent rUTI in women. Physicians who treat rUTI and women who suffer from rUTI will soon have an evidence-based alternative to antibiotic management.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Q1hlgR

First, we look at growth in video traffic during the pandemic, using traffic logs from a global video conferencing provider. Second, we leverage a country-wide deployment of measurement probes to assess the performance of mobile networks during the outbreak. We find that the lockdown has visibly impacted almost all aspects of Internet performance. Access networks have experienced an increase in peak and off-peak end to end latency. Mobile networks exhibit significant changes in download speed, while certain types of video traffic has increased by an order of magnitude.

The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of pro-neuroinflammatory miRNAs, anti- neuroinflammatory miRNAs, and their mRNA targets in the serum of COVID-19 patients with different grades. Methods: COVID-19 patients with different grades were enrolled in this study and the expression of pro-neuroinflammatory miRNAs, anti-neuroinflammatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs was analyzed by q-PCR. Results: The relative expression of anti- neuroinflammatory miRNAs (mir-21, mir-124, and mir-146a) was decreased and the relative expression of their target mRNAs (IL-12p53, Stat3, and TRAF6) was increased. Also, the relative expression of pro-neuroinflammatory miRNAs (mir-326, mir-155, and mir-27b) was increased and the relative expression of their target mRNA (PPARS, SOCS1, and CEBPA) was decreased in COVID-19 patients with increase of disease grade. A negative significant correlation was seen between mir-21 and IL-12p53 mRNA, mir-124 and Stat3 mRNA, mir-146a and TRAF6 mRNA, mir-27b and PPARS mRNA, mir-155 and SOCS1 mRNA, and between mir-326 and CEBPA mRNA in COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: This study showed that the relative expression of anti- neuroinflammatory miRNAs was decreased and the relative expression of their targeted mRNAs was increased in COVID-19 patients from asymptomatic to critical illness.

medical,"A multi-disciplinary expert group met to discuss vitamin D deficiency in the UK and strategies for improving population intakes and status. Changes to UK Government advice since the 1st Rank Forum on Vitamin D (2009) were discussed, including rationale for setting a reference nutrient intake (10 µg/d; 400 IU/d) for adults and children (4+ years). Current UK data show inadequate intakes among all age groups and high prevalence of low vitamin D status among specific groups (e.g. pregnant women and adolescent males/females). Evidence of widespread deficiency within some minority ethnic groups, resulting in nutritional rickets (particularly among Black and South Asian infants), raised particular concern. Latest data indicate that UK population vitamin D intakes and status reamain relatively unchanged since Government recommendations changed in 2016. Vitamin D food fortification was discussed as a potential strategy to increase population intakes. Data from dose–response and dietary modelling studies indicate dairy products, bread, hens’ eggs and some meats as potential fortification vehicles. Vitamin D(3) appears more effective than vitamin D(2) for raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, which has implications for choice of fortificant. Other considerations for successful fortification strategies include: (i) need for ‘real-world’ cost information for use in modelling work; (ii) supportive food legislation; (iii) improved consumer and health professional understanding of vitamin D’s importance; (iv) clinical consequences of inadequate vitamin D status and (v) consistent communication of Government advice across health/social care professions, and via the food industry. These areas urgently require further research to enable universal improvement in vitamin D intakes and status in the UK population.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",unYr64

medical,"AIMS AND METHOD Depression in first-episode psychosis (FEP) is highly prevalent and associated with poor outcomes; it has become increasingly recognised and adopted in national and international guidelines for psychosis. Using a 26-item questionnaire, this study aimed to explore if this shift has led to greater recognition among UK psychiatrists, and more effective management of depression in FEP. RESULTS Of the 297 respondents, 54.4% observed depression occurring in chronic psychosis, with the least number of respondents (17.7%) identifying depression occurring frequently during FEP. Although there was reasonable agreement in the use of antidepressants as a first-line treatment for depression (70% prescribing antidepressants), there was uncertainty around assessing depression and delineating from psychosis symptoms, and particularly negative symptoms.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has engendered difficulties for health systems globally; however, the effect of the pandemic on emergency medicine (EM) residency training programs is unknown. The pandemic has caused reduced volumes of emergency department (ED) patients, except for those with COVID-19 infections, and this may reduce the case exposure of EM residents. The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical exposure of EM residents between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of EM resident physicians' training in a tertiary teaching hospital with two branch regional hospitals in Taiwan. We retrieved data regarding patients seen by EM residents in the ED between September 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Taiwan was reported on January 11, so the pandemic period in our study was defined as spanning from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. The number and characteristics of patients seen by residents were recorded. We compared the data between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: The mean number of patients per hour (PPH) seen by EM residents in the adult ED decreased in all three hospitals during the pandemic. The average PPH of critical area of medical ED was 1.68 in the pre-epidemic period and decreased to 1.33 in the epidemic period (p value < 0.001). The average number of patients managed by residents decreased from 1.24 to 0.82 in the trauma ED (p value = 0.01) and 1.56 to 0.51 in the pediatric ED (p value = 0.003) during the pandemic, respectively. The severity of patient illness did not change significantly between the periods. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic engendered a reduced ED volume and decreased EM residents' clinical exposure. All portion of EM residency training were affected by the pandemic, with pediatric EM being the most affected. The patient volume reduction may persist and in turn reduce patients' case exposure until the pandemic subsides. Adjustment of the training programs may be necessary and ancillary methods of learning should be used to ensure adequate EM residency training.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xrPcZ5

medical,"Introduction Vitamin D deficiency is a rising health issue in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It can lead to serious issues such as rickets, periodontitis, osteoporosis, weakness, muscle ache, and depression. This study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of patients with CKD in Pakistan and evaluate the correlation between serum vitamin D and renal function progression. Methodology A retrospective study enrolled patients who visited Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2015 to January 2021 with a primary diagnosis of CKD. Anthropometric, laboratory, and demographic data were collected from the hospital management information system (HMIS). Results A total of 513 patients with CKD were included in the study. More than 50% of the patients were from stage 3 to stage 5 of CKD while the rest were from stage 1 and stage 2. Significant differences are in relation to calcium, phosphate, and albumin across categories of severity of CKD. Calcium is lowest in stage 5 while phosphate is highest in stage 5. Vitamin D deficiency was found in all participants, but serum vitamin D concentration was lowest in stage 5, i.e., 8.14+6.00. The changing of vitamin D level was associated with the severity of CKD staging (p-value=0.003). Conclusion The current study has shown that vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia are more common in patients with CKD, but their severity is more common in advanced stages of CKD.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0RAZrX

medical,"BACKGROUND: Overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to laypersons are key approaches to reduce the incidence of opioid-involved overdoses. While some research has examined attitudes toward OEND, especially among pharmacists and first responders, our understanding of what laypersons believe about overdose and naloxone is surprisingly limited. Further, some scholars have expressed concerns about the prevalence of non-evidence-based beliefs about overdose and naloxone. We designed this study to analyze the prevalence, nature, and context of beliefs about naloxone and overdose among U.S. laypersons. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study (n = 702) using Prolific.co (representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, and race). Primary outcomes were the believability of six statements about overdose/naloxone on a seven-point Likert-type scale. Five statements were unsupported, and one was supported, by current scientific evidence. We used latent profile analysis to classify participants into belief groups, then used regression to study correlates of profile classification. RESULTS: Believability of the statements (7: extremely believable) ranged from m = 5.57 (SD = 1.38) for a scientifically supported idea (trained bystanders can reverse overdose with naloxone), to m = 3.33 (SD = 1.83) for a statement claiming opioid users can get high on naloxone. Participants were classified into three latent belief profiles: Profile 1 (most aligned with current evidence; n = 246), Profile 2 (moderately aligned; n = 351), and Profile 3 (least aligned, n = 105). Compared to Profile 1, several covariates were associated with categorization into Profiles 2 and 3, including lower trust in science (RRR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.24–0.54; RRR = 0.21, 95%CI = 0.12–0.36, respectively), conservative political orientation (RRR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.23–1.63; 3:RRR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.35–1.95, respectively), and never being trained about naloxone (Profile 3: RRR = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.16–9.77). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests some U.S. laypersons simultaneously believe that bystander overdose prevention with naloxone can prevent overdose and one or more scientifically unsupported claims about naloxone/overdose. Categorization into clusters displaying such belief patterns was associated with low trust in science, conservative political orientation, and not having been trained about naloxone.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressed patients, including individuals with organ transplantation, have been among susceptible groups with regard to COVID-19, on the other hand pediatric patients more commonly undergo a mild clinical course after acquiring COVID-19. To the best of the authors knowledge, to this date very little data exists on COVID-19 in a pediatric patient with liver transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a three year-old boy who had liver transplantation at 18 months old. He was admitted due to dyspnea with impression of acute respiratory distress syndrome and was then transferred to the intensive care unit. Chest X-ray at admission showed bilateral infiltration. Vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole and co-trimoxazole were started from the first day of admission. On day 4 of admission, with suspicion of COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and oseltamivir were added to the antibiotic regimen. PCR was positive for COVID-19. The patient developed multi-organ failure and died on day 6 of admission. CONCLUSIONS: For pediatric patients with organ transplantations, extreme caution should be taken, to limit and prevent their contact with COVID-19 during the outbreak, as these patients are highly susceptible to severe forms of the disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PHcOjw

medical,"The type I interferon (IFN) response is a strong and crucial moderator for the control of viral infections. The strength of this system is illustrated by the fact that, despite some temporary discomfort like a common cold or diarrhea, most viral infections will not cause major harm to the healthy immunocompetent host. To achieve this, the immune system is equipped with a wide array of pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent coordinated type I IFN response orchestrated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). The production of type I IFN subtypes by dendritic cells (DCs), but also other cells is crucial for the execution of many antiviral processes. Despite this coordinated response, morbidity and mortality are still common in viral disease due to the ability of viruses to exploit the weaknesses of the immune system. Viruses successfully evade immunity and infection can result in aberrant immune responses. However, these weaknesses also open opportunities for improvement via clinical interventions as can be seen in current vaccination and antiviral treatment programs. The application of IFNs, Toll‐like receptor ligands, DCs, and antiviral proteins is now being investigated to further limit viral infections. Unfortunately, a common threat during stimulation of immunity is the possible initiation or aggravation of autoimmunity. Also the translation from animal models to the human situation remains difficult. With a Strengths–Weaknesses–Opportunities–Threats (“SWOT”) analysis, we discuss the interaction between host and virus as well as (future) therapeutic options, related to the type I IFN system.

In the absence of containment measures, the epidemics spread exponentially fast whenever the infectivity rate is positive λ>0. The containment measures are modeled by considering a time-dependent modulation of the bare infectivity λ leading to effective infectivity that decays in time for each infected individual, mimicking, for instance, the combined effect of the asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies, and quarantine. We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for effective infectivity, and we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic threshold with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the exponential growth of newly infected individuals.

medical,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global crisis, urgently necessitating the development of safe, efficacious, convenient-to-store, and low-cost vaccine options. A major challenge is that the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-only vaccine fails to trigger long-lasting protective immunity if used solely for vaccination. To enhance antigen processing and cross-presentation in draining lymph nodes (DLNs), we developed an interferon (IFN)-armed RBD dimerized by immunoglobulin fragment (I-R-F). I-R-F efficiently directs immunity against RBD to DLN. A low dose of I-R-F induces not only high titer long-lasting neutralizing antibodies but also comprehensive T cell responses than RBD, and even provides comprehensive protection in one dose without adjuvant. This study shows that the I-R-F vaccine provides rapid and complete protection throughout upper and lower respiratory tracts against high dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Due to its potency and safety, this engineered vaccine may become one of the next-generation vaccine candidates in the global race to defeat COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",MD1FIP
medical,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the joint effect of H. pylori infection and tobacco smoking on the development of stomach cancer among Vietnamese men. METHODS: A total of 80 stomach cancer cases and 146 controls were recruited in a case-control study conducted in a general hospital. Information on sociodemographic, anthropometric characteristics, tobacco smoking, and the dietary pattern was obtained based on a semi-quantitative food frequency and demographic lifestyle questionnaire; and venous anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies were tested by ELISA. Unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounding was performed to estimate the association between target exposures and stomach cancer. RESULTS: An increase in antibody level was related to an elevated odds of stomach cancer (Fifth versus bottom quintile, OR=3.07; 95%CI: 1.16, 8.12; p for trend = 0.032). Compared to participants who were negative with both H. pylori infection and tobacco smoking (either cigarette or waterpipe tobacco), individuals exposed to both these factors showed significantly greater odds of stomach cancer (OR=3.58. (95%CI: 1.32, 9.76, p=0.013).

medical," Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension Sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension Familial primary pulmonary hypertension Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Primary pulmonary hypertension PPH Secondary pulmonary hypertension Cor pulmonale - pulmonary hypertension Summary Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. Causes The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Birth defects of the heart Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Heart valve disease HIV infection Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis or any other severe chronic lung condition Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom. Fast heart rate (palpitations) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest. Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdomen size Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find: Abnormal heart sounds Feeling of a pulse over the breastbone Heart murmur on the right side of the heart Larger-than-normal veins in the neck Leg swelling Liver and spleen swelling Normal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is idiopathic or due to congenital heart disease Abnormal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is from other lung disease In the early stages of the disease, the exam may be normal or almost normal. The condition may take several months to diagnose. Asthma and other diseases may cause similar symptoms and must be ruled out. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood tests Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Echocardiogram ECG Lung function tests Nuclear lung scan Pulmonary arteriogram 6-minute walk test Sleep study Tests to check for autoimmune problems Treatment There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH Oxygen therapy at home Lung, or in some cases, heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: Avoid pregnancy Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting Avoid traveling to high altitudes Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine Stop smoking Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on what caused the condition. Medicines for IPAH may help slow the disease. As the illness gets worse, you will need to make changes in your home to help you get around the house.

medical,"From August of 2011 to December of 2011, I lost 20 lbs, going from 125 to 105. In December of 2011 I started noticing extreme bloating and severe fullness after eating as if my food was not digesting, which would last the entire day and get worse as I ate more food throughout the day, only feeling better with long fasting(15+ hours). This has lasted until now. The past couple months, I ve had an endoscopy , a gastric emptying test, a small bowel barium x-ray , a upper right quadrant ultrasound, and a HIDA scan with CCK. All were normal except the HIDA scan. My gallbladder never appeared after 4 hours and they never injected the CCK. My GI doctor told me this may be what is causing at least some of my symptoms. I went to see a surgeon, who told me that my symptoms appear to be inconsistent with what he said were the only 2 reasons for results like mine, inflammation, and a gall stone blocking the duct(I asked about sludge and he said sludge usually shows up on an ultrasound). He said if that were the case, I would be in severe pain where my gallbladder is located. I am really looking for answers. All of my tests have come back normal except for the HIDA, and the surgeon doesn t seem to believe it. I am really worried and am looking for any information I can find. Although I am not a doctor, I ve read that gallbladder problems can FEEL as if your food is not digesting(although clinically I KNOW mine is digesting), and bloating and an unusual feeling of fullness can occur. I have also read that rapid weight loss can contribute to gallbladder issues. I guess what I m asking is, out of all these tests one comes back abnormal and the surgeon is not willing to accept it as abnormal, so MUST you feel severe pain as the doctor said for a test to come back the way mine did?

medical,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemics pose a great challenge to health care of patients. However, the impact of unprecedented situation of COVID‐19 outbreak on health care of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in real‐world setting has seldom been investigated. METHODS: We performed an observational study in a tertiary referral IBD center in China. The mode of health care and medication use was compared before and after COVID‐19 outbreak. Electronic questionnaire surveys were performed among gastroenterologists and IBD patients to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 outbreak on their attitudes towards telemedicine. RESULTS: COVID‐19 outbreak resulted in substantial decrease of patients participating in standard face‐to‐face visit during 1 month post‐outbreak (n = 51) than pre‐outbreak (n = 249), whereas the participation in telemedicine was significantly higher than comparable period in 2019 (414 vs 93). During the 1 month after COVID‐19 outbreak, 39 (39/56, 69.6%) patients had their infliximab infusion postponed with the mean delay of 3 weeks. The immunomodulator use was similar between pre‐outbreak and post‐outbreak. Six elective surgeries were postponed for a median of 43 days. In post‐outbreak period, 193 (193/297, 64.98%) of the surveyed physicians have used telemedicine with an increase of 18.9% compared with 46.13% (137/292) in the pre‐outbreak period (P < 0.001); 331 (331/505, 65.54%) of the surveyed IBD patients supported that the use of telemedicine should be increased in future health care. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 outbreak resulted in a great change in health‐care access among IBD patients including decrease in standard face‐to‐face visit and delay of biologics use. There was an increased use and need of telemedicine after COVID‐19 outbreak.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WnNF1Z

This study evaluates the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion using data from a large health system in the Bronx, New York. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2 cohorts of consecutive patients with emergent large-vessel occlusion admitted to 3 Montefiore Health System hospitals in the Bronx from January 1 to February 17, 2020, (prepandemic) and March 1 to April 17, 2020 (pandemic). We abstracted data from the electronic health records on presenting biomarker profiles, admission and postprocedural NIHSS scores, time of symptom onset, time of hospital presentation, time of start of the thrombectomy procedure, time of revascularization, presenting ASPECTS, TICI recanalization score, mRS, functional outcomes, and mortality. RESULTS: Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke during the study periods, 80 had emergent large-vessel occlusion, of whom 36 were in the pandemic group. Patients in the pandemic group were younger (66 versus 72 years, P < .061) and had lower ASPECTS (7 versus 9, P < .001) and took longer to arrive at the hospital (361 versus 152 minutes, P < .004) with no other major differences. There was a decreased rate of thrombolysis administration (22% versus 43%, P < .049) and a decreased number of patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (33% versus 61%, P < .013). CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic led to delays in patients arriving at hospitals, leading to decreased patients eligible for treatment, while in-hospital evaluation and treatment times remain unchanged.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GIgjLZ
medical,"With the rapid continuing spread of COVID-19, it is clearly important to be able to track the progress of the virus over time in order to be better prepared to anticipate its emergence and spread in new regions as well as declines in its presence in regions thereby leading to or justifying ""reopening"" decisions. There are many applications and web sites that monitor officially released numbers of cases which are likely to be the most accurate methods for tracking the progress of the virus;however, they will not necessarily paint a complete picture. To begin filling any gaps in official reports, we have developed the NewsStand CoronaViz web application (https://coronaviz.umiacs.io) that can run on desktops and mobile devices that allows users to explore the geographic spread in discussions about the virus through analysis of keyword prevalence in geotagged news articles and tweets in relation to the real spread of the virus as measured by confirmed case numbers reported by the appropriate authorities. NewsStand CoronaViz users have access to dynamic variants of the disease-related variables corresponding to the numbers of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries (where they are provided) via a map query interface. It has the ability to step forward and backward in time using both a variety of temporal window sizes (day, week, month, or combinations thereof) in addition to user-defined varying spatial window sizes specified by direct manipulation actions (e.g., pan, zoom, and hover) as well as textually (e.g., by the name of the containing country, state or province, or county as well as textually-specified spatially-adjacent combinations thereof), and finally by the amount of spatio-temporally-varying news and tweet volume involving COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tZhOf2

Independent variables were selected drawing upon key characteristics employed internationally in monetary transfers: age, gender, rural area, employment, family income, and education. The text identifies a statistically significant and negative relation between receiving the monetary transfer and two variables: family income and educational level. The need to increase coverage of the program is addressed as well as the importance of considering age, gender, rural areas, and employment as criteria for selecting the beneficiaries in such economic measures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6ot3jU

medical,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the histological and histomorphometric characteristics of post-extraction sites grafted with decellularized bovine compact bone from bovine femur, mixed and unmixed with leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin after four months of healing. This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial of parallel groups. Patients in need of a single, implant-supported restoration to replace a hopeless tooth were recruited for tooth extraction and implant placement four months after socket preservation procedure. After tooth extraction, patients were randomly allocated to receive decellularized bovine compact bone from bovine femur, mixed and unmixed with leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin. After four months of healing, tapered implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 35 and 45 Ncm. Two months later, implants were loaded with screw-retained definitive crowns. Outcome measures were implant (ISR) and prosthesis (PSR) survival rates, complications, histological and histomorphometric analyses, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, and patients’ satisfaction. Clinical data were collected up to one year after tooth extraction and socket preservation procedures. Thirty patients were consecutively enrolled in the trial (15 in each group). Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bone samples were collected only in 19 patients. Two implants failed before definitive prosthesis delivery (ISR 93.3%). No prosthesis failed (PSR 100%). Three complications were experienced in the control group. The mean bone percentage was 40.64 ± 18.76 in the test group and 33.40 ± 22.38 in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.4846). The mean soft tissue percentage was 32.55 ± 19.45 in the test group and 55.23 ± 17.64 in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0235). The mean residual graft was 24.59 ± 18.39 in the test group and 11.37 ± 12.12 in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0992). Mean marginal bone loss, as well as patient satisfaction, showed no differences between groups. With the limitations of the present study, socket preservation with L-PRF mixed with decellularized bovine compact bone demonstrated favorable results, comparing with decellularized bovine compact bone from bovine femur alone.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of hydroxychloroquine on the incidence of new respiratory infections in a large registry of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients compared with a matched cohort receiving other conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). METHODS: We reviewed physician-reported infections including upper respiratory infections (URI), bronchitis and pneumonia in the Corrona RA registry from June 2008 to February 2020 with the goal of comparing infections in biologic/targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARDs naive HCQ starts compared with starts of other csDMARDs and no HCQ. Patients on different interventions were compared using time-varying adjusted Cox models adjusting for age, sex, duration of RA, BMI, disease activity, smoking status, concurrent medications, season of the year, year of onset and history of serious infections, diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD). A secondary analysis in a set of propensity-matched starts were also compared adjusting for time-varying covariates. The analysis was repeated including URI and bronchitis only and also for serious respiratory infections only. RESULTS: No evidence of differences was found in the incidence of any respiratory infection (URI, bronchitis, pneumonia) in patients receiving HCQ compared with other csDMARDs: HR=0.87 (0.70 to1.07) in adjusted analyses and HR=0.90 (0.70 to 1.17) in adjusted matched analysis. Similar results were found in the analysis of URI and bronchitis only and for serious respiratory infections only. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RA, the risk for respiratory infections was similar among patients using HCQ as compared to other non-biologic DMARDs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lvc3_B

medical,"The COVID pandemic required significant changes in the provision of youth mental health services during the period of lockdown/stay at home orders. Things which were identified as changing significantly during this period included: service via telehealth; working from home, split teams (to reduce infection risk), and social (physical) distancing. An online survey of clinicians was conducted involving both closed and open ended questions. Service staff identified significant benefits from the changes to the way services were delivered as well as some impediments and challenges. Advantages in the new way of working revolved around the flexibility of the virtual service, with appointments online enabling families to more easily overcome issues of transport, work commitments, childcare and disruption to routines and timing. The online platforms also enabled some family members to participate who otherwise might not have been able to come to appointments in person. Disadvantages included where there were issues with availability and access to appropriate technology or private spaces, or when the young person was very young, very unwell, unstable, isolated or at higher risk.

medical,"In a dynamic data structure problem we wish to maintain an encoding of some data in memory, in such a way that we may efficiently carry out a sequence of queries and updates to the data. A long-standing open problem in this area is to prove an unconditional polynomial lower bound of a trade-off between the update time and the query time of an adaptive dynamic data structure computing some explicit function. Ko and Weinstein provided such lower bound for a restricted class of {\em semi-adaptive\/} data structures, which compute the Disjointness function. There, the data are subsets $x_1,\dots,x_k$ and $y$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, the updates can modify $y$ (by inserting and removing elements), and the queries are an index $i \in \{1,\dots,k\}$ (query $i$ should answer whether $x_i$ and $y$ are disjoint, i.e., it should compute the Disjointness function applied to $(x_i, y)$). The semi-adaptiveness places a restriction in how the data structure can be accessed in order to answer a query.

medical,"Since the first case reports in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and took lives of > 8,35,000 people globally. This single-stranded RNA virus uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into the host cell. Overexpression of ACE2 is mainly observed in hypertensive, diabetic and heart patients that make them prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mitigations strategies were opted globally by the governments to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the implementation of social distancing norms, wearing the facemasks, and spreading awareness using digital platforms. The lack of an approved drug treatment regimen, and non-availability of a vaccine, collectively posed a challenge for mankind to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this scenario, repurposing of existing drugs and old treatment options like convalescent plasma therapy can be one of the potential alternatives to treat the disease. The drug repurposing provides a selection of drugs based on the scientific rationale and with a shorter cycle of clinical trials, while plasma isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients can be a good source of neutralizing antibody to provide passive immunity. In this review, we provide in-depth analysis on these two approaches currently opted all around the world to treat COVID-19 patients. For this, we used “Boolean Operators” such as AND, OR & NOT to search relevant research articles/reviews from the PUBMED for the repurposed drugs and the convalescent plasma in the COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs like Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Tenofovir, Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Darunavir, Oseltamivir, Arbidol (Umifenovir), Favipiravir, Anakinra, and Baricitinib are already being used in clinical trials to treat the COVID-19 patients. These drugs have been approved for a different indication and belong to a diverse category such as anti-malarial/anti-parasitic, anti-retroviral/anti-viral, anti-cancer, or against rheumatoid arthritis. Although, the vaccine would be an ideal option for providing active immunity against the SARS-CoV-2, but considering the current situation, drug repurposing and convalescent plasma therapy and repurposed drugs are the most viable option against SARS-CoV-2.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, in December 2019. India has witnessed a massive surge of coronavirus cases. MAIN TEXT: This study details the measures to be taken by the clinicians involved in doing otorhinolaryngology and head neck surgery in light of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. All COVID-positive patients should be admitted in a separate COVID ward, and patients should be screened for COVID-19 before admission. Only emergent ENT surgeries should be done in an operating room having a negative pressure environment with high-frequency air changes, and all staff must wear personal protective equipment. The anesthetist intubates the patient while the surgical team waits outside the operation theater post-intubation for 21 min. For otology surgery, double draping of the microscope should be done; for rhinology surgery, concept of negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system should be used. Smoke evacuation system is set up inside the tent to evacuate any smoke produced during the surgery. Tracheostomy should be done at least after 10 days of mechanical ventilation with cuffed, non-fenestrated tracheal tube inserted through the tracheal window, and a separate closed suction system is used for suctioning. After the surgery is completed, disposal of PPE kit needs to be done according to local guidelines. After completion of the surgery, the full anesthesia unit should be disinfected for 2 h with 12 % hydrogen peroxide. Chlorine-containing disinfectant (2000 mg/L) is used to clean the floor of the operation theater and clean all the reusable medical equipment. Ultra-low volume 20 to 30 mL/m of 3% hydrogen peroxide is used to fumigate the OT for 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious disease. Measures need to be taken to prevent transmission and attain a plateau and decline in the disease. Otorhinolaryngologists and head neck surgeons are at high risk of this infection. This review summarizes the protocol for otorhinolaryngologists and head neck surgeons caring for patients in this current scenario. Protocols need to be strictly followed to prevent the spread of this disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",QHzssc

PAH pathogenesis mostly involves pulmonary arterial endothelial and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) dysfunction, leading to alterations in pulmonary arterial tone and distal pulmonary vessel obstruction and remodeling. Unfortunately, current PAH therapies are not curative, and therapeutic approaches mostly target endothelial dysfunction, while PASMC dysfunction is under investigation. In PAH, modifications in intracellular Ca(2+) homoeostasis could partly explain PASMC dysfunction. One of the most crucial actors regulating Ca(2+) homeostasis is store-operated Ca(2+) channels, which mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE).

medical,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma is frequently administered to patients with Covid-19 and has been reported, largely on the basis of observational data, to improve clinical outcomes. Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials. METHODS: We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death. RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200]. No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P = 0.46). Overall mortality was 10.96% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95% CI, -7.8 to 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.

medical,"Background and purpose: Ureteral stricture is a rare, but serious complication following ureteroscopy (URS) for stones. The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients ended up with a ureteral stricture after URS at our hospital and how these were treated. We also wanted to identify potential risk factors for post endoscopic stricture formation. Materials and methods: A retrospective evaluation of 1001 URS for stone treatment at the day-case surgery unit between 2013 - 2018 was performed. Data on pretreatment status, the surgical procedure and follow-up were recorded. Exact χ2 and independent-samples t-tests were used comparing data among those who developed strictures and those who did not. Multiple logistic regression was performed analyzing risk factors for stricture formation. Results: In total, 1001 URS were performed in 725 patients, 289 women and 436 men. Of these, 995 cases were eligible for analysis. At follow-up with computed tomography after 3 months, 28 (3.0%) strictures were identified. Of these, 20 received endourological treatment with balloon dilatation of which 15 (75%) were successful. Definitive treatment in the 13 patients with failed or unattempted endourological treatment included nephrectomy, reconstructive surgery, permanent nephrostomy or observation with no further treatment. In multiple regression analysis, use of access sheath (UAS) (OR 4.6, p = 0.011), ureteral perforation (OR 11.8, p < 0.0001) and surgical time > 60 minutes (OR 5.7, p < 0.005) were found to be risk factors for stricture formation. Conclusion: Ureteral stricture is a rare complication of URS. Balloon dilatation should be the first line of treatment. Use of UAS, perforation and excessive operating time were found to be risk factors for post endoscopic ureteral stricture formation. Special attention to these risk factors should be given to reduce the incidence of ureteral strictures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6NxlkJ

For children with disabilities and their families, such measures mean a lack of access to the resources they usually have through schools and habilitation or rehabilitation services. Health emergencies, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, require innovative strategies to ensure continuity of care. The objective of this perspective paper is to propose the adoption of two innovative strategies for teleintervention. Methods: The novel strategies include: (1) to apply the principles of the Routines-Based Model beyond the early years of development, and (2) to adopt My Abilities First—which is a novel educational tool promoting an abilities-oriented approach in healthcare encounters. Results: In the context of COVID-19, and using accessible language, the content of the paper highlights what is important for families and individuals with disabilities, and how the proposed novel strategies could be useful delivering remote support.

medical,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Intentional weight loss may reduce symptom severity of atrial fibrillation (AF) in relatively young AF patients with overweight. We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m2. Sixteen percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95%CI: 0.25 to 1.06) higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant change in state. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a -1.61 (95%CI: -2.72 to -0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total AF burden for a 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was 0.17 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.68). CONCLUSION BMI was positively associated with symptoms and negatively associated with one of the two measures of QoL, but not with the total AF burden. However, the strength of association was small and not clinically meaningful.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",y54xHx

medical,"INTRODUCTION Chronic postherniorrhaphy pain is the foremost setback of today's inguinal hernia repair. Finding predictors for it affects implants, operative techniques and allows for preventive measures. METHODS Prospectively collected data from 932 outpatient open inguinal hernia operations between 2003 and 2010 were subjected to regression analysis. Visual analogue scale score (VAS) at least a year after operation and a measurement of chronic pain at one year were the target variables. RESULTS Chronic pain was present in 99 (11.5%) patients one year after operation. Independent predictors for the occurrence of chronic pain were positively recurrence (Odds ratio, OR 6.77 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.005), complication (OR 5.16 vs. no complication, P = 0.002), mid-density mesh (OR 2.28 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.012), higher preoperative VAS score (OR 1.15, P = 0.006) and negatively higher age (OR 0.98, P = 0.027). Predictors for a higher postoperative VAS score were recurrence (regression coefficient, RC, 1.49 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.001), complication (RC 0.76 vs. no complication, P = 0.016), heavyweight mesh (RC 0.50 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.046) and higher preoperative VAS level (RC 0.10, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Recurrence, complication, mesh weight, preoperative VAS score and age are predictors for the occurrence chronic pain after open mesh based inguinal hernia repair. Recurrence, complication, mesh weight and preoperative VAS score are predictors of postherniorrhaphy VAS level.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4W_3CH

This study aims to investigate the willingness of Chinese adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and further explore the factors that may affect their willingness. We used a self-design anonymous questionnaire to conduct an online survey via the Sojump. A total of 1009 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 74. Among them, 609 (60.4%, 95%CI: 57.4-63.4%) were willing to receive the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Logistic regression analysis results showed that the age of 30-49 (OR = 2.042, 95%CI: 1.098-3.799), universities and colleges education (OR = 1.873, 95% CI = 1.016-3.451), master degree or above education (OR = 1.885, 95%CI = 1.367-2.599), previous influenza vaccination history (OR = 2.176, 95%CI: 1.474-3.211), trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine (OR = 6.419, 95%CI: 3.717-11.086), and close attention to the latest news of the vaccine (OR = 1.601, 95%CI: 1.046-2.449) were facilitative factors that affected their willingness to be vaccinated. More than half of the adults in China would be willing to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Middle-aged people with higher education, those who had been vaccinated against influenza, and those who believed that COVID-19 vaccine was effective and paid close attention to it were more willing to be vaccinated. Our findings can provide reference for the implementation of vaccination and the prevention of COVID-19 in China.

medical,"Mesocosms are real-world environmental science tools for bridging the gap between laboratory-scale experiments and actual habitat studies on ecosystem complexities. These experiments are increasingly being applied in understanding the complex impacts of heavy metals, ocean acidification, global warming, and oil spills. The insights of the present review indicate how metals and metal-bound activities impact on various aspects of ecological complexities like prey predator cues, growth, embryonic development, and reproduction. Plankton and benthos are used more often over fish and microbes owing to their smaller size, faster reproduction, amenability, and repeatability during mesocosm experiments. The results of ocean acidification reveal calcification of plankton, corals, alteration of pelagic structures, and plankton blooms. The subtle effect of oil spills is amplified on sediment microorganisms, primary producers, and crustaceans. An overview of the mesocosm designs over the years indicates that gradual changes have evolved in the type, size, design, composition, parameters, methodology employed, and the outputs obtained. Most of the pelagic and benthic mesocosm designs involve consideration of interactions within the water columns, between water and sediments, trophic levels, and nutrient rivalry. Mesocosm structures are built considering physical processes (tidal currents, turbulence, inner cycling of nutrients, thermal stratification, and mixing), biological complexities (population, community, and ecosystem) using appropriate filling containers, and sampling facilities that employ inert materials. The principle of design is easy transportation, mooring, deployment, and free floating structures besides addressing the unique ecosystem-based science problems. The evolution of the mesocosm tools helps in understanding further advancement of techniques and their applications in marine ecosystems.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",mwqLZ2

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the operation of donor human milk banks in various countries such as China, Italy and India. It is understandable that this impact on operations of donor human milk might hamper the capability of these milk banks to provide sufficient pasteurized donor milk to neonates who need it. Contrary to developed world, predominant donors in developing nations are mothers of hospitalised neonates who have a relatively long period of hospital stay. This longer maternal hospital stay enhances the feasibility of milk donation by providing mothers with access to breast pumps to express their milk. Any excess milk a mother expresses which is above the needs of their own infant can be voluntarily donated. This physical proximity of milk banks to donors may help continuation of human milk donation in developing nations during the pandemic. Nevertheless, protocols need to be implemented to i) ensure the microbiological quality of the milk collected and ii) consider steps to mitigate potential consequences related to the possibility of the donor being an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19. We present the procedural modifications implemented at the Comprehensive Lactation Management Centre at Lady Hardinge Medical College in India to promote breastfeeding and human milk donation during the pandemic which comply with International and National guidelines.

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the medical and social vulnerability of an unprecedented number of people. Consequently, there has never been a more important time for clinicians to engage patients in advance care planning (ACP) discussions about their goals, values, and preferences in the event of critical illness. An evidence-based communication tool-the Serious Illness Conversation Guide-was adapted to address COVID-related ACP challenges using a user-centered design process: convening relevant experts to propose initial guide adaptations; soliciting feedback from key clinical stakeholders from multiple disciplines and geographic regions; and iteratively testing language with patient actors. With feedback focused on sharing risk about COVID-19-related critical illness, recommendations for treatment decisions, and use of person-centered language, the team also developed conversation guides for inpatient and outpatient use. These tools consist of open-ended questions to elicit perception of risk, goals, and care preferences in the event of critical illness, and language to convey prognostic uncertainty. To support use of these tools, publicly available implementation materials were also developed for clinicians to effectively engage high-risk patients and overcome challenges related to the changed communication context, including video demonstrations, telehealth communication tips, and step-by-step approaches to identifying high-risk patients and documenting conversation findings in the electronic health record. Well-designed communication tools and implementation strategies can equip clinicians to foster connection with patients and promote shared decision making.

Thus, there has been a growing interest in exploring and developing novel drugs, natural or synthetic, that can manipulate our defence mechanism. Many of such studies, reported till date, have been designed to explore effect of the therapeutic on function of macrophages, being a key component in innate immune system. Indeed, RAW264.7, J774A.1, THP-1 and U937 cell lines act as ideal model systems for preliminary investigation and selection of dose for in vivo studies. Several bioassays have been standardized so far where many techniques require high throughput instruments, cost effective reagents and technical assistance that may hinder many scholars to perform a method demanding compilation of available protocols. In this review, we have taken an attempt for the first time to congregate commonly used in vitro immune-modulating techniques explaining their principles. The study detected that among about 40 different assays and more than 150 sets of primers, the methods of cell proliferation by MTT, phagocytosis by neutral red, NO detection by Griess reaction and estimation of expression of TLRs, COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β by PCR have been the most widely used to screen the therapeutics under investigation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",284kwX

medical,"BACKGROUND: During March and April 2020, reductions in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions were observed around the world. Elective surgeries, visits with general practitioners, and diagnoses of medical emergencies were consequently delayed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients’ mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively. The respective mean times from the onset of symptoms until admission were 3, 1, and 1.5 days, P < 0.001. The respective proportions of surgical interventions for appendiceal disease were 95%, 96%, and 69%; P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a routine period, patients during the COVID-19 outbreak waited longer before turning to hospitalization, and reported more pain at arrival. Patients during both emergency periods were more often treated surgically than non-operatively.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oJm5ZT

A prospective cohort study following the “Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology” (STROBE) guidelines was conducted, with two arms. Each multi-component intervention lasted for 18 weeks, and consisted of education on healthy habits, Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet)-based workshops, and a physical exercise program. Twenty-one middle-aged sedentary university employees with poor adherence to the MedDiet completed the study. Six months after completion of the intervention, both groups increased physical activity levels, adherence to the MedDiet, eating habits, health-promoting lifestyle, health responsibility, and health-related quality of life. There were no differences between groups in any of the variables analyzed. Therefore, remotely supervised physical exercise could be adequate to achieve long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle in the same way as conventional face-to-face intervention, at least in a population willing to change.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",hPMsD7

medical,"Naturally-occurring attenuated strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are being developed as vaccine vectors for use in poultry and humans. However, some NDV strains, such as Beaudette C (BC), may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use, and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic. We therefore modified the BC strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain LaSota. Additionally, the BC, F, and HN proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication. These modified BC-derived vectors and the LaSota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin (HA) protein of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV). In general, the modified BC-based vectors expressing HA replicated better than LaSota/HA, and expressed higher levels of HA protein. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens. Based on in vitro characterization, two of the modified BC vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against H5N1 HPAIV A/Vietnam/1203/04. Immunization of chickens with rNDV vector vaccines followed by challenge with HPAIV demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality. However, only those chickens immunized with modified BC/HA in which residues 271–330 from the F protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NDV AKO strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding. Our findings suggest that this modified rNDV can be used safely as a vaccine vector with enhanced replication, expression, and protective efficacy in avian species, and potentially in humans.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XK2GqV

medical,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a broad spectrum of brain ailments with short- and long-term disabilities, and nanomedicine-based approaches provide a new therapeutic approach to treating CNS disorders. A variety of potential drugs have been discovered to treat several neuronal disorders; however, their therapeutic success can be limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, unique immune functions within the CNS provide novel target mechanisms for the amelioration of CNS diseases. Recently, various therapeutic approaches have been applied to fight brain-related disorders, with moderate outcomes. Among the various therapeutic strategies, nanomedicine-based immunotherapeutic systems represent a new era that can deliver useful cargo with promising pharmacokinetics. These approaches exploit the molecular and cellular targeting of CNS disorders for enhanced safety, efficacy, and specificity. In this review, we focus on the efficacy of nanomedicines that utilize immunotherapy to combat CNS disorders. Furthermore, we detailed summarize nanomedicine-based pathways for CNS ailments that aim to deliver drugs across the BBB by mimicking innate immune actions.

The magnitude of such effects at the aggregate level in terms of the total travel time of all inhabitants of a country or state is likely limited. Such lasting effects imply that additional infrastructure extensions to reduce congestion on roads and crowding in public transport might have a lower benefit-cost ratio than would be the case without these impacts.

medical," Type 2 diabetes Noninsulin-dependent diabetes Diabetes - type II Adult-onset diabetes Diabetic - type 2 diabetes Oral hypoglycemic - type 2 diabetes High blood sugar - type 2 diabetes Summary Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Causes Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way. Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are not overweight or obese. This is more common in older adults. Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. Symptoms People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms at first. They may not have symptoms for many years. Early symptoms of diabetes caused by a high blood sugar level may include: Bladder, kidney, skin, or other infections that are more frequent or heal slowly Fatigue Hunger Increased thirst Increased urination Blurred vision After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, and as a result, many other symptoms. Exams and Tests Your doctor may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 11.1 mmol/L. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Fasting blood glucose level -- Diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) two different times. Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test -- Diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher. Oral glucose tolerance test -- Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a special sugar drink. Diabetes screening is recommended for: Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 years Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes Adults starting at age 45 every 3 years, or at a younger age if the person has risk factors If you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you need to work closely with your doctor. See your doctor as often as instructed. This may be every 3 months. The following exams and tests will help you and your doctor monitor your diabetes and prevent problems. Check the skin, nerves, and joints of your feet and legs. Check if your feet are getting numb (diabetic nerve disease). Have your blood pressure checked at least once a year (blood pressure goal should be 140/80 mm Hg or lower). Have your A1C tested every 6 months if your diabetes is well controlled. Have the test every 3 months if your diabetes is not well controlled. Have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked once a year. Get tests once a year to make sure your kidneys are working well (microalbuminuria and serum creatinine). Visit your eye doctor at least once a year, or more often if you have signs of diabetic eye disease. See the dentist every 6 months for a thorough dental cleaning and exam. Make sure your dentist and hygienist know that you have diabetes. Your provider may want to check your vitamin B12 blood levels if you are taking the drug metformin. Treatment At first, the goal of treatment is to lower your high blood glucose level. Long-term goals are to prevent complications. These are health problems that can result from having diabetes. The most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is by being active and eating healthy foods. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your doctor about seeing a diabetes nurse educator and a dietitian. LEARN THESE SKILLS Learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include: How to test and record your blood glucose What, when, and how much to eat How to safely increase your activity and control your weight How to take medicines, if needed How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar How to handle sick days Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments. Make sure you are getting information from trustworthy sources, such as your doctor and diabetes educator. MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR Checking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check. To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle, called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar. Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind: Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day. If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week. You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime. You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress. You may need to test more often if you are having more frequent low blood sugar symptoms. Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. Your doctor may recommend that you use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to measure blood sugar if: You are using insulin injections many times a day You have had an episode of severe low blood sugar Your blood sugar level varies a lot The CGM has a sensor that is inserted just under the skin to measure glucose in your tissue fluid every 5 minutes. HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL Work closely with your health care providers to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like. Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes. Obese people whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Regular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it: Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight Improves blood flow and blood pressure Increases your energy level Improves your ability to handle stress Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise, including adjusting doses of insulin if needed. MEDICINES TO TREAT DIABETES If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medicine. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar level in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug. Some of the most common types of medicines are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors Biguanides Bile acid sequestrants DPP-4 inhibitors Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs) Meglitinides SGLT2 inhibitors Sulfonylureas Thiazolidinediones You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys the insulin. PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including: Eye disease Kidney disease Heart disease and stroke FOOT CARE People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection. Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected. To prevent problems with your feet: Stop smoking if you smoke. Improve control of your blood sugar. Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year to learn if you have nerve damage. Ask your doctor to check your feet for problems such as a bunion or hammertoe. These need to be treated to prevent skin breakdown and ulcers. Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems. Treat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away. Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin. Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you. EMOTIONAL HEALTH Living with diabetes can be stressful. You may feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do to manage your diabetes. But taking care of your emotional health is just as important as your physical health. Ways to relieve stress include: Listening to relaxing music Meditating to take your mind off your worries Deep breathing to help relieve physical tension Doing yoga, taichi, or progressive relaxation Feeling sad or down (depressed) or anxious sometimes is normal. But if you have these feelings often and they're getting in the way of managing your diabetes, talk with your health care team. They can find ways to help you feel better. Support Groups There are many diabetes resources that can help you understand more about type 2 diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your condition so you can live well with diabetes. Outlook (Prognosis) Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure. Some people with type 2 diabetes no longer need medicine if they lose weight and become more active. When they reach their ideal weight, their body's own insulin and a healthy diet can control their blood sugar level. Possible Complications After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems: You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind. Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. If the wounds do not heal properly, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infections can also cause pain and itching in the skin. Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet. Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness. Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection. High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call 911 right away if you have: Chest pain or pressure Fainting, confusion or unconsciousness Seizure Shortness of breath These symptoms can quickly get worse and become emergency conditions (such as seizures, hypoglycemic coma or hyperglycemic coma). Also call your doctor if you have: Numbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legs Problems with your eyesight Sores or infections on your feet Symptoms of high blood sugar (extreme thirst, blurry vision, dry skin, weakness or fatigue, the need to urinate a lot) Symptoms of low blood sugar (weakness or fatigue, trembling, sweating, irritability, trouble thinking clearly, fast heartbeat, double or blurry vision, uneasy feeling) Frequent feelings of depression or anxiety Prevention You can help prevent type 2 diabetes by staying at a healthy body weight. You can get to a healthy weight by eating healthy foods, controlling your portion sizes, and leading an active lifestyle. Some medicines can also delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk of developing the disease.

medical,"Objetivo: Analisar a noção de autocuidado e ações adotadas por trabalhadoras sexuais no enfretamento e prevenção à COVID-19. Método: Estudo descritivo, qualitativo, apoiado na teoria de Enfermagem do Autocuidado. Realizou-se entrevista em profundidade com 30 trabalhadoras sexuais, do Alto Sertão Produtivo Baiano, entre os meses de setembro e outubro de 2020. As respostas foram submetidas à análise de conteúdo semântica/lexical possibilitada pelo software IRAMUTEQ. Resultados: Evidenciou-se quatro classes temáticas que revelaram como elas entendem o autocuidado e o implementa no seu cotidiano: o autocuidado como meio de ter bem-estar e qualidade de vida;valorização do dinheiro como um meio para fazer autocuidado;a tentativa de se proceder com a prevenção à COVID, ainda que seja difícil para muitas;consideração de que o cuidado si perpassa pelo cuidado com os outros. Conclusão: Para as participantes o autocuidado envolve o cuidado consigo mesma para a prevenção da COVID-19 e o cuidado com outro (familiares ou colegas de trabalho). Entretanto, o dinheiro obtido por meio do serviço sexual, constitui-se um facilitador para adoção do autocuidado, visto que há a negligência do Estado quanto ao atendimento às demandas e necessidades desse grupo social vulnerável.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZjOaWz

medical,"This study investigates the role of consumer–brand congruence and consumer–celebrity congruence in the formation of consumer attitudes toward brands and their impact on behavioral intentions within the context of corporate social advocacy (CSA) involving controversial celebrities. Using a U.S. sample drawn from a Qualtrics panel (N = 372), the results of mediation analyses indicate that attitude toward a brand positively mediates the effects of consumer–brand congruence on consumers’ behavioral intentions, including purchase intention, brand preference, and boycott recommendation. The consumer–celebrity congruence moderated the indirect effect of consumer–brand congruence on brand preference and boycott recommendations, but not purchase intention. The findings of this study contribute to the CSA literature and practices by highlighting the role of consumers’ congruence with a controversial celebrity in determining consumers’ behavioral responses to CSA. When brands practice CSA, consumer–brand congruence rather than consumer–celebrity congruence could play a more important role in shaping consumer behaviors.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-dsW7Z

Our legal analysis suggests that although international law provides states with the option of declaring an SOE and derogating from human rights obligations to ensure the life of the nation, other ways to handle the pandemic without declaring an SOE do exist Our theoretical analysis leads to three main propositions centred on the impact of regional diffusion, democratic institutions, and pandemic preparedness Our empirical analysis combines a range of quantitative data sources to analyse the SOE decisions of 180 states during the first half of 2020 The results suggest that states’ declarations of SOEs are driven by both external and internal factors A permissive regional environment, characterised by many simultaneously declared SOEs, may reduce the reputational and political costs of emergency powers, making their employment more palatable At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, have shaped governments’ decisions Weak democracies with poor preparedness have been considerably more likely to opt for an SOE than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xeJWkv

medical,"The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenic CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the mucosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadenitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats.

medical,"Using customized panel data spanning the entire year of 2020, we analyze the dynamics of working hours and household income across different stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to many other countries, during this period the Netherlands experienced a quick spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, adopted a set of fairly strict social distancing measures, gradually reopened, and imposed another lockdown to contain the second wave. We show that socio-economic status is strongly related to changes in working hours, especially when strict economic restrictions are in place. In contrast, household income is equally unaffected for all socio-economic groups. Examining the drivers of these observations, we find that pandemic-specific job characteristics (the ability to work from home and essential worker status) help explain the socio-economic gradient in total working hours. Household income is largely decoupled from shocks to working hours for employees. We provide suggestive evidence that large-scale labor hoarding schemes have helped insure employees against shocks to their employees.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UeMYRe
medical,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3–12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8–15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

medical,"To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 191 patients with COVID-19 were recruited at the Third Hospital of Wuhan from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Fifty healthy volunteers were randomly selected as the control group. Age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), CRP, lymphocyte percentage, and NLR were extracted. Quantitative clinical characteristics and laboratory values were compared between groups. Risk factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for COVID-19 were analyzed. We found that the NLR and CRP were higher, while the lymphocyte percentage was lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy controls. Among patients confirmed to have COVID-19, the NLR and CRP of the moderate group were lower than those of severely ill patients (severe, critical and death groups), and the lymphocyte percentage of the moderate group was higher than that of the critical and death group. There were no significant differences in WBC among all groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR, CRP, and lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors for COVID-19. The AUC of the combined determination of NLR and CRP was 0.863, which was higher than that of NLR, CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.835, 0.775, 0.416, and 0.749, respectively).

medical,"INTRODUCTION Rising rates of antibiotic resistance prompted a review of antibiotic use policies hospitalwide. The Department of Haematology established a new set of consensus guidelines in 2002 for antibiotic use in febrile neutropenia. The aim of our study was to audit adherence to the guidelines established for febrile neutropenia in patients treated for haematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS An antibiotic escalation pathway was developed by haematologists and infectious disease physicians. Adherence to the guidelines was audited. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) who had febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy were reviewed. The audit was performed by a retrospective review of casenotes. RESULTS Forty patients with 100 episodes of febrile neutropenia were surveyed. Thirty-two had AML, 7 had ALL and 1 had undifferentiated leukaemia. In 76% of episodes, fever developed within the first 14 days of neutropenia. In 31 episodes, cefepime was started as the first-line agent; hence, compliance with the first-line agent was 31%. Fever defervesced in 13 episodes. The most common reason for switching antibiotics was persistent fever. There were clinical indications for non-compliance with the use of the first-line agent in all cases. There were 3 deaths - none related to non-compliance with or strict adherence to the guidelines. Four patients had proven fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS Given the complex nature of the cases, compliance was reasonable, as there were valid reasons in all cases where the guidelines were not adhered to.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is an international concern as it spreads through human populations and across national and international borders. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we consecutively included all cancer patients who had been identified as having a nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 from two designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients without cancer were also enrolled for comparison. The clinical data were gathered from the medical records from Jan 14 to March 12, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 117 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the median age was 63 years and 48.7% were male. Male sex, hematologic cancer, dyspnea on admission, and anti-cancer therapies were associated with an increased risk of mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. We found that elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 were associated with a poorer prognosis in cancer patients with COVID-19, but no statistically significant association was found in patients without cancer. In addition, IL-2R and IL-6 markedly decreased in cancer patients who recovered from COVID-19. However, lymphocyte subsets were diminished in cancer patients who died from COVID-19, including total T cells, total B cells, helper T (Th) cells and suppressor T (Ts) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients with COVID-19 were associated with high mortality (23.9%). A decrease in lymphocyte subsets and higher levels of cytokines were associated with a higher risk of severe outcome and could be utilized as the reference index to predict the survival outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vdIZwe
medical,"This paper explores the immediate reaction of the EU and its Member States to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe in terms of trade restrictions. Almost all Member States adopted export control measures on personal protective equipment (PPE) essential to combat the pandemic in order to preserve it for the domestic market. The trade barriers affected the intra-EU trade as well as the external trade with third countries. The article explores whether and to what extent these restrictive measures on exports within the internal market may be justified on grounds of the protection of health and life of humans, as allowed by Article 36 TFEU. It will be argued that the consolidated case law justifying a Member State facing health emergencies to adopt restrictive measures to protect the population on its territory is not suitable in case of pandemics. The degree of market integration and the rising concept of health solidarity as an EU objective allow a different interpretation of the health exception assuming as a term of reference the whole EU population. The article further analyzes the export authorization scheme adopted by the Commission to allow restrictions on exports of PPE to third countries in case of shortages in essential goods in the Union. The article concludes by suggesting a preventive EU mechanism of control of intra-EU export restrictions in case of serious cross-border threats to health, similar to the export authorization scheme for extra EU exports, in order to avoid unilateral and disjointed responses by the Member States in the future.[enter Abstract Body]",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",qdSW9I

The case group consisted of 72 males and 28 females. 40 healthy adults without any history or clinical evidence suggestive of COVID-19 and without any comorbidities, like diabetes, hypertension chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, cancer, and immune-compromised individuals were considered as a control group for the study. Routine laboratory findings of these 100 patients were used to evaluate the abnormalities found in COVID-19 patients. Statistical analysis was carried out on the data after determining whether the data had a normal/log-normal distribution and their significance was determined by calculating the p-value. The percentage of patients showing a decrease or increase from the normal value was calculated. Trend analysis was carried out for the 100 patients considered in the case group. Among them, 6 patients were used as representatives to show the trend in these biomarkers during the course of hospital stay. These 5 severe cases consisted of 2 adult males, 2 adult females, and 1 adolescent girl. This selection is to demonstrate the representation of COVID-19 infection in adult males and females and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in the younger age group. One mild case (adult male) was also selected in the case study. We found a significant increase in mean values of AST, ALT, Total Billirubin, Creatinine, CRP, PCT, LDH, IL6, Ferritin, Lactate, hsTroponin I, NT Pro BNP and decrease in mean values of Albumin, SO2, and PO2 in COVID 19 cases than control.

medical,"PURPOSE: Current direct-acting antiviral agents for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 4a (HCV-4a) have been reported to cause adverse effects, and therefore less toxic antivirals are needed. This study investigated the role of curcumin chitosan (CuCs) nanocomposite as a potential anti-HCV-4a agent in human hepatoma cells Huh7. METHODS: Docking of curcumin and CuCs nanocomposite and binding energy calculations were carried out. Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and CuCs nanocomposite were prepared with an ionic gelation method and characterized with TEM, zeta size and potential, and HPLC to calculate encapsulation efficiency. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on Huh7 cells using MTT assay and confirmed with cellular and molecular assays. Anti-HCV-4a activity was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The strength of binding interactions between protein ligand complexes gave scores with NS3 protease, NS5A polymerase, and NS5B polymerase of -124.91, -159.02, and -129.16, for curcumin respectively, and -68.51, -54.52, and -157.63 for CuCs nanocomposite, respectively. CuCs nanocomposite was prepared at sizes 29–39.5 nm and charges of 33 mV. HPLC detected 4% of curcumin encapsulated into CsNPs. IC50 was 8 µg/mL for curcumin and 25 µg/mL for the nanocomposite on Huh7 but was 25.8 µg/mL and 34 µg/mL on WISH cells. CsNPs had no cytotoxic effect on tested cell lines. Apoptotic genes’ expression revealed the caspase-dependent pathway mechanism. CsNPs and CuCs nanocomposite demonstrated 100% inhibition of viral entry and replication, which was confirmed with HCV core protein expression. CONCLUSION: CuCs nanocomposite inhibited HCV-4a entry and replication compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role as an effective therapeutic agent.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",hMlqAn

Multivariate logistic regression identified 8 independent predictors of ICU admission that were included in the clinical score: hospitalization (OR, 1.079; 95% CI, 1.058 - 1.100), absolute lymphocyte count (OR, 0.526; 95%CI, 0.379- 0.729), C-reactive protein (OR, 1.009; 95%CI, 1.006-1.011), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.0008; 95%CI, 1.0004-1.0012), CURB-65 score (OR, 2.666; 95%CI, 2.212-3.213), chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 70 (OR, 0.249; 95%CI, 0.155-0.402), shortness of breath (OR, 3.494; 95%CI, 2.528-6.168), and bilateral infiltrates in chest radiography (OR, 6.335; 95%CI, 3.427-11.713). The mean of area under a curve (AUC) from the development cohort was 0.86 (95%CI, 0.85-0.87) and of the validation cohort was 0.85 (95%CI, 0.82-0.88). CONCLUSION: We provided a web application for identifying potential admittance in an ICU for COVID-19 case by clinical risk score based on 8 significant characteristics of patient (http://3.14.27.202/cov19-icu-score/).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",X8DFLQ

A very narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition was observed in the serum from individuals who later contracted H1N1 infection. Moreover, the pandemic influenza infection generated IgG reactivity to two adjacent epitopes of the neuraminidase protein. The differential serum IgG recognition was focused on haemagglutinin 1 (H1) and restricted to classical antigenic sites (Cb) in both the vaccinated controls and individuals with flu infections. We further identified a novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL on the Ca antigenic site (251–265) of the pandemic flu haemagglutinin, which was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals with previous vaccinations and never in serum from individuals with H1N1 infection (confirmed by RNA PCR analysis from nasal swabs). This epitope was mapped to the receptor-binding domain of the influenza haemagglutinin and could serve as a correlate of immune protection in the context of pandemic flu. The study shows that unbiased epitope mapping using peptide microarray technology leads to the identification of biologically and clinically relevant target structures. Most significantly an H1N1 infection induced a different footprint of IgG epitope recognition patterns compared with the pandemic H1N1 vaccine.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HwpafL

Description Randomisation en 3 bras (pas d’accès à la plateforme [G1], accès sans [G2] et avec [G3] fonctionnalités communautaires). Les patients complètent 3 questionnaires en ligne (M0 conditionnant l’inclusion, M9, M18). Méthodes Critère de jugement principal : différence des coûts rapportés à la différence de survie ajustée à la qualité de vie. Critères secondaires : bénéfices cliniques (survie à M18, observance), effet sur l’organisation des soins (appels au service, passages aux urgences, événements indésirables évités), analyse des coûts et conséquences de l’intervention. Résultats Entre 05/2018 et 12/2020, 815 patients ont été randomisés et 539 inclus (G1=180, G2=189, G3=170), dont 78 au stade 5, 67 dialysés et 394 transplantés. Au 01/06/2021, 433 patients ont complété M9 et 323 M18. Les premiers résultats indiquent des freins à l’inclusion liés aux médecins (difficulté de toute étude clinique), aux patients (non-remplissage à M0) et à des problèmes techniques (logiciel ePro). L’utilisation de la plateforme a fortement augmenté en 2020, en particulier lors de la première vague épidémique de COVID-19, validant son intérêt comme outil d’information pour les centres participants. De nombreux « likes », commentaires et questions sur les forums ont permis de mieux comprendre les préoccupations des patients durant la crise sanitaire et validé l’utilité des fonctions sociales. Chiffres clefs d’utilisation de la plateforme pour l’année 2020 : 20 787 pages lues, 4657 téléchargements et jeux-tests joués plus de 1000 fois.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: In addition to physical damage, COVID-19 also has a serious impact on the mental health of society. For many people, this involves the necessity of adapting to new conditions, uncertainty about the future and a tremendous mental burden. It was investigated whether there were any differences between the 2 measures (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) in the levels of perceived stress, anxiety, life satisfaction and experienced emotions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study, conducted in Poland and the Netherlands, involved 168 people. The metric, the Positive and Negative Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were used. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-immigrants living in Poland (N = 50), Dutch citizens (N = 56), and Polish immigrants living in the Netherlands (N = 62). RESULTS: The level of stress and negative emotions was higher in the groups of Poles living in Poland and Poles living in the Netherlands than in the group of Dutch citizens. Therefore, access to psychological care should be improved during the pandemic, especially for immigrants, due to the increased risk of developing stress-induced mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In the groups of Poles, there was an increase in perceived stress and trait anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of Dutch citizens experienced a reduction in the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group of Polish immigrants, there was an increase in life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, regulatory focus related to responses to the COVID-19 threat.

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the airline industry. Air travel in the United States declined in 2020 with significantly lower domestic and international flights. The dynamic change and uncertainty in the trend of COVID-19 have made it difficult to predict future air travel. This paper aims at developing and testing neural network models that predict domestic and international air travel in the medium and long term based on residents' daily trips by distance, economic condition, COVID-19 severity, and travel restrictions. Data in the United States from various sources were used to train and validate the neural network models, and Monte Carlo simulations were constructed to predict air travel under uncertainty of the pandemic and economic growth. The results show that weekly economic index (WEI) is the most important predictor for air travel. Additionally, daily trips by distance play a more important role in the prediction of domestic air travel than the international one, while travel restrictions seem to have an impact on both. Sensitivity analysis results for four different scenarios indicate that air travel in the future is more sensitive to the change in WEI than the changes in COVID-19 variables. Additionally, even in the best-case scenario, when the pandemic is over and the economy is back to normal, it still takes several years for air travel to return to normal, as before the pandemic. The findings have significant contributions to the literature in COVID-19's impact on air transportation and air travel prediction.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",l6z4nf

medical,"BACKGROUND: Although with exceptions, evidence seems to indicate that children have lower susceptibility than adults to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",mqMU5R

medical,"The present study investigated ultraviolet-induced in situ gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coupled with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the point-of-care testing (POCT) of two major infectious pathogens, namely, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium spp.). In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg µL-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection.

medical,"The Hopi Tribe is a sovereign nation home to ~7500 Hopi persons living primarily in 12 remote villages. The Hopi Tribe, like many other American Indian nations, has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. On 18 May 2020, a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed on the request of the tribe in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Collaborating with Hopi Health Care Center (the reservation's federally run Indian Health Service health facility) and CDC, the Hopi strengthened public health systems and response capacity from May to August including: (1) implementing routine COVID-19 surveillance reporting; (2) establishing the Hopi Incident Management Authority for rapid coordination and implementation of response activities across partners; (3) implementing a community surveillance programme to facilitate early case detection and educate communities on COVID-19 prevention; and (4) applying innovative communication strategies to encourage mask wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing. These efforts, as well as community adherence to mitigation measures, helped to drive down cases in August. As cases increased in September-November, the improved capacity gained during the first wave of the pandemic enabled the Hopi leadership to have real-time awareness of the changing epidemiological landscape. This prompted rapid response coordination, swift scale up of health communications and redeployment of the community surveillance programme. The Hopi experience in strengthening their public health systems to better confront COVID-19 may be informative to other indigenous peoples as they also respond to COVID-19 within the context of disproportionate burden.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",YoacH7
medical,"OBJECTIVE To study the pharmacological mechanism of Guanxin II formula (II) for treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OB⩾30%, DL⩾0.18, and HL ⩾4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD. CONCLUSION This network pharmacology-based exploration revealed that GX II might prevent and inhibit the primary pathological processes of CHD.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",G7rYaN

medical,"Background This study aimed to measure the levels of anxiety and burnout among healthcare workers, including attending physicians, residents, and nurses, in intensive care units during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods This is a cross-sectional survey analysis of healthcare workers in our institution. Data were collected on demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms and test, disease status, anxiety level (assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory), and burnout level (measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory). Subscales of the burnout inventory were evaluated separately. Results A total of 104 participants completed the survey. Attending physicians, residents, and nurses constituted 25%, 33.7%, and 41.3% of the cohort, respectively. In comparison to untested participants, those tested for COVID-19 had a lower mean age (p = 0.02), higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores (p = 0.001, 0.004, respectively), and lower personal accomplishment scores (p = 0.004). Furthermore, moderate to severe anxiety was observed more frequently in tested participants than untested ones (p = 0.022). Moderate or severe anxiety was seen in 23.1% of the attending physicians, 54.3% of the residents, and 48.8% of the nurses (p = 0.038). Emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and depersonalization scores differed depending on the position of the healthcare workers (p = 0.034, 0.001, 0.004, respectively). Conclusion This study revealed higher levels of anxiety and burnout in younger healthcare workers and those tested for COVID-19, which mainly included residents and nurses. The reasons for these observations should be further investigated to protect their mental health.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FQ3k7a

medical,"Robots are more and more present in our lives, particularly in the health sector. In therapeutic centers, some therapists are beginning to explore various tools like video games, Internet exchanges, and robot-assisted therapy. These tools will be at the disposal of these professionals as additional resources that can support them to assist their patients intuitively and remotely. The humanoid robot can capture young children’s attention and then attract the attention of researchers. It can be considered as a play partner and can directly interact with children or without a third party’s presence. It can equally perform repetitive tasks that humans cannot achieve in the same way. Moreover, humanoid robots can assist a therapist by allowing him to teleoperated and interact from a distance. In this context, our research focuses on robot-assisted therapy and introduces a humanoid social robot in a pediatric hospital care unit. That will be performed by analyzing many aspects of the child’s behavior, such as verbal interactions, gestures and facial expressions, etc. Consequently, the robot can reproduce consistent experiences and actions for children with communication capacity restrictions. This work is done by applying a novel approach based on deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms supported by an ontological knowledge base that contains relevant information and knowledge about patients, screening tests, and therapies. In this study, we realized a humanoid robot that will assist a therapist by equipping the robot NAO: 1) to detect whether a child is autistic or not using a convolutional neural network, 2) to recommend a set of therapies based on a selection algorithm using a correspondence matrix between screening test and therapies, and 2) to assist and monitor autistic children by executing tasks that require those therapies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6PfhRx

medical,"Retention of postgraduate students is a complex problem at higher education institutions. To address this concern, various forms of academic support are offered by higher education institutions to nurture and develop the pipeline of postgraduate students. The support provided to postgraduate students tends to emphasize academic support at times at the expense of psychosocial or non-academic support. Non-cognitive skills were underscored as integral to determining academic and employment outcomes and thus, may need to be investigated more. This manuscript reports on an attempt to filter and consolidate the literature reporting on interventions for postgraduate students that include the development of non-cognitive skills. A systematic review was conducted, because it enabled rigorous and replicable process of consolidating literature. Covidence software was used as a digital platform for the systematic review. The review was conducted at four levels as per the PRISMA guideline namely, identification, screening, eligibility and final summation. The filtration process attempted to answer the following research questions: (1) How are non-cognitive factors or skills defined? (2) Which non-cognitive skills were included in support for postgraduate (Masters and Doctoral) students in the higher education setting?, and (3) How have non-cognitive skills been included in support interventions provided to retain postgraduate students? Descriptive and theory explicative metasynthesis was used for the summation and data extraction. The primary finding was that the term non-cognitive was not used explicitly in the included studies to describe skills or factors supporting student retention. The discourse centered around support and social support as non-academic factors and skills. This suggested that non-cognitive skills were constructed as co-curricular and not integrated into the postgraduate academic project or core learning outcomes. The findings highlighted the distinction between non-cognitive skills and factors and illustrated how skills and factors operate at different levels with different spheres of influence. The formats of support provide an intersectional space where skills and factors are combined.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",m4PcjM

medical,"How can we investigate something so indeterminate, unpredictable and enormous, as the current Covid-19 pandemic? We apply Karen Barad’s relational ontology to illuminate some current dilemmas in research, where different forces, concepts and theories conflict with one another in multiple and complex ways. Barad’s views, we argue, may help to address potential dilemmas of accountability, for instance of accounting research(ers) as they research the Covid-19 pandemic. In what Barad calls ‘intra-action’, the research apparatus, the researched phenomena,andthe research results, constitute a complex system of relatedness. In ‘intra-action’ these elements never fully melt into one another, but rather, retain their ontological individuality. The research apparatus creates ‘real’ effects, but these can only be partially observed and disentangled. Which elements intra-act as the research progresses is the product of so-called ‘agential cuts’. We have researched the Covid-19 pandemic via what Barad would call a (small-scale) ‘experiment’. We have focused on air travel and more specifically on American Airlines: a hyperobject or social-economic object so complex and powerful that it cannot be captured in any single definition or analysis. Among others, we take guidance from Albert Camus’ The Plague in our analysis, concluding that AA (as a hyperobject) cannot really meet the research(ers) halfway, as Barad would call for. This is because the mutuality of ‘intra-action’, that is demanded is foreclosed. Consequently, while we believe that Barad’s views hold great merit for accounting research in the current crisis, we suggest that they raise deeply troubling dilemmas as well.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FaP4xW

medical,"AIM: COVID19 produced a unique challenge to the management of hand trauma. There was reduced theatre capacity and inpatient beds as staff and resources were lost to make way for the critically unwell(1), however the burden of patients (albeit reduced) requiring emergency procedures remained(2). During 1(st)UK peak we adopted a one-stop hand trauma clinic where patients were assessed by senior surgeons and immediately operated on under local anaesthesia with Adrenalin, a model mirrored by other units across the UK during this time(3,4). Subsequent to surgery they were either seen on the same day for advice with a hand therapist or booked for immediate hand therapy follow up. METHOD: A retrospective review of 158 cases operated on over a 4-month COVID19 period compared to the same 4-month period 1 year previously. Indications for surgery and type of anaesthesia were recorded. Follow up and complication rates were reviewed for the COVID19 patients. RESULTS: There were similarities in the demographic of patients across both cohorts and in mechanism of injury, with trauma the highest indication for surgery. The comparable data sets showed only 21% of patients treated used WALANT pre-COVID19 versus 100% of patient during COVID19. CONCLUSIONS: WALANT is a viable model by which to perform emergency hand trauma surgery in a low cost and low resource setting. Previously this model was not utilised to full effect in our hospital. The results demonstrate the adaptability of WALANT in an adverse and dynamic situation, such as COVID19, thus highlighting benefits to patient care and service provision.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BIqQBx

However, a closer examination of the information revealed that the reported drop may be a 'false alarm' based on a series of articles related to this critical decision-making moment for prospective students. Studies regarding doctoral programmes are limited due, in part, to the relative marginalization of degree holders and low recognition of degrees in Japan. Thus, this case study was conducted to clarify the particular situations faced by Japanese doctoral students and how news is reported through digital media.

medical,"Extensive non-pharmaceutical and physical distancing measures are currently the primary interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing, with the timing of distancing measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and five other jurisdictions, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimated the impact that physical distancing (social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examined the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We found that, as of April 11 2020, distancing had a strong impact in BC, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers; individuals practising physical distancing experienced approximately 0.22 (0.11-0.34 90% CI [credible interval]) of their normal contact rate. The threshold above which prevalence was expected to grow was 0.55. We define the ""contact ratio"" to be the ratio of the estimated contact rate to the threshold rate at which cases are expected to grow; we estimated this contact ratio to be 0.40 (0.19-0.60) in BC. We developed an R package 'covidseir' to make our model available, and used it to quantify the impact of distancing in five additional jurisdictions. As of May 7, 2020, we estimated that New Zealand was well below its threshold value (contact ratio of 0.22 [0.11-0.34]), New York (0.60 [0.43-0.74]), Washington (0.84 [0.79-0.90]) and Florida (0.86 [0.76-0.96]) were progressively closer to theirs yet still below, but California (1.15 [1.07-1.23]) was above its threshold overall, with cases still rising. Accordingly, we found that BC, New Zealand, and New York may have had more room to relax distancing measures than the other jurisdictions, though this would need to be done cautiously and with total case volumes in mind. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures-if sufficiently strong and robustly followed-could control COVID-19 transmission. This approach provides a useful tool for jurisdictions to monitor and assess current levels of distancing relative to their threshold, which will continue to be essential through subsequent waves of this pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",TnarYl

Unlike prior to the pandemic, when online and offline activities were conducted side-by-side, many aspects of consumers’ daily lives are only conducted online, especially shopping and meetings. This study analysed the characteristics of consumers who have used offline shopping channels during the pandemic. In addition, participants were asked how often they will use online and offline shopping channels after society stabilizes from COVID-19 in order to analyse what determinants will be used to select either online or offline shopping channels after the pandemic.

medical,"BACKGROUND: A concern about the susceptibility of immunocompromised patients to the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raised. We aimed at describing COVID-19 infections in the French cohort of lung transplant (LT) patients. METHODS: Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients, 7 (53.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients. Overall survival rate was 85.7% after a median follow-up of 50 days [41.0-56.5]. Four of 5 nonsurvivors had had bronchial complications or intensification of immunosuppression in the previous weeks. On univariate analysis, overweight was significantly associated with risk of death (odds ratio 16.0 [95% confidence interval1.5-170.6], p=0.02). CONCLUSION: For the 35 LT recipients with COVID-19, the presentation was severe, requiring hospitalization in most cases, with a survival rate of 85.7%.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Bol4MC

medical,"Hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia could have serious implications and possibly lead to progress from a mild form to a severe outcome of Covid-19. Susceptibility of subjects with low magnesium status to develop and enhance this infection is possible. There is little data on the magnesium status of patients with Covid-19 with different degrees of severity. This study was conducted to evaluate prevalence of dysmagnesemia in a prospective Covid-19 cohort study according to the severity of the clinical manifestations and to identify factors associated. Serum magnesium was measured in 300 of 549 patients admitted to the hospital due to severe Covid-19. According to the WHO guidelines, patients were classified as moderate, severe, or critical. 48% patients had a magnesemia below 0.75 mmol/L (defined as magnesium deficiency) including 13% with a marked hypomagnesemia (<0.65 mmol/L). 9.6% had values equal to or higher than 0.95 mmol/L. Serum magnesium concentrations were significantly lower in female than in male (0.73 ± 0.12 vs 0.80 ± 0.13 mmol/L), whereas the sex ratio M/F was higher in severe and critical form (p<0.001). In a bivariate analysis, the risk of magnesium deficiency was significantly and negatively associated with infection severity (p<0.001), sex ratio (M/F, p<0.001), oxygenotherapy (p<0.001), stay in critical care unit (p=0.028), and positively with nephropathy (p=0.026). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the strongest predictors of magnesium deficiency were female sex (OR=2.67, p<0.001) and nephropathy (OR=2.12, p=0.032) and after exclusion of sex ratio, the severity of infection (OR=0.46, p=0.04 and OR=0.39 p=0.01), for critical and moderate forms, respectively.

medical,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused changes in both patient profile and dental services due to the high risk of COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reasons for applying to the pediatric dental clinics. METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a questionnaire was given to the parents of systemically healthy children aged 0-14 years who applied to the paedodontics clinics for oral examinations. The families were asked about their sociodemographic status, reasons for the application, and their opinions about the pandemic. The obtained data were analyzed using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman's rank correlation, and binary logistic regression analysis tests. RESULTS: While the most common reason for presentation was toothache (49.8%), the percentage of the patients who applied to the Pediatric Dental Clinic, School of Dentistry, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey, with urgent reasons was 58.2%. There was an increase in the urgent application in children with low income and younger children (P < 0.010). A negative correlation was found between the urgent applications and income level (r = -0.100, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 and similar outbreaks that may occur in the future, it is of great importance for pediatric dentists to be able to effectively manage urgent applications in children to protect public health and reduce contamination.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",r6vKZD

METHODS: Mothers of 572 infants (46% girls) aged 1-12 months (M = 5.9, standard deviation = 2.9) participated. Assessments were conducted on 4 occasions from late March to May 2020. Infant sleep was measured objectively using auto-videosomnography. Mothers reported their sheltering status, demographic characteristics, and infant sleep. RESULTS: Infants of mothers in home confinement had later sleep offset times and longer nighttime sleep durations, compared to infants of mothers who were working as usual. At the end of March, these infants also had earlier bedtimes, more nighttime awakenings, and more parental nighttime visits, but differences were not apparent during April and May. CONCLUSIONS: Living restrictions issued in the United States may have led to longer sleep durations and temporary delays in sleep consolidation for infants of mothers in home confinement.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",MFuZIk

In consequence, there is a point of local extrema of curvature defined only as a function of the sensitivity a and specificity b beyond which the rate of change of a test’s ρ drops precipitously relative to ϕ. Herein, we show the mathematical model exploring this phenomenon and define the prevalence threshold (ϕ(e)) point where this change occurs as: [Image: see text] where ε = a + b. From the prevalence threshold we deduce a more generalized relationship between prevalence and positive predictive value as a function of ε, which represents a fundamental theorem of screening, herein defined as: [Image: see text] Understanding the concepts described in this work can help contextualize the validity of screening tests in real time, and help guide the interpretation of different clinical scenarios in which screening is undertaken.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Lvhkoy

medical,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infected over 3300 healthcare workers in early 2020 in China. Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. METHODS: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5â days, the mean±sd clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2â days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5â days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers should be alert during the epidemic and self-quarantine if self-suspected of infection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",twnALj

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The Saudi Arabian healthcare divisions that recruit and hire pharmacists include hospital pharmacy, community pharmacies, universities, and research centres. Local studies showed that hospital pharmacy is the most preferred sector, while community pharmacy is the least preferred. However, jobs in hospital pharmacy are limited compared to community pharmacy. Hence, to accommodate the increasing numbers of pharmacy graduates and to facilitate the implementation of Saudi Vision 2030, which promotes primary healthcare and the participation of both private and non-governmental organisations in healthcare delivery, community pharmacy ought to be Saudised. This study was conducted to assess the career choices made by Saudi pharmacy students and the enablers that influence their career choice, especially in community pharmacy. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional approach was used. A total of 437 final year pharmacy students were recruited from 15 pharmacy schools around the country. RESULTS: Salary and advancement opportunities as well as geographical location, benefits, and work environment were found to be ""very important"" enablers when making career decisions. Hospital pharmacy was selected as the most preferred sector by 242 (55.4%) of the participants, while community pharmacy was the least favoured pharmacy sector (17% or 6.2%). The enablers that might influence the consideration of a job in community pharmacy included career aspiration and social accountability. On the other hand, the barriers were personal beliefs about the sector and the nature of the work. CONCLUSIONS: The community pharmacy sector was found to be the least preferred sector to work in. The study revealed a list of enablers that the participants found to be relevant or of high relevance when choosing community pharmacy as a career pathway. Some of the enablers contribute to the role of the pharmacist towards the local community, social accountability, and towards the country's Vision, such as interaction with the general public and educating them. Other enablers are related to the pharmacists' career aspirations, such as owning a business. Some of the barriers that were found relevant include high workload, inflexible working hours, and limited opportunities for professional development. Localisation of community pharmacies would help to create more jobs for national pharmacists, increase the participation of female pharmacists in the workforce and support the achievement of Vision 2030. The barriers should be tackled on several levels: undergraduate curriculum, regulatory, and actual practice. Undergraduate education needs to include primary pharmaceutical care services in its curriculum. Regulatory changes include enforcing the renationalisation of the community pharmacy sector and permitting females to work in community pharmacies without location restrictions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fRZkqT
medical,"The upsurge inthe cases of COVID-19 around the world, plenty of potential COVID-19 complicationsare becoming more prevalent, including a higher risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Mucormycosis is one such condition which has high prevalence among individuals with diabetes who were infected with COVID-19.The usage of steroids in the treatment further inflates the risk of infection and exacerbation of disease in preexistent Mucormycosis patients. Generally, Corticosteroid-induced diabetes can arise on long-term steroid medication, increasing the likelihood of Mucormycosis. In patients with COVID-19, the indications and dose of corticosteroids should be properly regulated, and persons with diabetes who take insulin or oral anti-diabetic medicines should be cautious. To avoid poor outcomes, strategies to improve glycemic management should be emphasized.

medical,"One application of personalized medicine is the tailoring of medication to the individual, so that the medication will have the highest chance of success. In order to individualize medication, one must have a complete inventory of all current pharmaceutical compounds (a detailed formulary) combined with pharmacogenetic datasets, the genetic makeup of the patient, their (medical) family history and other health-related data. For healthcare professionals to make the best use of this information, it must be visualized in a way that makes the most medically relevant data accessible for their decision-making. Similarly, to enable bioinformatics analysis of these data, it must be prepared and provided through an interface for controlled computational analysis. Due to the high degree of personal information gathered for such initiatives, privacy-sensitive implementation choices and ethical standards are paramount. The Personal Genetic Locker project provides an approach to enable the use of personal genomic data in primary care.

medical,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had various impacts onpatients' realities. It had many physical but also psychological repercussions. It led to the onset of general stress, anxiety and depression affecting different age groups. In this study, we report the frequency of anxiety in patients followed in the department of rheumatology during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objectives: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients followed for inflammatory rheumatic disorders (IRD) or degenerative diseases in the Department of Rheumatology during the period of breakdown and health restrictions. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the department of rheumatology over a 5-month period from August 2020 to December 2020. Included patients were followed for IRD or degenerative pathology in the department. A pre-established questionnaire collected the symptoms and results of COVID-19 tests, the possible deterioration of the general condition since breakdown, as well as the increase of the disease activity of the rheumatism, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and the onset of signs of depression or sleep disturbances.The impact of the decrease in physical activity and the cessation of basic treatments of rheumatism with the different causes was also collected. Results: 159 patients were included: 27 with Rheumatoid arthritis, 58 with Spondyloarthropathies, 32 with chondrocalcinosis, 9 with gouty arthropathies, and 33 with osteoarthritis. Of these, 15% had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. 25 patients performed the PCR test, of which 17 were positive and only 3 required hospitalization.None were put on oxygen. 32% reported a worsening of their rheumatism since the beginning of the epidemic, of which 35.9% reported increased pain and 21 noted a decrease in physical activity. 27.1% felt more stressed and irritated, and 14% felt more depressed. 54% had more sleepdisturbance, 22.2% had more fatigue compared to their state before the epidemic. 41.2% were afraid to come for consultation or hospitalization. 11.8% had stopped the basic treatment of their rheumatism, either for a shortage of the product in the pharmacy, or for the inability to obtain a travel authorization from the authorities Conclusion: The physical and mental impact of the COVID-19pandemic affected approximately one-third of our population. Patients described worsening rheumatism and pain, as well as impaired sleep, fatigue and anxiety[1].Decreased physical activity was associated with increased rheumatism activity and pain. More than 50% of the patients presented a deterioration in their physical and mental health linked to the health situation[2]. Our results are consistent with the literature. It is classically admitted that rheumatic pathologiesare disabling and therefore lead to a withdrawal into oneself, generating an anxious state. It is essential to assess the psychological status of patients followed for rheumatism in order to develop preventive treatments and prevent its worsening linked to the impact of the pandemic[3].",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EAFAvQ

medical,"UNLABELLED Clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) prominently expresses vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and new treatment strategies for renal cell cancer (RCC) aim at the inhibition of VEGF-VEGF receptor signaling. This study explores the ability of (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy to depict RCC and to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor. METHODS The ability to depict RCC with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy was tested in 14 patients scheduled to undergo a tumor nephrectomy; of these, 9 RCC patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice a day). In the latter group, baseline and posttreatment (111)In-bevacizumab scans were compared. The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-bevacizumab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of VEGF-A, glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase IX, α-smooth-muscle actin, and Ki67 was determined by immunohistochemistry and compared with the local concentration of (111)In-bevacizumab. Additionally, the VEGF-A content in tumor samples was determined quantitatively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS In all 5 non-neoadjuvant-treated patients, preferential accumulation of (111)In-bevacizumab was observed in the tumors. All ccRCC lesions with enhanced (111)In-bevacizumab targeting expressed high levels of VEGF-A. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in the tumor in the patients with ccRCC (mean change, -60.5%; range, +1.5% to -90.1%). The decrease in uptake was due to destruction of the tumor neovasculature, whereas the VEGF-A expression remained intact. In the patient with papillary RCC, limited uptake without change after sorafenib was observed. CONCLUSION RCC lesions were clearly delineated with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy. Neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in RCC. (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy can be an attractive biomarker for response and needs further study.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0OrxaN

medical,"Determining causes of deaths (COD) occurred outside of civil registration and vital statistics systems is challenging. A technique called verbal autopsy (VA) is widely adopted to gather information on deaths in practice. A VA consists of interviewing relatives of a deceased person about symptoms of the deceased in the period leading to the death, often resulting in multivariate binary responses. While statistical methods have been devised for estimating the cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) for a study population, continued expansion of VA to new populations (or ""domains"") necessitates approaches that recognize between-domain differences while capitalizing on potential similarities. In this paper, we propose such a domain-adaptive method that integrates external between-domain similarity information encoded by a pre-specified rooted weighted tree. Given a cause, we use latent class models to characterize the conditional distributions of the responses that may vary by domain. We specify a logistic stick-breaking Gaussian diffusion process prior along the tree for class mixing weights with node-specific spike-and-slab priors to pool information between the domains in a data-driven way. Posterior inference is conducted via a scalable variational Bayes algorithm. Simulation studies show that the domain adaptation enabled by the proposed method improves CSMF estimation and individual COD assignment. We also illustrate and evaluate the method using a validation data set.

However, the complex synthetic methods for their preparation have limited practical applications. This study aims to synthesize novel NanoHybrid Systems based on graphene, polymer, and AgNPs (namely, NanoHy-GPS) through an easy microwave irradiation approach free of reductants and surfactants. The polymer plays a crucial role, as it assures the coating layer/substrate compatibility making the platform easily adaptable for a specific substrate. AgNPs’ loading (from 5% to 87%) can be tuned by the amount of Silver salt used during the microwave-assisted reaction, obtaining spherical AgNPs with average sizes of 5–12 nm homogeneously distributed on a polymer-graphene nanosystem. Interestingly, microwave irradiation partially restored the graphene sp(2) network without damage of ester bonds. The structure, morphology, and chemical composition of NanoHy-GPS and its subunits were characterized by means of UV-vis spectroscopy, thermal analysis, differential light scattering (DLS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) techniques.

Three experiments (N = 77, N = 302, N = 555) conducted in Canada, the US, and the UK showed that White people who are reminded about the ongoing demographic changes and who see race relations as a zero-sum game whereby any gains by minorities must come at the expense of the majority, experience stronger collective angst and, to a lesser extent, fear (but not anger). In turn, collective angst, but not the other negative group-based emotions, fuels their motivation to protect the existing intergroup hierarchy by withdrawing support for progressive social movements and increases anti-immigration sentiments. Downregulating the existential threat experienced by White majorities in the face of a racial demographic shift may be one way to reduce acrimonious behavioral intentions aimed at preserving their place in the social hierarchy.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jPSx7I

medical,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to detect the associations between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) status of a herd and respiratory disease (BRD) occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows. The association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. METHODS: Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. RESULTS: A low to moderate prevalence (1-49%) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6.2, p = 0.010) in cows and in-calf heifers. Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (> 1.3%) and increased insemination index (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (> 1.9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV-1 antibodies (1-49%) in cows. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 was not associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle, however was significantly related to reproductive performance. BRSV possesses the main role in respiratory disease complex in adult dairy cattle.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Vm74zs

medical,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has come with many challenges for healthcare providers and patients alike. In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending. This includes the need to reimpose the same strategy as further waves unfold.

medical,"Background Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are pivotal to detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and duration of detectable virus indicating potential for infectivity. Methods We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Findings Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Interpretation RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",48tYJS

medical,"INTRODUCTION The objective of this study is to report the impact of computed tomography (CT) screening on the use of Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) in a randomized screening trial. METHODS The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial is a randomized clinically controlled trial of 4104 smokers and previous smokers who were randomized to either screening with five annual low-dose CT scans or no screening in Copenhagen from 2004 to 2006. The major end point is the effect of CT screening on lung cancer mortality and treatment options. All diagnostic and treatment interventions in both groups were monitored prospectively until 1 to 3 years after the last screening round. RESULTS By February 1, 2011 68 cases of lung cancer were detected in the screening group. Furthermore, seven patients with a benign nodule underwent surgical treatment because of suspicion of malignancy (12%). Fifty-one of the 68 lung cancer patients were eligible for surgical treatment. Eight patients had open thoracotomy. Of the operations for lung cancer, 84% were performed by VATS in the CT-screened arm, significantly higher than the control arm (p < 0.05). Thirty-six patients had a VATS lobectomy. One patient had a VATS segmentectomy, and four patients had a VATS wedge resection. The seven benign nodules were all treated with VATS. CONCLUSIONS CT screening seems to facilitate the use of VATS in the treatment of lung cancer with an 84% rate in our data. Furthermore, all benign nodules could be removed by VATS. In our view, a basic requirement for a surgical institution to be involved in lung cancer CT screening is a dedicated VATS program.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1XU-5p

medical,"Due to the irregular shapes,various sizes and indistinguishable boundaries between the normal and infected tissues, it is still a challenging task to accurately segment the infected lesions of COVID-19 on CT images. In this paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections of COVID-19 by enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of different levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep collaborative supervision (Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the network learning the features of edges and semantics. More specifically, an Edge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level boundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the initial stage of down-sampling. Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised Module (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level semantic information by integrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an Attention Fusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of different levels by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps between high-level and low-level feature maps. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19 CT datasets. The results show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the baseline (ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase Dice metric by 1.12%, 1.95%,1.63% in our dataset, while the integration by incorporating three models together can rise 3.97%. Compared with the existing approaches in various datasets, the proposed method can obtain better segmentation performance in some main metrics, and can achieve the best generalization and comprehensive performance.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",j3kYiq

A particular concern is the potential for viral transmission by way of aerosol which may be generated during perioperative care. There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context. METHODS: A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation. After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada. RESULTS: The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage. Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point. CONCLUSIONS: The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future. In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EO_8pF

medical,"The replication of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells. The unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mediated by ER stress (ERS), is a typical outcome in coronavirus-infected cells and is closely associated with the characteristics of coronaviruses. However, the interaction between virus-induced ERS and coronavirus replication is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that infection with the betacoronavirus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) induced ERS and triggered all three branches of the UPR signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ERS suppressed PHEV replication in mouse neuro-2a (N2a) cells primarily by activating the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)–eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) axis of the UPR. Moreover, another eIF2α phosphorylation kinase, interferon (IFN)-induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), was also activated and acted cooperatively with PERK to decrease PHEV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PERK/PKR-eIF2α pathways negatively regulated PHEV replication by attenuating global protein translation. Phosphorylated eIF2α also promoted the formation of stress granules (SGs), which in turn repressed PHEV replication. In summary, our study presents a vital aspect of the host innate response to invading pathogens and reveals attractive host targets (e.g., PERK, PKR, and eIF2α) for antiviral drugs. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus diseases are caused by different coronaviruses of importance in humans and animals, and specific treatments are extremely limited. ERS, which can activate the UPR to modulate viral replication and the host innate response, is a frequent occurrence in coronavirus-infected cells. PHEV, a neurotropic betacoronavirus, causes nerve cell damage, which accounts for the high mortality rates in suckling piglets. However, it remains incompletely understood whether the highly developed ER in nerve cells plays an antiviral role in ERS and how ERS regulates viral proliferation. In this study, we found that PHEV infection induced ERS and activated the UPR both in vitro and in vivo and that the activated PERK/PKR-eIF2α axis inhibited PHEV replication through attenuating global protein translation and promoting SG formation. A better understanding of coronavirus-induced ERS and UPR activation may reveal the pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus and facilitate the development of new treatment strategies for these diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",kcLOEb

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a new climate of uncertainty which is fuelling protectionism and playing into nationalist narratives. Globalisation is under significant threat as governments scramble to reduce their vulnerability to the virus by limiting global trade and flows of people. With the imposition of border closures and strict migration measures, there have been major disruptions in Africa’s global supply chains with adverse impacts on employment and poverty. The African economies overly reliant on single export-orientated industries, such as oil and gas, are expected to be severely hit. This situation is further aggravated by tumbling oil prices and a lowered global demand for African non-oil products. The agricultural sector, which should buffer these shocks, is also being affected by the enforcement of lockdowns which threaten people’s livelihoods and food security. Lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa and the issue of public health pandemic response will need to be addressed by enacting context-specific policies which should be implemented in a humane way. In addressing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on African nations, we argue that governments should prioritize social protection programmes to provide people with resources to maintain economic productivity while limiting job losses. International funders are committing assistance to Africa for this purpose, but generally as loans (adding to debt burdens) rather than as grants. G20 agreement so suspend debt payments for a year will help, but is insufficient to fiscal need. Maintaining cross-border trade and cooperation to continue generating public revenues is desirable. New strategies for diversifying African economies and limiting their dependence on external funding by promoting trade with a more regionalised (continental) focus as promoted by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, while not without limitations, should be explored. While it is premature to judge the final economic and death toll of COVID-19, African leaders’ response to the pandemic, and the support they receive from wealthier nations, will determine its eventual outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2Z39xU

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Since the introduction of the UK's National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its modification, NEWS2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a worldwide pandemic. NEWS and NEWS2 have good predictive abilities in patients with other infections and sepsis, however there is little evidence of their performance in COVID-19. METHODS: Using receiver-operating characteristics analyses, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the performance of NEWS or NEWS2 to discriminate the combined outcome of either death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 24â¯h of a vital sign set in five cohorts (COVID-19 POSITIVE, nâ¯=â¯405; COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, nâ¯=â¯1716; COVID-19 NOT TESTED, nâ¯=â¯2686; CONTROL 2018, nâ¯=â¯6273; CONTROL 2019, nâ¯=â¯6523). RESULTS: The AUROC values for NEWS or NEWS2 for the combined outcome were: COVID-19 POSITIVE, 0.882 (0.868-0.895); COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, 0.875 (0.861-0.89); COVID-19 NOT TESTED, 0.876 (0.85-0.902); CONTROL 2018, 0.894 (0.884-0.904); CONTROL 2019, 0.842 (0.829-0.855). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that NEWS or NEWS2 performance was good and similar in all five cohorts (rangeâ¯=â¯0.842-0.894) suggests that amendments to NEWS or NEWS2, such as the addition of new covariates or the need to change the weighting of existing parameters, are unnecessary when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Our results support the national and international recommendations for the use of NEWS or NEWS2 for the assessment of acute-illness severity in patients with COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",C4jr8C
medical," Spina bifida Overview Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It falls under the broader category of neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Normally, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy, and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine. Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When early treatment for spina bifida is necessary, it's done surgically, although such treatment doesn't always completely resolve the problem. Types Spina bifida can occur in different forms: spina bifida occulta, meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel) or myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel). The severity of spina bifida depends on the type, size, location and complications. ""Occulta"" means hidden. The mildest form, spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons. In a form of spina bifida called meningocele, the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid. But this sac doesn't include the spinal cord, so nerve damage is less likely, though later complications are possible. Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe form. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections. Symptoms Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity. Symptoms can also differ for each person. - Spina bifida occulta. Because the spinal nerves usually aren't involved, typically there are no signs or symptoms. But visible indications can sometimes be seen on the newborn's skin above the spinal defect, including an abnormal tuft of hair, or a small dimple or birthmark. - Meningocele. The membranes around the spinal cord push out through an opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid, but this sac doesn't include the spinal cord. - Myelomeningocele. In this severe form of spina bifida: - The spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. - Both the membranes and the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. - Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. When to see a doctor Typically, meningocele and myelomeningocele are diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. These children should be followed by a specialized team of doctors throughout their lives and families should be educated on the different complications to watch for. Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have any symptoms or complications, so usually only routine pediatric care is needed. Causes Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. As with many other problems, it appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate deficiency. Risk factors Spina bifida is more common among whites and Hispanics, and females are affected more often than males. Although doctors and researchers don't know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors: - Folate deficiency. Folate (vitamin B-9) is important to the healthy development of a baby. Folate is the natural form of vitamin B-9. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. - Family history of neural tube defects. Couples who've had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect. That risk increases if two previous children have been affected by the condition. In addition, a woman who was born with a neural tube defect has a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition. - Some medications. For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy, possibly because they interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid. - Diabetes. Women with diabetes who don't control their blood sugar well have a higher risk of having a baby with spina bifida. - Obesity. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida. - Increased body temperature. Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Elevating your core body temperature, due to fever or the use of saunas or hot tubs, has been associated with a possible slight increased risk of spina bifida. If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your doctor to determine if you need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins. If you take medications, tell your doctor. Some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida, if plans are made ahead of time. Complications Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or only minor physical disabilities. If the spina bifida is severe, sometimes it leads to more significant physical disabilities. Severity is affected by: - The size and location of the neural tube defect - Whether skin covers the affected area - Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord This list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all these complications. And these conditions can be treated. - Walking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect, causing muscle weakness of the legs, sometimes involving paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth. - Orthopedic complications. Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the level of the defect. Possible problems include a curved spine (scoliosis), abnormal growth or dislocation of the hip, bone and joint deformities, muscle contractures and other orthopedic concerns. - Bowel and bladder problems. Nerves that supply the bladder and bowels usually don't work properly when children have myelomeningocele. This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord. - Accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly experience accumulation of fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus. - Shunt malfunction. Shunts can stop working or become infected. Warning signs may vary. Some of the warning signs of a shunt that isn't working include headaches, vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, swelling or redness along the shunt, confusion, changes in the eyes (fixed downward gaze), trouble feeding, or seizures. - Chiari malformation type II. Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type II is a common brain abnormality in children with the myelomeningocele form of spina bifida. The brainstem, or lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord, is elongated and positioned lower than usual. This can cause problems with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, compression on this area of the brain occurs and surgery is needed to relieve the pressure. - Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis). Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. This potentially life-threatening infection may cause brain injury. - Tethered spinal cord. Tethered spinal cord results when the spinal nerves become bound to the scar where the defect was closed surgically, making the spinal cord less able to grow as the child grows. This progressive tethering can cause loss of muscle function to the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability. - Sleep-disordered breathing. Both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, may have sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Assessment for a sleep disorder in those with myelomeningocele helps detect sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which warrants treatment to improve health and quality of life. - Skin problems. Children with spina bifida may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or back. They can't feel when they get a blister or sore. Sores or blisters can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of wound problems in casts. - Latex allergy. Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. Latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It can also cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which swelling of the face and airways can make breathing difficult. So it's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida. - Other complications. More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disabilities, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math. Diagnosis If you're pregnant, you'll be offered prenatal screening tests to check for spina bifida and other birth defects. The tests aren't perfect. Some mothers who have positive blood tests have normal babies. Even if the results are negative, there's still a small chance that spina bifida is present. Talk to your doctor about prenatal testing, its risks and how you might handle the results. Blood tests Your doctor will most likely check for spina bifida by first performing these tests: - Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother's blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) - a protein produced by the baby. It's normal for a small amount of AFP to cross the placenta and enter the mother's bloodstream. But abnormally high levels of AFP suggest that the baby has a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida, though some spina bifida cases don't produce high levels of AFP. - Test to confirm high AFP levels. Varying levels of AFP can be caused by other factors - including a miscalculation in fetal age or multiple babies - so your doctor may order a follow-up blood test for confirmation. If the results are still high, you'll need further evaluation, including an ultrasound exam. - Other blood tests. Your doctor may perform the MSAFP test with two or three other blood tests. These tests are commonly done with the MSAFP test, but their objective is to screen for other abnormalities, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), not neural tube defects. Ultrasound Many obstetricians rely on ultrasonography to screen for spina bifida. If blood tests indicate high AFP levels, your doctor will suggest an ultrasound exam to help determine why. The most common ultrasound exams bounce high-frequency sound waves off tissues in your body to form images on a video monitor. The information these images provide can help establish whether there's more than one baby and can help confirm gestational age, two factors that can affect AFP levels. An advanced ultrasound also can detect signs of spina bifida, such as an open spine or particular features in your baby's brain that indicate spina bifida. Amniocentesis If a blood test shows high levels of AFP in your blood but the ultrasound is normal, your doctor may offer amniocentesis. During amniocentesis, your doctor uses a needle to remove a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby. An analysis of the sample indicates the level of AFP present in the amniotic fluid. A small amount of AFP is normally found in amniotic fluid. However, when an open neural tube defect is present, the amniotic fluid contains an elevated amount of AFP because the skin surrounding the baby's spine is gone and AFP leaks into the amniotic sac. Discuss the risks of amniocentesis, including a slight risk of loss of the pregnancy, with your doctor. Treatment Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible. ",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fdVW7y

Digital competence forms the basis for data literacy in medical and scientific education. In this study, the students’ evaluation of the seminar focusing on digital and scientific skill acquisition is presented. METHODS: Included in this prospective monocentric questionnaire study were 265 students. The seminar started with an introduction on the criteria of a good publication, followed by the individual task of understanding the publication on a main ORL topic and writing its abstract. After the seminar, students completed the evaluation questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, results showed that students rated the seminar well. Free-text comments added that although live teaching was preferred, students found their digital and scientific competence increased through the task of writing a publication abstract on their own. CONCLUSION: Digital education was not only rated well, but improved the students’ subjective scientific competence, satisfied the students’ wish for digital transformation, and likewise fulfilled the national goals of competence-based education.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GTAvYV

medical,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technology is increasingly used in disease management. Using mHealth tools to integrate and streamline care has improved clinical outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential clinical and health economic outcomes of mHealth-based integrated care for AF from the perspective of a public health care provider in China. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare outcomes of mHealth-based care and usual care in a hypothetical cohort of patients with AF in China. The time horizon was 30 years with monthly cycles. Model outcomes measured were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, mHealth-based care gained higher QALYs of 0.0730 with an incurred cost of US $1090. Using US $33,438 per QALY (three times the gross domestic product) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, mHealth-based care was cost-effective, with an ICER of US $14,936 per QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, no influential factor with a threshold value was identified. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, mHealth-based care was accepted as cost-effective in 92.33% of 10,000 iterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the expected cost-effectiveness of applying mHealth-based integrated care for AF according to a model-based health economic evaluation. The exploration suggested the potential cost-effective use of mHealth apps in streamlining and integrating care via the Atrial fibrillation Better Care (ABC) pathway for AF in China. Future economic evaluation alongside randomized clinical trials is highly warranted to verify the suggestion and investigate affecting factors such as geographical variations in patient characteristics, identification of subgroups, and constraints on local implementation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rmi_vP

We particularly focus on key-regulators, cell-receptors, and host-processes that are hijacked by the virus for its advantage. ACE2-controlled processes involve a key-regulator CD300e (a TYROBP receptor) and the activation of IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. We further investigate the age-dependency of such receptors and identify the adipose and the brain as potentially contributing tissues for the diseases severity in old patients. In contrast, several other tissues in the young population are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

medical,"Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) can elicit serious inflammatory responses and cause meningitis in piglets. Previous epigenetic studies have indicated that alterations in host DNA methylation may modify the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome during meningitis caused by G. parasuis infection is still lacking. In this study, we employed an unbiased approach using deep sequencing to profile the DNA methylome and transcriptome from G. parasuis infected porcine brain (cerebrum) and integrated the data to identify key differential methylation regions/sites involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Results showed that DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles from porcine brain were changed after G. parasuis infection. The majority of the altered DNA methylation regions were found in the intergenic regions and introns and not associated with CpG islands, with only a low percentage occurring at promoter or exon regions. Integrated analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome identified a number of inversely and positively correlated genes between DNA methylation and gene expression, following the criteria of |log(2)FC| > 0.5, |diffMethy| > 0.1, and P < 0.05. Differential expression and methylation of two significant genes, semaphoring 4D (SEMA4D) and von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1 (VWA1), were validated by qRT-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation inversely correlated genes in G. parasuis infected porcine brains were mainly involved with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, RIG-1-like receptor signaling pathways, and hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathways. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network of differentially methylated genes found potential candidate molecular interactions relevant to the pathology of G. parasuis infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the DNA methylome and transcriptome data from G. parasuis infected porcine brains. Our findings will help understanding the contribution of genome-wide DNA methylation to the pathogenesis of meningitis in pigs and developing epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of G. parasuis induced meningitis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dnnH4c

So far, there is scarce evidence for the current treatment options available for COVID-19. Vitamin C has previously been used for treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. We reviewed the feasibility of using vitamin C in the setting of COVID-19 in a series of patients. METHODS: We sequentially identified a series of patients who were requiring at least 30% of FiO2 or more who received IV vitamin C as part of the COVID-19 treatment and analyzed their demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared inflammatory markers pre and post treatment including D-dimer and ferritin. RESULTS: We identified a total of 17 patients who received IV vitamin C for COVID-19. The inpatient mortality rate in this series was 12% with 17.6% rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation. We noted a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, and a trend to decreasing FiO2 requirements, after vitamin C administration. CONCLUSION: The use of IV vitamin C in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease may be feasible.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ssol2z

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has great consequences on mental health. We aimed to assess medical students' psychological condition and influencing factors as a baseline evidence for interventions promoting their mental wellbeing. We conducted an online survey from April 8 to April 18, 2020 to examine the mental health of medical students by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, seven-item Insomnia Severity Index, and six-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Five hundred forty-nine students completed the survey; 341 (62.3%), 410 (74.6%), 344 (62.6%), and 379 (69%) reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Female students, living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations, more than 25 days confinement, psychiatric consult history, and being in a preclinical level of studies had higher median scores and severe symptom levels. Multivariable logistic regression showed female gender as a risk factor for severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.653; 95% CI: 1.020-2.679; P = 0.042), depression (OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.435-3.271; P < 0.001), insomnia (OR: 1.830; 95% CI: 1.176-2.847; P = 0.007), and distress (OR: 1.994; 95% CI: 1.338-2.972; P = 0.001); preclinical level of enrollment as a risk factor for depression (OR: 0.679; 95% CI: 0.521-0.885; P = 0.004), insomnia (OR: 0.720; 95% CI: 0.545-0.949; P = 0.02), and distress (OR: 0.650; 95% CI: 0.499-0.847; P = 0.001), whereas living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations was a risk factor for severe anxiety (OR: 1.628; 95% CI: 1.090-2.432; P = 0.017) and depression (OR: 1.438; 95% CI: 1.002-2.097; P = 0.05). Currently, medical students experience high levels of mental health symptoms, especially female students, those at a preclinical level and living in regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases.

medical,"Stress and mental health at work are the leading causes of long-term sickness absence in the UK, with chronically poor working conditions impacting employee physiological and psychological health. Social workers play a significant part in the fabric of UK society, but have one of the most stressful occupations in the country. The aim of this project was to work with UK social workers to co-develop, implement, and evaluate a series of smartphone-based mental health initiatives. A Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group and steering group discussions, was utilized to design the mental health and well-being interventions. Study efficacy was evaluated via a pre- and post-intervention survey and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Interventions developed were psycho-educational, improved top-down and bottom-up communication, and provided access to a Vocational Rehabilitation Assistant for those struggling and at risk of sickness absence. Six months following dissemination, surveys demonstrated significant improvements in communication, and mean score improvements in four other working conditions. This project, therefore, demonstrates that co-developed initiatives can be positively impactful, despite post-intervention data collection being impacted by COVID-19. Future studies should build upon these findings and broaden the PAR approach nationally while taking a robust approach to evaluation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",yEvfT7

Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea if you have IBS.Eating foods that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables, may help.Fiber may improve constipation symptoms caused by IBS because it makes stool soft and easier to pass. Fiber is a part of foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services state in its Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (PDF, 2.963 MB) that adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.3While fiber may help constipation, it may not reduce the abdominal discomfort or pain of IBS. In fact, some people with IBS may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Add foods with fiber to your diet a little at a time to let your body get used to them. Too much fiber at once can cause gas, which can trigger symptoms in people with IBS.

A consensus report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently affirmed the foundational role of primary care in optimizing individual and population health and called on state and national policy makers to make high-quality primary care “a common good that is accessible to everyone.” 10,11 A recent editorial in AFP described the collaboration of several primary care physician societies and boards, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, to create a new health care payment paradigm with the principles of primary care serving as the backbone.12 Although the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the impressive versatility of family medicine to meet changing health system needs, it has also dangerously stretched practice finances and challenged the resilience of many primary care physicians, with 71% reporting all-time high levels of burn-out or mental exhaustion.13 The primary care chartbook is just one of many resources that remind us of the central role family physicians have in helping our communities thrive.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Qw4kTa

medical,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peak around March 2020 led to temporary closures of most fertility clinics. Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study.

medical,"The exponential growth of biomedical data in recent years has urged the application of numerous machine learning techniques to address emerging problems in biology and clinical research. By enabling the automatic feature extraction, selection, and generation of predictive models, these methods can be used to efficiently study complex biological systems. Machine learning techniques are frequently integrated with bioinformatic methods, as well as curated databases and biological networks, to enhance training and validation, identify the best interpretable features, and enable feature and model investigation. Here, we review recently developed methods that incorporate machine learning within the same framework with techniques from molecular evolution, protein structure analysis, systems biology, and disease genomics.

medical,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing homes and assisted living facilities have accounted for over 20% of all infections, adult day care and other congregate sites have closed, and traditional home care agencies are facing staff shortages. In this environment, self-direction of home and community-based services, where the participant can hire their own staff and manage a budget that can be used for a broad range of goods and services including home modifications and assistive devices, is seen as a promising intervention. Using self-direction participants can minimize the number of people who enter their homes and pay close family and friends who were already providing many hours of informal care, and now may be unemployed. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is encouraging this approach. This commentary presents information on how states have responded using the new CMS Toolkit by expanding who can be a paid caregiver, increasing budgets and broadening the kinds of items that can be purchased with budgets to include items like personal protective equipment and supports for telehealth.

medical,"This Snowmass21 Contributed Paper encourages the Particle Physics community in fostering R&D in Superconducting Nb3Sn coated Copper RF Cavities instead of costly bulk Niobium. It describes the pressing need to devote effort in this direction, which would deliver higher gradient and higher temperature of operation and reduce the overall capital and operational costs of any future collider. It is unlikely that an ILC will be built in the next ten years with Nb as one of the main cost drivers of SRFs. This paper provides strong arguments on the benefits of using this time for R&D on producing Nb3Sn on inexpensive and thermally efficient metals such as Cu or bronze, while pursuing in parallel the novel U.S. concept of parallel-feed RF accelerator structures. A technology that synergistically uses both of these advanced tools would make an ILC or equivalent machines more affordable and more likely to be built. Such a successful enterprise would readily apply to other HEP accelerators, for instance a Muon Collider, and to accelerators beyond HEP. We present and assess current efforts in the U.S. on the novel concept of parallel-feed RF accelerator structures, and in the U.S. and abroad in producing Nb3Sn films on either Cu or bronze despite minimal funding.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6EteJj

medical,"A narrative review was conducted to examine the current state of the utilisation of telemedicine amid the current COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the benefits of continuing telemedicine usage in the future. A literature review was performed for articles related to telemedicine. Databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE were searched. Three reviewers independently performed article selection based on relevance to our topic. We included all articles between 1990 and 2020 related to telemedicine using the following keywords: 'telemedicine', 'telehealth', 'policy', 'COVID-19', 'regulation', 'rural', 'physical examination', 'future'. A total of 60 articles were identified, and through careful selection we narrowed the final number of articles to 42 based on relevance to our topic. Telemedicine has been rapidly evolving over the past several decades. Issues with regulation and reimbursement have prevented its full immersion into the healthcare system. During the current pandemic, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have expanded access to telemedicine services. The advantages of telemedicine moving forward include its cost-effectiveness, ability to extend access to specialty services and its potential to help mitigate the looming physician shortage. Disadvantages include lack of available technological resources in certain parts of the country, issues with security of patient data, and challenges in performing the traditional patient examination.

medical,"Previously published studies on population distribution were based on the provincial level, while the number of urban-level studies is more limited. In addition, the rough spatial resolution of traditional nighttime light (NTL) data has limited their fine application in current small-scale population distribution research. For the purpose of studying the spatial distribution of populations at the urban scale, we proposed a new index (i.e., the road network adjusted human settlement index, RNAHSI) by integrating Luojia 1-01 (LJ 1-01) NTL data, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and road network density (RND) data based on population density relationships to depict the spatial distribution of urban human settlements. The RNAHSI updated the high-resolution NTL data and combined the RND data on the basis of human settlement index (HSI) data to refine the spatial pattern of urban population distribution. The results indicated that the mean relative error (MRE) between the population estimation data based on the RNAHSI and the demographic data was 34.80%, which was lower than that in the HSI and WorldPop dataset. This index is suitable primarily for the study of urban population distribution, as the RNAHSI can clearly highlight human activities in areas with dense urban road networks and can refine the spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas. In addition, we also drew a population density map of the city of Shenzhen with a 100 m spatial resolution for 2018 based on the RNAHSI, which has great reference significance for urban management and urban resource allocation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",a3s2Oo

medical,"BACKGROUND Parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy techniques allow a lesser volume resection (<3 adjacent segments) for tumors involving the hepatic veins at the hepatocaval confluence, assuring adequate volume of the future liver remnant. We report the ability to perform parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy as planned from the preoperative imaging and the type of vascular intervention used to preserve hepatic outflow. METHODS We analyzed 60 consecutive parenchyma-sparing hepatectomies in 54 patients for 7 primary and 53 metastatic tumors (48 colorectal), located in segments I, VII, VIII, or IVa and involving the hepatocaval confluence. Patients had a median of 2 (range: 1-18) lesions with median diameter of 4 cm (range: 1.2-16.5), which were bilateral in 43%. RESULTS A parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy was performed in all of the 60 cases, only one case required the resection of 3 adjacent segments. In 16 (27%) hepatic veins-resections, the outflow was assured by preservation of the inferior-right-hepatic veins in 3 (5%), of the communicating-veins in 4 (7%), of the middle-hepatic veins in 3 (4%; middle-hepatic veins patch-reconstruction in 2 cases), by polytetrafluoroethylene-grafts in 4 (7%), and by hepatic veins-anastomosis in 2 (3%). In 15 (25%) cases, the hepatic veins were resected tangentially and reconstructed by direct suture venorraphy. In 29 (48%) cases, the hepatic veins were skeletonized from the tumor. Grade IIIb to IV complications occurred in 7%, median hospital-stay was 9 days, and 90-day mortality occurred in one cirrhotic patient. Median overall and disease-free survivals were 72 and 16 months (median follow-up: 34 months). CONCLUSION A lesser volume parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy rather than a formal major hepatectomy for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence can be performed with a low rate of major complications (7%). Parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy should be considered in highly selected patients when evaluating liver resection for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence based on appropriate and accurate preoperative imaging.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-JM7R_

medical,"MOTIVATION: The reconstruction of possible histories given a sample of genetic data in the presence of recombination and recurrent mutation is a challenging problem, but can provide key insights into the evolution of a population. We present KwARG, which implements a parsimony-based greedy heuristic algorithm for finding plausible genealogical histories (ancestral recombination graphs) that are minimal or near-minimal in the number of posited recombination and mutation events. RESULTS: Given an input dataset of aligned sequences, KwARG outputs a list of possible candidate solutions, each comprising a list of mutation and recombination events that could have generated the dataset; the relative proportion of recombinations and recurrent mutations in a solution can be controlled via specifying a set of ‘cost’ parameters. We demonstrate that the algorithm performs well when compared against existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is available at https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders during COVID-19 have accelerated the adoption of remote and virtual care (RVC) models, potentially including telehealth, telemedicine, and internet-based electronic physician visits (e-visits) for remote consultation, diagnosis, and care, deterring small health care businesses including clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies from aligning resources and operations to new RVC realities. Current perceptions of small health care businesses toward remote care, particularly perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve business sustainability, would highlight the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology among policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of small health care businesses regarding the impact of RVC on their business sustainability during COVID-19, gauge their perceptions of their current levels of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models and analyze how well that aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and determine whether these perceptions influence their view of their midterm sustainability (SUST). METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and sought assistance from a consulting firm to collect survey data in July 2020. Focal estimated study effects were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: In total, 270 respondents, including 82 clinics, 99 small physician offices, and 89 pharmacies, across Colorado were included. SRVC and SCBS had direct, significant, and positive effects on SUST. However, we investigated the effect of the interaction between SRVC and SCBS to determine whether RVC adoption aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of business sustainability. Effects differed among the three groups. The interaction term SRVC×SCBS was significant and positive for clinics (P=.02), significant and negative for physician offices (P=.05), and not significant for pharmacies (P=.76). These variations indicate that while clinics positively perceived RVC alignment with the current business scenario, the opposite held true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide and RVC adoption progresses rapidly, it is critical to understand the impact of RVC on small health care businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. Small physician practices cannot harness RVC developments and, in contrast with clinics, consider it incompatible with business survival during and after COVID-19. If small health care firms cannot compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually become nonoperational, the resulting damage to traditional health care services may be severe, particularly for critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. Our results have implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0PHM83

The professional experience social work and social pedagogy have in dealing with the underlying contradictions and their specific knowledge on how to constitute social solidarity in conditions of justice and equality are now more than ever relevant in the post-crisis reconstruction.

At first, the optimal concentration ratio of S-EGF to S-bFGF in the Dual-HCD matrix is determined to be 1:2 in type I diabetic mice. This Dual-HCD matrix does not cause cytotoxicity and can be used in vivo. The wound-healing effect of this matrix is confirmed in type II diabetic mice. Dual HCD enhances angiogenesis which promotes wound healing and thus, it shows a significantly greater synergistic effect than the HCD matrix loaded with a single growth factor.

medical,"Prostate biopsy is the definitive investigation to diagnose prostate cancer. The ideal procedure would be one that offers fast and efficient results safely as an outpatient procedure. Historically, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy is considered the gold standard but transrectal biopsy can under-sample the anterior and apical regions of the prostate and is associated with a risk of prostate biopsy-related sepsis, which may require intensive care admission. Transperineal (TP) biopsy addresses the inefficient sampling of TRUS biopsy but historically has been done under general anaesthetic, which makes it difficult to incorporate into timed diagnostic pathways such as the National Health Service (NHS) 2-week cancer pathway. TRUS biopsy has remained the mainstay of clinical diagnosis because of its simplicity; however, the recent development of simpler local anaesthetic transperineal techniques has transformed outpatient biopsy practice. These techniques practically eliminate prostate biopsy-related sepsis, have a shallow learning curve and offer effective sampling of all areas of the prostate in an outpatient setting. The effectiveness of TP biopsy has been enhanced by the introduction of multiparametric MRI prior to biopsy, the use of PSA density for risk stratification in equivocal cases and combined with more efficient targeted and systematic biopsies techniques, such as the Ginsburg Protocol, has improved the tolerability and diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic TP biopsies, reducing the risk of complications from the oversampling associated with transperineal template mapping biopsies. Areas where the literature remains unclear is the optimum number of cores needed to detect clinically significant disease (CSD) in patients with a definable lesion on MRI, in particular, whether there is a need for systematic biopsy in the face of equivocal MRI findings to ensure no CSD is missed. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on prostate cancer referrals and prostate biopsy techniques within the UK; prior to the pandemic 65% of all prostate biopsies were TRUS, since the pandemic the proportions have reversed such that now over 65% of all prostate biopsies in the NHS are transperineal.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UDUeP9

At present, nucleic acid‐based techniques are primarily used as the reference approach for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, in several cases, false positive results have been observed with these techniques. Due to the drawbacks associated with existing techniques, the development of new techniques for the diagnosis of COVID‐19 is an important research activity.

If you are overweight and have other risk factors (see below), losing weight may reduce these risks. Experts recommend you try to lose weight if you have two or more of the following:Family history of certain chronic diseases. If you have close relatives who have had diseases such as heart disease or diabetes, you may be more likely to develop these problems. Pre-existing medical problems. High blood pressure, high LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, low HDL (good) cholesterol levels, high triglycerides, and high blood sugar (prediabetes or diabetes) are all warning signs of some diseases linked to obesity.

medical,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated significant alterations in ambulatory heart failure (HF) care, primarily with the introduction of telemedicine. We describe our initial experience caring for patients in the COVID-19 era in the Johns Hopkins Heart Failure Bridge Clinic (JHHFBC), an ambulatory disease management and diuresis clinic aimed at preventing hospitalizations. Methods The JHHFBC sees about 2500 patients per year with 25% of those patients needing intravenous diuretics in the clinic. Starting March 16, 2020, we implemented a COVID-specific workflow incorporating telemedicine, which the clinic had previously not been utilizing. Patient visit outcomes were adjudicated, including change in diuretic dosing, intravenous diuretic administration, and need for hospitalization. Results From March 16, 2020 to April 24, 2020 we had 116 patients seen 164 times (Figure 1). The average age of patients was 61 ± 14 years, 50% female, and 70% Black. Average left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 ± 21% with 45% nonischemic cardiomyopathy, 14% ischemic cardiomyopathy, 6% amyloid, 35% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The majority of patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III (109, 94%). Reasons for clinic referral included an equal frequency of post hospital discharge, worsening HF symptoms and routine follow up. Of the 96 telemedicine visits, 23% resulted in oral diuretic dose adjustment and 6 patients were referred for in-person visits. Of the 68 in-person visits, 34 (50%) resulted in intravenous diuretic administration in clinic, with 8 referrals to the emergency department or for direct admission. There were 2 referrals for cardioversion and 3 referrals to hospice by the clinic. Two of 16 clinic patients that were tested for Covid 19 were positive. Conclusion We found that HF patients could be effectively managed via telemedicine, however a subset still benefit from in-person assessment and access to ambulatory intravenous diuresis to avoid hospitalization. We hope these initial experiences will lend insights to optimization of future outpatient HF care, including the use of telemedicine, even after the current global health emergency.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",E1Usfm

medical,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has underlined the importance of adopting effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in hospital and community settings. UV-based technologies represent promising IPC tools: their effective application for sanitation has been extensively evaluated in the past but scant, heterogeneous and not conclusive evidence is available on their effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: With the aim of pooling the available evidence on the efficacy of UV technologies against coronaviruses, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library, and the main clinical trials’ registries (WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane and EU Clinical Trial Register). Quantitative data on studies’ interventionS were summarized in tables, pooled by different coronavirus species and strain, UV source, characteristics of UV light exposure and outcomes. FINDINGS: Eighteen papers met our inclusion criteria, published between 1972 and 2020. Six focused on SARS-CoV-2, four on SARS-CoV-1, one on MERS-CoV, three on seasonal coronaviruses, and four on animal coronaviruses. All were experimental studies. Overall, despite wide heterocenicity within included studies, complete inactivation of coronaviruses on surfaces or aerosolized, including SARS-CoV-2, was reported to take a maximum exposure time of 15 minutes and to need a maximum distance from the UV emitter up to 1 meter. CONCLUSION: Advances in UV-based technologies in the field of sanitation and their proved high virucidal potential against SARS-CoV-2 support their use for IPC in hospital and community settings and their contribution towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic. National and international guidelines are to be updated and identify parameters and conditions of use to ensure both efficacy and safety of UV technology application for effective infection prevention and control in both healthcare and non-healthcare settings.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lobKAe

medical,"In the present study, a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been investigated for the extraction of glycyrrhizin from Menthazin herbal drug. The extracted samples have been analyzed by a developed reversed-phase liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The separation was performed by a Eurospher-100 C(8) reversed-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm) and the mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile:water:glacial acetic acid (30:30:40:1 v/v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(−1). The extraction procedure has been screened by a two level full factorial design for determination of statistically significant parameters. Thereafter, the identified parameters, extraction temperature, time and solvent volume were optimized by a Box–Behnken design. The proposed mathematical model was based on analysis of variance results and correctly explained the behavior of the response in the experimental domain. R (2) value adjusted for numbers of degrees of freedom was 0.9915 and P-value for lack of fit, 0.8499 at the 95% confidence level, P > 0.05. The optimal condition identified were extraction temperature, 70 °C, time, 13.8 min and solvent volume 2.0 mL. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed MAE method, results were compared with those obtained with the liquid extraction method. Extraction efficiency and precision were higher when MAE has been used. The proposed method allows extracting the glycyrrhizin in a small quantity of solvent and faster than the liquid extraction method.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZEpyr1
medical,"Pancreatic Cancer: The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine. There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas. Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Neuroendocrine pancreas cells (such as islet cells) make several hormones, including insulin and glucagon, that help control sugar levels in the blood. Most pancreatic cancers form in exocrine cells. These tumors do not secrete hormones and do not cause signs or symptoms. This makes it hard to diagnose this type of pancreatic cancer early. For most patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. Some types of malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, such as islet cell tumors, have a better prognosis than pancreatic exocrine cancers. - Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. - Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. - Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. - Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. - Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. - Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. - Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV  - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed Stages I and II Pancreatic Cancer Treatment of stage I and stage II pancreatic cancer may include the following: - Surgery. - Surgery followed by chemotherapy. - Surgery followed by chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of combination chemotherapy. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, with or without chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery.

medical," Psoriasis Plaque psoriasis Psoriasis vulgaris Guttate psoriasis Pustular psoriasis Summary Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red, well-defined patches of skin with flaky, silver-white scales. These patches are called plaques. Causes Psoriasis is very common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 15 and 35, or as people get older. Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people. Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, this process takes place in days rather than in 3 to 4 weeks. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the collections of scales. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat: Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections Dry air or dry skin Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, insect bites, and other skin rashes Some medicines, including antimalaria drugs, beta-blockers, and lithium Stress Too little sunlight Too much sunlight (sunburn) Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people with HIV/AIDS. Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis (psoriatic arthritis). In addition, people with psoriasis have an increased risk of fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disorders, such as heart disease and stroke. Symptoms Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back. The main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky plaques of skin. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, soles of the feet, and genitalia. The skin may be: Itchy Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) Pink-red in color Raised and thick Other symptoms may include: Joint or tendon pain or aching Nail changes, including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, dents in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath Severe dandruff on the scalp There are five main types of psoriasis: Erythrodermic -- The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. Guttate -- Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form is often linked to strep infections, especially in children. Inverse -- Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin rather than the more common areas of the elbows and knees. Plaque -- Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis. Pustular -- Yellow pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin. Exams and Tests Your health care provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Sometimes, a skin biopsy is done to rule out other possible conditions. If you have joint pain, your provider may order imaging studies. Treatment The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos -- These are called topical treatments. Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin -- These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: Cortisone creams and ointments Other anti-inflammatory creams and ointments Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) Moisturizers Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids, such as acetretin, can also be used. Newer drugs, called biologics, are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: Adalimumab (Humira) Abatacept (Orencia) Apremilast (Otezla) Brodalumab (Siliq) Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) Etanercept (Enbrel) Infliximab (Remicade) Ixekizumab (Taltz) Golimumab (Simponi) Guselkumab (Tremfya) Ustekinumab (Stelara) Secukinumab (Cosentyx) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy, which is safe and can be very effective: This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: Taking a daily bath or shower -- Try not to scrub too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. Relaxation and anti-stress techniques -- The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. Support Groups Some people may benefit from a psoriasis support group. The National Psoriasis Foundation is a good resource: www.psoriasis.org. Outlook (Prognosis) Psoriasis can be a lifelong condition that can be usually controlled with treatment. It may go away for a long time and then return. With proper treatment, it will not affect your overall health. But be aware that there is a strong link between psoriasis and other health problems, such as heart disease. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you have symptoms of psoriasis or if your skin irritation continues despite treatment. Tell your provider if you have joint pain or fever with your psoriasis attacks. If you have symptoms of arthritis, talk to your dermatologist or rheumatologist. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a severe outbreak that covers all or most of your body. Prevention There is no known way to prevent psoriasis. Keeping the skin clean and moist and avoiding your psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. Providers recommend daily baths or showers for people with psoriasis. Avoid scrubbing too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Review Date 2/27/2018 Updated by: David L.

medical,"Disruption of the alveolar–endothelial barrier caused by inflammation leads to the progression of septic acute lung injury (ALI). In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects of simvastatin on the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and its related mechanisms. A model of ALI was induced within experimental sepsis developed by intraperitoneal injection of a single non-lethal LPS dose after short-term simvastatin pretreatment (10–40 mg/kg orally). The severity of the lung tissue inflammatory injury was expressed as pulmonary damage scores (PDS). Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL assay (DNA fragmentation) and expressed as an apoptotic index (AI), and immunohistochemically for cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome C, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, and transcriptional factor, NF-kB/p65. Severe inflammatory injury of pulmonary parenchyma (PDS 3.33 ± 0.48) was developed after the LPS challenge, whereas simvastatin significantly and dose-dependently protected lung histology after LPS (p < 0.01). Simvastatin in a dose of 40 mg/kg showed the most significant effects in amelioration alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis, demonstrating this as a marked decrease of AI (p < 0.01 vs. LPS), cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly enhanced the expression of Bcl-xL and survivin. Finally, the expression of survivin and its regulator NF-kB/p65 in the alveolar epithelium was in strong positive correlation across the groups. Simvastatin could play a protective role against LPS-induced ALI and apoptosis of the alveolar–endothelial barrier. Taken together, these effects were seemingly mediated by inhibition of caspase 3 and cytochrome C, a finding that might be associated with the up-regulation of cell-survival survivin/NF-kB/p65 pathway and Bcl-xL.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",m0ZQuc
medical,"Ultra Violet radiation, Chlorination, washing with soap and heating are some methods of sterilizing. Ultra Violet light is the best sterilizing and disinfectant agent, used for domestic as well as clinical purpose. Food packets, books, stationery, medical equipments, toys, electronic gadgets like mobile phones, laptops, wrist watches, etc can be sterilized with UV radiation whereas other methods of sterilization cannot be used. UV light does not release any waste and is eco-friendly, if used in a controlled manner. UV radiation is a range of electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelength (high frequency and energy). The wavelength from 100-280 nm known as UV-C is the best disinfectant used for purifying water, air, sterilizing vegetables and surgical equipments. Research has shown that UV-C wavelength can kill harmful fungi, protozoa, bacteria and viruses like SARS-CoV-2 Virus. The article describes the construction of a low cost UV-C Sterilizer Box where UV radiation is taking place in a closed environment.

medical,"The choices that researchers make while conducting a statistical analysis usually have a notable impact on the results. This fact has become evident in the ongoing research of the association between the environment and the evolution of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in light of the hundreds of contradictory studies that have already been published on this issue in just a few months. In this paper, a COVID-19 dataset containing the number of daily cases registered in the regions of Catalonia (Spain) since the start of the pandemic to the end of August 2020 is analysed using statistical models of diverse levels of complexity. Specifically, the possible effect of several environmental variables (solar exposure, mean temperature, and wind speed) on the number of cases is assessed. Thus, the first objective of the paper is to show how the choice of a certain type of statistical model to conduct the analysis can have a severe impact on the associations that are inferred between the covariates and the response variable. Secondly, it is shown how the use of spatio-temporal models accounting for the nature of the data allows understanding the evolution of the pandemic in space and time. The results suggest that even though the models fitted to the data correctly capture the evolution of COVID-19 in space and time, determining whether there is an association between the spread of the pandemic and certain environmental conditions is complex, as it is severely affected by the choice of the model.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lZbKE5

medical,"BACKGROUND: Surgical videos are now being used for performance review and educational purposes; however, broad use is still limited due to time constraints. To make video review more efficient, we implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect surgical workflow and technical approaches. METHODS: Participants (N = 200) performed a simulated open bowel repair. The operation included two major phases: (1) Injury Identification and (2) Suture Repair. Accordingly, a phase detection algorithm (MobileNetV2+GRU) was implemented to automatically detect the two phases using video data. In addition, participants were noted to use three different technical approaches when running the bowel: (1) use of both hands, (2) use of one hand and one tool, or (3) use of two tools. To discern the three technical approaches, an object detection (YOLOv3) algorithm was implemented to recognize objects that were commonly used during the Injury Identification phase (hands versus tools). RESULTS: The phase detection algorithm achieved high precision (recall) when segmenting the two phases: Injury Identification (86 ± 9% [81 ± 12%]) and Suture Repair (81 ± 6% [81 ± 16%]). When evaluating three technical approaches in running the bowel, the object detection algorithm achieved high average precisions (Hands [99.32%] and Tools [94.47%]). The three technical approaches showed no difference in execution time (Kruskal-Wallis Test: P= 0.062) or injury identification (not missing an injury) (Chi-squared: P= 0.998). CONCLUSIONS: The AI algorithms showed high precision when segmenting surgical workflow and identifying technical approaches. Automation of these techniques for surgical video databases has great potential to facilitate efficient performance review.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LfIafF

medical,"The main goal of this study is to compare the effects on public health of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to first wave in society. The paper here focuses on a case study of Italy, one of the first European countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Methodology considers daily data from February to November 2020 of the ratio of confirmed cases/total swabs, fatality rate (deaths / confirmed cases) and ratio of individuals in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) / Confirmed cases. Results reveal that the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy had a strong but declining impact on public health with the approaching of summer season and with the effects of containment measures, whereas second wave of the COVID-19 has a growing trend of confirmed cases with admission to ICUs and total deaths having a, to date, lower impact on public health compared to first wave. Although effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, policymakers have had an unrealistic optimist behavior that a new wave of COVID-19 could not hit their countries and, especially, a low organizational capacity to plan effective policy responses to cope with recurring COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

medical,"BACKGROUND This article summarizes comprehensive information about the current status of organ donation and transplantation in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS Reported statistical data of solid organs and vascularized composite allograft donation and transplantation from both deceased and living donors in Poland in 2015-2020 (presented in tables according to selected variables) are based on the national transplant registries, gathering information on donation and transplantation activity in medical centers involved in donation and transplantation programs in Poland. RESULTS In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, 529 potential deceased donors were referred to the Polish Transplant Coordinating Centre Poltransplant; 1310 solid organs from 393 actual deceased donors (10.2 per million population) were procured, mostly kidneys (758), livers (285), and hearts (157). Eighty percent were multiorgan retrievals (314). In 2020, 1231 organs procured from deceased donors and 59 organs from living donors were transplanted to 1236 recipients. CONCLUSION This overview indicates that donation and transplantation activity from deceased donors in Poland decreased about 20% in 2020 compared with 2019, which is comparable with worldwide rates. As the unprecedented pandemic situation affected donation and transplantation procedures, there are measures that must to be taken to return to prepandemic donation and transplantation rates in both deceased and living transplant programs and then continue to improve in the years to come.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0sNi7e

medical,"COVID‐19 caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 is pandemic with a severe morbidity and mortality rate across the world. Despite the race for effective vaccine and drug against further expansion and fatality rate of this novel coronavirus, there is still lack of effective antiviral therapy. To this effect, we deemed it necessary to identify potential B and T cell epitopes from the envelope S protein. This can be used as potential targets to develop anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine preparations. In this study, we used immunoinformatics to identify conservative B and T cell epitopes for S proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2, which might play roles in the initiation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We identified the B cell and T cell peptide epitopes of S protein and their antigenicity, as well as the interaction between the peptide epitopes and human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Among the B cell epitopes, ‘EILDITPCSFGGVS’ has the highest score of antigenicity and great immunogenicity. In T cell epitopes, MHC‐I peptide ‘KIADYNYKL’ and MHC‐II peptide ‘LEILDITPC’ were identified as high antigens. Besides, docking analysis showed that the predicted peptide ‘KIADYNYKL’ was closely bound to the HLA‐A*0201. The results of molecular dynamics simulation through GROMACS software showed that ‘HLA‐A*0201~peptide’ complex was very stable. And the peptide we selected could induce the T cell response similar to that of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Moreover, the predicted peptides were highly conserved in different isolates from different countries. The antigenic epitopes presumed in this study were effective new vaccine targets to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Y18yxg

medical,"Hello doctor,Around a year ago, some red pimples started appearing around my mouth, chin, forehead, and my nose. These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth.

medical,"I am a 21 year old female who has been suffering from chronic sciatica since july 2010. At first my doctor thought it would ease itself out and gave me diclofenac tablets which i cannot take as i suffer frequent heartburn so i returned to my gp and was changed to cocodamol codine. My sciatia \""episodes\"" only happened once or twice every week which left me in a lot of pain and extremely tired due to lack of sleep from the pain. Since the beggining of December my episodes started to become more frequent,  3/4 times a week, I tried heat packs, cold packs, gels, sprays, pillow between my legs, ibroufen, otc pain relievers. I reorted to walking around the living room at 4am most nights crying the pain was so severe. I have visited my gp numerous times and again she said it would work itself out. At the start of the year my episodes have been nearly everyday and it is extremely painful and i am finding it difficult to walk and bend down, even sitting is sore. Again I visited my gp and this time she gave me tramadol and told me to contact physiotherapy. My pain is a severe stabbing pain in my right buttock, (sometimes my left) my right hip, all the way down to my calf and the i have frequent pins and needles in my right foot. I also have a stabbing pain in between my shoulder blades and a dull thud in my lower back. Over the past few days I have been having extreme difficulty urinating, Im almost forcing my muscles to do so even though i am drinking plenty of fluids. I cannot tell you when i last had a bowel movement as its been that long. After a chat with my physiotherapist over the phone today she asked if i was experiencing theses symptoms and then i told her i had pain in my tail bone and sometimes a little shooting pain in my inner thigh, these symptoms have only started a few days ago. She called back an hour later with my next appointment but also to tell me that if i do not pass urine tonight that i must report to a+e tommorrow morning to be tested for cauda equina syndrome.

medical,"The operational and policy complexity of civil-military relations (CMR) during public health emergencies, especially those involving militaries from outside the state concerned, is addressed in several guiding international documents. Generally, these documents reflect humanitarian perspectives and doctrine at the time of their drafting, and primarily address foreign military involvement in natural and humanitarian disasters. However, in the past decade, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment and global health landscapes. Foreign militaries have been increasingly deployed to public health emergencies with responses grounded in public health (rather than humanitarian) approaches, while public health issues are of increasing importance in other deployments. This paper reviews key international policy documents that regulate, guide or otherwise inform CMR in the context of recent events involving international CMR during public health emergency responses, grounded in analysis of a March 2017 Chatham House roundtable event on the subject. Major thematic concerns regarding the application of existing CMR guiding documents to public health emergencies became evident. These include a lack of consideration of public health factors as distinct from a humanitarian approach; the assertion of state sovereignty vis-à-vis the deployment of national militaries; the emergence of new armed, military and security groups and a lack of consensus surrounding the 'principle of last resort'. These criticisms and gaps-in particular, a consideration for public health contexts and approaches therein-should form the basis of future CMR drafting or revision processes to ensure effective, safe, and sustainable CMR during public health emergency response.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",JCHABM

medical,"Renal involvement in patients with COVID-19 ranges from proteinuria and hematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI). The occurrence of AKI range from 0.5% to 80% across various studies. Our study was conducted to know the renal manifestations of COVID-19 in south Indian population and its association with severity. MATERIAL The study assessed COVID-19 positive adult patients admitted from 1/9/2020 to 31/10/2020. Data was collected by accessing electronic medical records of patients. Proteinuria and hematuria were assessed by urine dipstick. Lab data including S. Creatinine at admission was accessed. S. Creatinine at a mean duration of 7±2, 14±4 days during hospitalization and on follow-up at a mean duration of 45 days after discharge was also captured. OBSERVATION A total of 1561 patients admitted during the study period were screened. After the exclusion criteria, 426 patients admitted with COVID-19 infection were enrolled. The occurrence of AKI was 14.8%. Proteinuria was positive in 75 patients (17.6%) hematuria in 39 patients (9.15 %). Patients with AKI, proteinuria and/or hematuria were more likely to have severe COVID-19 illness. 47.5% patients with AKI, 45.9 % with proteinuria and 34.4 % with hematuria had severe COVID-19 illness. The recovery of AKI at a mean duration of 45±15 days post discharge was 83.63 %. CONCLUSION Renal involvement is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 infection especially in patients with severe illness.

medical,"The mechanism of oxidative decarboxylation of phenylsulfinylacetic acids (PSAA) by oxo(salen)Cr(V)(+) ion in the presence of ligand oxides has been studied spectrophotometrically in acetonitrile medium. Addition of ligand oxides (LO) causes a red shift in the λ(max) values of oxo(salen) complexes and an increase in absorbance with the concentration of LO along with a clear isobestic point. The reaction shows first-order dependence on oxo(salen)-chromium(V)(+) ion and fractional-order dependence on PSAA and ligand oxide. Michaelis–Menten kinetics without kinetic saturation was observed for the reaction. The order of reactivity among the ligand oxides is picoline N-oxide > pyridine N-oxide > triphenylphosphine oxide. The low catalytic activity of TPPO was rationalized. Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents in the phenyl ring of PSAA facilitate the reaction rate. The Hammett plots are non-linear upward type with negative ρ value for electron-donating substituents, (ρ(−) = −0.740 to −4.10) and positive ρ value for electron-withdrawing substituents (ρ(+) = +0.057 to +0.886). Non-linear Hammett plot is explained by two possible mechanistic scenarios, electrophilic and nucleophilic attack of oxo(salen)chromium(V)(+)-LO adduct on PSAA as the substituent in PSAA is changed from electron-donating to electron-withdrawing. The linearity in the log k vs. E(ox) plot confirms single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism for PSAAs with electron-donating substituents.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1ddLAW

medical,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injuries are the most common cause of olfactory dysfunction. Deficits in olfaction may be conductive or neurosensory in nature, with varying degrees of impairment resulting in a diminished quality of life and an increased risk for personal injury among patients. The aim of this research is to evaluate the results of the subjective and objective quantitative examinations of olfactory function in a group of patients with post-traumatic anosmia in order to predict its value in identifying olfactory deficits in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: The present study included 38 patients who reported anosmia or hyposmia caused by a traumatic head injury, and a group of 31 age- and sex-matched controls without olfactory dysfunction or prior history of head injury. The comparison of odor perception and identification of two oils (mint and anise) was assessed with the use of blast olfactometry with cortical olfactory event-related potentials. Results: Subjective olfactory tests revealed anosmia or hyposmia in 94% of patients with head injury-related olfactory dysfunction. Objective tests revealed olfactory event-related potentials from cranial nerve I produced by the stimulation with both mint and anise in 20 patients (52.6%). Olfactory event-related potentials from cranial nerve V produced by the stimulation with mint were registered in 26 patients (68.4%). The lack of any responses, from both cranial nerve I and V, was found in 12 patients (32% of cases). Conclusions: Findings from our study indicate the application of both subjective and objective examinations in the evaluation of patients with olfactory impairment. In the diagnosis of post-traumatic anosmia or hyposmia, objective examinations are particularly useful when the patients' level of cognition may be impaired or when subjects may be exaggerating their olfactory defects for a secondary gain. The diagnosis of damage to the olfactory system, specifically in the receptive part of the olfactory pathway, can be established in patients who showed reduced amplitudes or absent cortical responses in addition to absent odor identification and perception threshold in the subjective examination.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nlrgWX

medical,"Mesenteric ischemia is a serious complication of acute aortic dissection (AAD) and its early diagnosis is vital for prognosis and appropriate treatment indication. Arteries affected by this complication are the celiac trunk (CTr) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and their evaluation is usually based on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is also a useful technique for diagnosing AAD and is essential in monitoring surgical or endovascular treatment when CTA is not available. However, the usefulness of TEE for evaluating CTr and SMA involvement and mesenteric ischemia mechanisms in AAD is not well established. Real-time information on mesenteric malperfusion is needed at the bedside, in primary care facilities and the operating room to achieve prompt diagnosis and better therapeutic management.

medical,"The world needs to get out of the COVID-19 pandemic smoothly through a thorough socio-economic recovery. The first and the foremost step forward in this direction is the health recovery of the people infected. Our empirical study addresses this neglected point in the recent research on COVID-19 and specifically aims at exploring the impact of the environment on health recovery from COVID-19. The sample data are taken during the lockdown period in Wuhan, i.e., from 23rd January 2020 to 8th April 2020. The recently developed econometric technique of Quantile-on-Quantile regression, proposed by Shin and Zhu (2016) is employed to capture the asymmetric association between environmental factors (TEMP, HUM, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) and the number of recovered patients from COVID-19. We observe significant heterogeneity in the association among variables across various quantiles. The findings suggest that TEMP, PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, NO(2,) and O(3) are negatively related to the COVID-19 recovery, while HUM and SO(2) show a positive association at most quantiles. The study recommends that maintaining a safe and comfortable environment for the patients may increase the chances of recovery from COVID-19. The success story of Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the novel coronavirus in China, can serve as an important case study for other countries to bring the outbreak under control. The current study could be conducive for the policymakers of those countries where the COVID-19 pandemic is still unrestrained.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7jYQWL

In this short experimental paper, I focus on a more paradigmatic case: robot lying (lying being the textbook example of deception) for nonbeneficial purposes as judged from the human point of view. More precisely, I present an empirical experiment that investigates the following three questions: (a) Are ordinary people willing to ascribe deceptive intentions to artificial agents? (b) Are they as willing to judge a robot lie as a lie as they would be when human agents engage in verbal deception? (c) Do people blame a lying artificial agent to the same extent as a lying human agent? The response to all three questions is a resounding yes.

The goal of treatment is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible and bring the disease into remission. Lymphoma treatments include: - Active surveillance. Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant.

Until January 2021, systematic searches for English language papers were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Thirty observational studies were found after conducting systematic searches. The pooled overall prevalence of burnout was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40–63%]. Pooled emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and lack of personal accomplishment (PA) were 51% (95% CI 42–61%), 52% (95% CI 39–65%), and 28% (95% CI 25–31%), respectively. This study demonstrated that nearly half of the healthcare workers experienced burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the studies that were included, non-frontline COVID-19 exposed healthcare personnel also experienced burnout.

Patients access much of their material from health care providers through in-person visits, patient libraries, and in-person classes. Due to reductions in in-person visits throughout the pandemic, we sought to understand how PE programs responded under varying levels of COVID-19 restrictions to meet the information needs of patients and families. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to members of the Cancer Patient Education Network (CPEN) and the Health Care Education Association (HCEA) via the respective listservs. The survey consisted of five sections that included closed and opened questions. Participants were asked questions to describe their PE programs and how their duties were affected during the pandemic. Forty-two CPEN members completed the survey (N = 42, 66%) with a 35% response rate and a 55% completion rate, and 19 HCEA members completed the survey (N = 19, 30%) with a 5% response rate and 16% completion rate.

medical,"Here we present the first case of newly diagnosed IgA nephropathy (IgAN) after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A 30-year-old man with no known past medical history presented with gross hematuria and subnephrotic proteinuria 24 hours after the second dose of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A kidney biopsy showed IgAN. He was started on an angiotensin receptor blocker resulting in proteinuria reduction. Similar to natural infection of SARS-CoV2, persons who receive two mRNA-based vaccines demonstrate robust antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein. Given the uniqueness of glycosylation of RBD and potent stimulation of immune response from mRNA-based vaccine compared to other vaccines, we hypothesize that our patient developed de novo antibodies leading to IgA-containing immune-complex deposits. This case highlights the urgency of understanding the immunological responses to novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in more diverse populations.

medical,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, is a cause of great economic loss in the poultry industry. The virus mainly infects respiratory epithelium, but can be also detected in other organs. The functional receptor for the virus has not been found and field strains of IBV do not infect conventional cell lines. Recently, it has been shown that the C-type lectins DC-SIGN/L-SIGN can promote entry of several coronaviruses. Here we examine whether DC-SIGN/L-SIGN are entry determinants for IBV. We show that by introducing human DC-SIGN/L-SIGN into non-permissive cells, infection by the IBV is dramatically increased. DC-SIGN mediated infection was inhibited by mannan and anti-lectin antibodies, and was independent of sialic acid levels on the cell. Enhancement of IBV infection also occurred for different serotypes of IBV. Our findings demonstrated that even in the absence of avian-specific receptor, DC-SIGN-like lectins are capable of mediating efficient IBV infection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",CNo9VL

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The novel COVID-19 disease rapidly escalated into a global pandemic affecting people around the world. While communities imposed mitigation measures to stop the spread of the disease, the mass (home) confinement in addition to the uncertainty of the pandemic led to drastic changes in all aspects of life, including sleep. Sleep health is strongly linked with mental and overall health and could play a protective role against the development of mental distress during the pandemic. Here, we investigated sleep health in a global multicultural sample of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We surveyed 6,882 adults (18-94 years) across 59 countries about their sleep health (RU-SATED scale), sleep behaviors, demographics, pandemic-related factors, and mood between late April and early May 2020. A hierarchical stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to investigate correlates of sleep health. RESULTS: Compared with pre-pandemic times, more than one third of the sample reported an increase in sleep disturbances, and more than half of the sample shifted their sleep schedule towards later bed- and wake-up times. Better sleep health was associated with being partnered, older age and living in a higher-income country (p<.001). Poorer sleep health was associated with a stricter level of quarantine, and other pandemic-related factors including being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties with transitioning to working from home (R2=.116, p<.001). Domestic conflict emerged as the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health in the regression model. Greater depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with a poorer sleep health (p<.001). In a global comparison, Latin Americans reported the lowest sleep health scores. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight how sleep behavior has changed during the international quarantine- and isolation measurements and show the association between pandemic-related factors and poor sleep health, which, in turn, is closely linked with poorer mental health. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining good sleep health during the pandemic, since poorer sleep health may trigger or exacerbate mental disorders. Maintenance of good sleep health should be incorporated into public health messages aimed at helping people maintain optimal mental and physical health during major stressful life events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

medical,"There is limited knowledge on the yield of performing multiplex nucleic acid testing (NAT) on multiple lower respiratory tract specimens from a single patient with a single instance of infection. We evaluated the performance characteristics of multiplex NAT assays performed concurrently on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial wash (BW) specimens to detect respiratory pathogens. A retrospective study of admitted patients from March 2013 through December 2016 was performed. Individual performance characteristics of BAL and BW specimens were compared to positive results from either set of specimens. Only contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens (received by the laboratory within 4 h of each other) were included. The final cohort included 170 patients, with 184 contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens submitted for multiplex NAT (median age, 58 years; 62% male). Of the patients with positive NAT results, 38 of 40 BW specimens tested positive (overall percent agreement with combined testing, 98.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 95.5 to 98.9%), and 34 of 40 BAL specimens tested positive (overall percent agreement with combined testing, 96.7%; 95% CI, 93.0 to 96.7%). Assays performed on BW specimens identified 4 additional specimens and had a higher positive percent agreement (95.0%) with combined testing results compared to those performed on BAL specimens (85.0%). There was exact concordance in 174 specimens (94.6%; negative and positive for respiratory pathogens, 144 and 34 specimens, respectively). We observed high concordance (95%) between multiplex NAT results from contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens. Performance characteristics of BW specimen testing were equivalent to those of BAL specimen testing.

medical," Gastroparesis Definition and Facts Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from your stomach to your small intestine, even though there is no blockage in the stomach or intestines. What is gastroparesis? Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from your stomach to your small intestine. Normally, after you swallow food, the muscles in the wall of your stomach grind the food into smaller pieces and push them into your small intestine to continue digestion. When you have gastroparesis, your stomach muscles work poorly or not at all, and your stomach takes too long to empty its contents. Gastroparesis can delay digestion, which can lead to various symptoms and complications. How common is gastroparesis? Gastroparesis is not common. Out of 100,000 people, about 10 men and about 40 women have gastroparesis1. However, symptoms that are similar to those of gastroparesis occur in about 1 out of 4 adults in the United States2, 3. Who is more likely to get gastroparesis? You are more likely to get gastroparesis if youhave diabetes had surgery on your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine, which may injure the vagus nerve . The vagus nerve controls the muscles of the stomach and small intestine. had certain cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy on your chest or stomach area What other health problems do people with gastroparesis have? People with gastroparesis may have other health problems, such asdiabetes scleroderma hypothyroidism nervous system disorders, such as migraine, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) eating disorders amyloidosis What are the complications of gastroparesis? Complications of gastroparesis may includedehydration due to repeated vomiting malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels that are harder to control, which can worsen diabetes low calorie intake bezoars losing weight without trying lower quality of life Definition & Facts Symptoms and Causes The symptoms of gastroparesis may include feeling full shortly after starting a meal, feeling full long after eating a meal, nausea, and vomiting. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The symptoms of gastroparesis may includefeeling full soon after starting a meal feeling full long after eating a meal nausea vomiting too much bloating too much belching pain in your upper abdomen heartburn poor appetiteCertain medicines may delay gastric emptying or affect motility, resulting in symptoms that are similar to those of gastroparesis. If you have been diagnosed with gastroparesis, these medicines may make your symptoms worse. Medicines that may delay gastric emptying or make symptoms worse include the following:narcotic pain medicines, such as codeine , hydrocodone , morphine , oxycodone , and tapentadol some antidepressants , such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline , and venlafaxine some anticholinergics -medicines that block certain nerve signals some medicines used to treat overactive bladder pramlintideThese medicines do not cause gastroparesis. When should I seek a doctor’s help? You should seek a doctor's help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:severe pain or cramping in your abdomen blood glucose levels that are too high or too low red blood in your vomit, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds sudden, sharp stomach pain that doesn't go away vomiting for more than an hour feeling extremely weak or fainting difficulty breathing feverYou should seek a doctor's help if you have any signs or symptoms of dehydration, which may includeextreme thirst and dry mouth urinating less than usual feeling tired dark-colored urine decreased skin turgor, meaning that when your skin is pinched and released, the skin does not flatten back to normal right away sunken eyes or cheeks light-headedness or faintingYou should seek a doctor's help if you have any signs or symptoms of malnutrition, which may includefeeling tired or weak all the time losing weight without trying feeling dizzy loss of appetite abnormal paleness of the skin Symptoms & Causes In most cases, doctors aren't able to find the underlying cause of gastroparesis, even with medical tests. Gastroparesis without a known cause is called idiopathic gastroparesis.Diabetes is the most common known underlying cause of gastroparesis. Diabetes can damage nerves, such as the vagus nerve and nerves and special cells, called pacemaker cells, in the wall of the stomach. The vagus nerve controls the muscles of the stomach and small intestine. If the vagus nerve is damaged or stops working, the muscles of the stomach and small intestine do not work normally. The movement of food through the digestive tract is then slowed or stopped. Similarly, if nerves or pacemaker cells in the wall of the stomach are damaged or do not work normally, the stomach does not empty.In addition to diabetes, other known causes of gastroparesis includeinjury to the vagus nerve due to surgery on your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine hypothyroidism certain autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma certain nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis viral infections of your stomach Diagnosis Doctors diagnose gastroparesis based on your medical history, a physical exam, symptoms, and medical tests, such as tests to measure stomach emptying. Your doctor may use medical tests to look for gastroparesis complications. How do doctors diagnose gastroparesis? Doctors diagnose gastroparesis based on your medical history, a physical exam, your symptoms, and medical tests. Your doctor may also perform medical tests to look for signs of gastroparesis complications and to rule out other health problems that may be causing your symptoms.Your doctor will ask about your medical history. He or she will ask for details about your current symptoms and medicines, and current and past health problems such as diabetes, scleroderma, nervous system disorders, and hypothyroidism.Your doctor may also ask aboutthe types of medicines you are taking. Be sure to tell your doctor about all prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, and dietary supplements you are taking. whether you've had surgery on your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine whether you've had radiation therapy on your chest or stomach areaDuring a physical exam, your doctor willcheck your blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate check for signs of dehydration and malnutrition check your abdomen for unusual sounds, tenderness, or pain Diagnosis Doctors use lab tests, upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, imaging tests, and tests to measure how fast your stomach is emptying its contents to diagnose gastroparesis.Your doctor may use the following lab tests:Blood tests can show signs of dehydration, malnutrition, inflammation, and infection. Blood tests can also show whether your blood glucose levels are too high or too low. Urine tests can show signs of diabetes, dehydration, infection, and kidney problems.Your doctor may perform an upper GI endoscopy to look for problems in your upper digestive tract that may be causing your symptoms.Imaging tests can show problems, such as stomach blockage or intestinal obstruction, that may be causing your symptoms. Your doctor may perform the following imaging tests:upper GI series ultrasound of your abdomenYour doctor may perform one of more of the following tests to see how fast your stomach is emptying its contents.Gastric emptying scan, also called gastric emptying scintigraphy. For this test, you eat a bland meal-such as eggs or an egg substitute-that contains a small amount of radioactive material. A camera outside your body scans your abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. By tracking the radioactive material, a health care professional can measure how fast your stomach empties after the meal. The scan usually takes about 4 hours. Gastric emptying breath test. For this test, you eat a meal that contains a substance that is absorbed in your intestines and eventually passed into your breath. After you eat the meal, a health care professional collects samples of your breath over a period of a few hours-usually about 4 hours. The test can show how fast your stomach empties after the meal by measuring the amount of the substance in your breath. Wireless motility capsule, also called a SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device that you swallow. The capsule moves through your entire digestive tract and sends information to a recorder hung around your neck or clipped to your belt. A health care professional uses the information to find out how fast or slow your stomach empties, and how fast liquid and food move through your small intestine and large intestine. The capsule will pass naturally out of your body with a bowel movement. Treatment How doctors treat gastroparesis depends on the cause, how bad your symptoms and complications are, and how well you respond to different treatments. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor will help you control your blood glucose levels. How do doctors treat gastroparesis? How doctors treat gastroparesis depends on the cause, how severe your symptoms and complications are, and how well you respond to different treatments. Sometimes, treating the cause may stop gastroparesis. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your health care professional will work with you to help control your blood glucose levels. When the cause of your gastroparesis is not known, your doctor will provide treatments to help relieve your symptoms and treat complications.Changing your eating habits can help control gastroparesis and make sure you get the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids. Getting the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids can also treat the disorder's two main complications: malnutrition and dehydration.Your doctor may recommend that youeat foods low in fat and fiber eat five or six small, nutritious meals a day instead of two or three large meals chew your food thoroughly eat soft, well-cooked foods avoid carbonated, or fizzy, beverages avoid alcohol drink plenty of water or liquids that contain glucose and electrolytes, such as low-fat broths or clear soups naturally sweetened, low-fiber fruit and vegetable juices sports drinks oral rehydration solutions do some gentle physical activity after a meal, such as taking a walk avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal take a multivitamin each dayIf your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor may recommend drinking only liquids or eating well-cooked solid foods that have been processed into very small pieces or paste in a blender.If you have gastroparesis and diabetes, you will need to control your blood glucose levels, especially hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia may further delay the emptying of food from your stomach. Your doctor will work with you to make sure your blood glucose levels are not too high or too low and don't keep going up or down. Your doctor may recommendtaking insulin more often, or changing the type of insulin you take taking insulin after, instead of before, meals checking your blood glucose levels often after you eat, and taking insulin when you need itYour doctor will give you specific instructions for taking insulin based on your needs and the severity of your gastroparesis.Your doctor may prescribe medicines that help the muscles in the wall of your stomach work better. He or she may also prescribe medicines to control nausea and vomiting and reduce pain.Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines:Metoclopramide. This medicine increases the tightening, or contraction, of the muscles in the wall of your stomach and may improve gastric emptying. Metoclopramide may also help relieve nausea and vomiting. Domperidone. This medicine also increases the contraction of the muscles in the wall of your stomach and may improve gastric emptying. However, this medicine is available for use only under a special program administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Erythromycin. This medicine also increases stomach muscle contraction and may improve gastric emptying. Antiemetics. Antiemetics are medicines that help relieve nausea and vomiting. Prescription antiemetics include ondansetron , prochlorperazine , and promethazine. Over-the-counter antiemetics include bismuth subsalicylate and diphenhydramine . Antiemetics do not improve gastric emptying. Antidepressants. Certain antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, may help relieve nausea and vomiting. These medicines may not improve gastric emptying. Pain medicines. Pain medicines that are not narcotic pain medicines may reduce pain in your abdomen due to gastroparesis.In some cases, your doctor may recommend oral or nasal tube feeding to make sure you're getting the right amount of nutrients and calories. A health care professional will put a tube either into your mouth or nose, through your esophagus and stomach, to your small intestine. Oral and nasal tube feeding bypass your stomach and deliver a special liquid food directly into your small intestine.If you aren't getting enough nutrients and calories from other treatments, your doctor may recommend jejunostomy tube feeding. Jejunostomy feedings are a longer term method of feeding, compared to oral or nasal tube feeding.Jejunostomy tube feeding is a way to feed you through a tube placed into part of your small intestine called the jejunum. To place the tube into the jejunum, a doctor creates an opening, called a jejunostomy, in your abdominal wall that goes into your jejunum. The feeding tube bypasses your stomach and delivers a liquid food directly into your jejunum.Your doctor may recommend parenteral, or intravenous (IV), nutrition if your gastroparesis is so severe that other treatments are not helping. Parenteral nutrition delivers liquid nutrients directly into your bloodstream. Parenteral nutrition may be short term, until you can eat again. Parenteral nutrition may also be used until a tube can be placed for oral, nasal, or jejunostomy tube feeding. In some cases, parental nutrition may be long term.Your doctor may recommend a venting gastrostomy to relieve pressure inside your stomach. A doctor creates an opening, called a gastrostomy, in your abdominal wall and into your stomach. The doctor then places a tube through the gastrostomy into your stomach. Stomach contents can then flow out of the tube and relieve pressure inside your stomach.Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) uses a small, battery-powered device to send mild electrical pulses to the nerves and muscles in the lower stomach. A surgeon puts the device under the skin in your lower abdomen and attaches wires from the device to the muscles in the wall of your stomach. GES can help decrease long-term nausea and vomiting.GES is used to treat people with gastroparesis due to diabetes or unknown causes only, and only in people whose symptoms can't be controlled with medicines. Treatment Gastroparesis without a known cause, called idiopathic gastroparesis, cannot be prevented.If you have diabetes, you can prevent or delay nerve damage that can cause gastroparesis by keeping your blood glucose levels within the target range that your doctor thinks is best for you. Meal planning, physical activity, and medicines, if needed, can help you keep your blood glucose levels within your target range. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition What you eat can help relieve gastroparesis symptoms. What you eat can also help make sure you get the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids if you are malnourished or dehydrated due to gastroparesis. How can my diet help prevent or relieve gastroparesis? What you eat can help prevent or relieve your gastroparesis symptoms. If you have diabetes, following a healthy meal plan can help you manage your blood glucose levels. What you eat can also help make sure you get the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids if you are malnourished or dehydrated from gastroparesis. What should I eat and drink if I have gastroparesis? If you have gastroparesis, your doctor may recommend that you eat or drinkfoods and beverages that are low in fat foods and beverages that are low in fiber five or six small, nutritious meals a day instead of two or three large meals soft, well-cooked foodsIf you are unable to eat solid foods, your doctor may recommend that you drinkliquid nutrition meals solid foods pureed in a blenderYour doctor may also recommend that you drink plenty of water or liquids that contain glucose and electrolytes, such aslow-fat broths and clear soups low-fiber fruit and vegetable juices sports drinks oral rehydration solutionsIf your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor may recommend drinking only liquids or eating well-cooked solid foods that have been processed into very small pieces or paste in a blender. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition If you have gastroparesis, you should avoidfoods and beverages that are high in fat foods and beverages that are high in fiber foods that can't be chewed easily carbonated, or fizzy, beverages alcoholYour doctor may refer you to a dietitian to help you plan healthy meals that are easy for you to digest and give you the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a simple, rapid urine test based on the level of foaming that occurs in the urine sample due to the excretion of peptide structures containing amino acids specific to the antigenic structure of COVID-19. In this study, we present the preliminary results of the first clinical study with a newly developed urine foaming test (UFT). METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Istanbul. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee, urine samples were taken from three groups of patients whose informed consent was obtained. The groups were created according to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Guide of Ministry of Health: A: outpatients with suspected COVID-19, B: inpatients for follow-up and treatment, C: patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU). Also, 30 healthy volunteers were included as the control group D. Urine samples taken from all groups were delivered to the laboratory. 2.5 ml urine sample was added to the test tube and shaken for 15 seconds and the level of foam formed was visually evaluated according to the color scale. Other data of the patients were obtained from the hospital information management system and the physician caring for the patient. The clinical status, PCR test results, computed tomography (CT), if any, laboratory tests, and UFT results were compared and the level of statistical significance was expressed as p≤0.05 in the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Performance characteristics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the UFT, were statistically calculated according to the RT-PCR result and/or CT. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed between UFT distributions of the control, outpatient, inpatient and ICU patients (p=0.0001). The results of UFT orange and red in inpatients and ICU patients were statistically significantly higher than in the control and outpatient groups. The diagnostic accuracy of UFT was detected in all group, the pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 87–95%) and specificity was 89% (95% CI: 80–98%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that the UFT is useful, particularly in predicting the clinical severity of COVID-19. The UFT could be recommended as a point of care test, rapid and non-invasive method in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KDgRrm
medical,"A new disease, severe atypical respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerged in China in late 2002 and developed into the first epidemic of the 21st century. The disease was caused by an unknown animal coronavirus (CoV) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals, and was identified as the etiological agent for SARS. This new CoV not only became readily transmissible between humans but also was also more pathogenic. The disease spread across the world rapidly due to the air travel, and infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents. The disease is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including high fever, malaise, cough, diarrhea, and infiltrates visible on chest radiography. The overall mortality was about 10%, but varied profoundly with age; the course of disease seemed to be milder in the pediatric age group and resulted rarely in a fatal outcome, but the mortality in the elderly was as high as 50%. Aggressive quarantine measures taken by the health authorities have successfully contained and terminated the disease transmission. As a result there are no SARS cases recorded recently. Nevertheless there is a possibility that the disease may emerge in the population with high vigor. Significant progress has been made in understanding the disease biology, pathogenesis, development of animal models, and design and evaluation of different vaccines, and these are the focus of this chapter.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LzvGJX

medical,"UHRF1 is a key regulator in DNA methylation maintenance. It binds histone H3K9me2/3 and hemi-methylated DNA and recruits DNMT1 to DNA replication forks during S phase. However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_CG4Zy

medical,"There are few evidence-based data on the actual duration of breastfeeding, on the reasons for weaning, or on the development and growth of infants fed with infant formula. Evaluating this is an important aspect of the discussion of preventive measures. The aim of the current project was to observe new-borns/infants, who were fed with infant formula PRE or one of the “Zurück zum Ursprung” (Back to the Origin; Company Hofer KG, Sattledt, Austria) products after weaning, with regard to growth (length, weight), acceptance and any other abnormalities, and to evaluate the results. Furthermore, emerging nutrition-related questions that the mothers asked during counselling were documented. Seventeen new-borns/infants were observed over a period of 6 months, at seven consultations, approximately 4 weeks apart, and their length and weight were measured. The results were then evaluated using age-appropriate percentiles. In addition, acceptance was assessed and any abnormalities were documented. Questions on nutrition-related issues were discussed with the mothers based on evidence-based information. Except for one infant, who was already well above the 97th percentile at the start of the observation, all the other 16 infants showed a developmentally appropriate physiological course of length and weight. The formula milk was accepted by all infants without exception. The mothers’ emerging questions and nutritional issues showed that practical tips based on evidence-based facts were preferred to so-called “general recommendations” from companies or the media. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the observation was continued on a smaller scale as a pilot study and produced interesting results. As a future perspective, long-term observation of the monitored babies would be interesting, in order to be able to gain important knowledge for preventive nutritional measures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8dCnWa

medical,I have had back pain and been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease as well as stenosis of the spine. I am 37 and my pain began when I was 19. That s when i decided to get help the first time. The remedy and news were depressing that it won t get better. I have had a discectomy about 8 years ago and during rehab fractured a pedicule in the spine causing what honestly felt like lava flowing through the veins in my legs. It was extremely painful. After time that pain subsided as I healed but I have always had back pain. I haven t felt my left thigh for over 15 years now. I should also mention that I have also had recurring pilonidal cysts below my tailbone and I had the last surgery roughly 3 years ago and thankfully have not had one of those monsters since. However along with the normal (my normal) back pain and numbness in my left thigh I have been experiencing a sensation as if I were sitting on a cell phone on vibrate. It is fairly consistent for the past couple of weeks and there is no additional pain. I am currently prescribed zubsolv as it helps to keep my mind off the pain I have and does not give me the bad side effects of pain killers like oxymorphone. I am more active than I was from age 25 to 35 but I am still overweight even after losing 85lbs. Is my degeneration or stenosis getting worse now that I am more active? I am a delivery driver for the past year and in addition to carrying 20-30lbs I also am in and out of a car 30-40 times a day. Any advice you can give me would be most appreciated!

On the one hand, the challenge is how to effectively capture the cross-series correlations between interacting time series, to achieve accurate distribution modeling. On the other hand, we should consider how to capture the contextual information within time series more accurately to model multivariate temporal dynamics of time series. In this work, we proposed a novel non-autoregressive deep learning model, called Multi-scale Attention Normalizing Flow(MANF), where we integrate multi-scale attention and relative position information and the multivariate data distribution is represented by the conditioned normalizing flow. Additionally, compared with autoregressive modeling methods, our model avoids the influence of cumulative error and does not increase the time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on many popular multivariate datasets.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",K-h4IE

The following paper discusses how these circumstances (e.g., stay-at-home orders, school closures, changes in pediatric healthcare delivery) impact disease management at the individual, family, community, and healthcare system levels. We also discuss how barriers to pediatric adherence and self-management exacerbated by the pandemic may disproportionately affect underserved and vulnerable populations, potentially resulting in greater health disparities. Given the potential for widespread challenges to pediatric disease management during the pandemic, ongoing monitoring and promotion of adherence and self-management is critical. Technology offers several opportunities for this via telemedicine, electronic monitoring, and mobile apps. Moreover, pediatric psychologists are uniquely equipped to develop and implement adherence-promotion efforts to support youth and their families in achieving and sustaining optimal disease management as the current public health situation continues to evolve.

My only problem was aggressive BM, not diarrhea but a lot of gas after getting up in morning followed by first BM and then another BM in a span of two hours. I weighed 79 kg seven months back and did drop to 72 kg weighed last month. The doctor says this weight loss is clinically not scary. I did consult another doctor who says this to be gut flora imbalance and not IBS as I have not had any relief from IBS medication and he believes my symptoms does not correlate with typical IBS. At present, I have a frequent passing of gas, especially after eating food or dinner. In the morning BM is smooth however I do feel the gas and pressure again in three hours time and this trend is regular. The stomach gets settled after second BM.

medical," Staph infections - self-care at home Staphylococcus infections - self care at home Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections - self care at home MRSA infections - self care at home Summary Staph (pronounced staff) is short for Staphylococcus. Staph is a type of germ (bacteria) that can cause infections almost anywhere in the body. One type of staph germ, called methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MRSA), is harder to treat. This is because MRSA is not killed by certain medicines used to treat other staph germs. How Does Staph Spread? Many healthy people normally have staph on their skin, in their noses, or other body areas. Most of the time, the germ does not cause an infection or symptoms. This is called being colonized with staph. These persons are known as carriers. They can spread staph to others. Some people colonized by staph develop an actual staph infection that makes them sick. Most staph germs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. They can also be spread when you touch something that has the staph germ on it, such as clothing or a towel. Staph germs can then enter a break in the skin, such as cuts, scratches, or pimples. Usually the infection is minor and stays in the skin. But the infection can spread deeper and affect the blood, bones, or joints. Organs such as the lungs, heart, or brain can also be affected. Serious cases can be life-threatening. What are the Risk Factors for Staph Infection? You are more likely to get a staph infection if you: Have an open cut or sore Inject illegal drugs Have a medical tube such as urinary catheter or feeding tube Have a medical device inside your body such as an artificial joint Have a weakened immune system or ongoing (chronic) illness Live with or have close contact with a person who has staph Play contact sports or share athletic equipment Share items such as towels, razors, or cosmetics with others Recently stayed in a hospital or long-term care facility How Do You Know If You Have a Staph Infection? Symptoms depend on where the infection is located. For example, with a skin infection you may have a boil or a painful rash called impetigo. With a serious infection, such as toxic shock syndrome, you may have a high fever, nausea and vomiting, and a sunburn-like rash. The only way to know for sure if you have a staph infection is by seeing a health care provider. A cotton swab is used to collect a sample from an open skin rash or skin sore. A blood, urine, or sputum sample may also be collected. The sample is sent to a lab to test for staph. If staph is found, it will be tested to see which antibiotic should be used to treat your infection. Treatment If test results show you have a staph infection, treatment may include: Taking antibiotics Cleaning and draining the wound Surgery to remove an infected device Preventing Staph Infection Follow these steps to avoid a staph infection and prevent it from spreading. Keep your hands clean by washing them thoroughly with soap and water. Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with bandages until they heal. Avoid contact with other people's wounds or bandages. Do not share personal items such as towels, clothing, or cosmetics. Simple steps for athletes include: Cover wounds with a clean bandage. Do not touch other people's bandages. Wash your hands well before and after playing sports. Shower right after exercising. Do not share soap, razors, or towels. If you share sports equipment, clean it first with antiseptic solution or wipes. Use clothing or a towel between your skin and the equipment. Do not use a common whirlpool or sauna if another person with an open sore used it. Always use clothing or a towel as a barrier. Do not share splints, bandages, or braces. Check that shared shower facilities are clean. If they are not clean, shower at home. Review Date 5/21/2017 Updated by: Laura J.

medical,"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers increasingly encounter serious ethical issues that negatively affect their professionalism. PURPOSE: The study aims to examine the ethical sensitivity levels of physicians and nurses working in surgical units during the Covid-19 pandemic and the associating factors. METHOD: The sample of this cross-sectional online questionnaire-based study consists of 161 healthcare workers working at the surgical units in Turkish hospitals. The data were collected using the ""Nurse Descriptive Information Form"" developed by the researchers and the ""Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire."" ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approval was granted by the ethics committee. Verbal and written consent was received from the healthcare workers. RESULTS: Ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict was found to be higher in healthcare workers who had ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were married, who were nurses, who worked more than 45 h, and who had a work experience of 7-10 years (p < 0.05). Healthcare workers with a family member diagnosed with Covid-19 had high ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict (p = 0.008), while those who reported being fully competent and ready (p = 0.038) about Covid-19 were found to have low ethical sensitivity. Besides, those who experienced inadequate supplies (p = 0.045), long working hours (p = 0.038), and problems in asepsis-sterilization (p = 0.046) during the Covid-19 pandemic were found to have low sensitivity in the holistic approach dimension. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge-skills about Covid-19, and the problems encountered in the work environment during the pandemic affect the ethical sensitivity of healthcare workers in the dimensions of conflict and holistic approach. Therefore, it is recommended that governments and all healthcare workers, and stakeholders in the health system in our country and other countries take action to promote ethical sensitivity in response to the rapidly increasing epidemic by considering the factors that adversely affect ethical sensitivity.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2ceO3H

It also explored the mediating role of stigma and life satisfaction on the association between resilience and intention to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination. DESIGN: An anonymous cross‐sectional survey. METHODS: 1733 HCWs from five hospitals in four provinces of mainland China completed a cross‐sectional online survey in October and November 2020. RESULTS: Among the HCWs, the rate of intention to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination was 73.1%. Results from structural equation modelling showed that resilience was associated both directly, and indirectly with greater intent to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination through two pathways: first by increasing life satisfaction, and second by reducing stigma and increasing life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Promoting the resilience of HCWs has the potential to increase the COVID‐19 vaccination uptake rate among HCWs in China. IMPACT: This study tested the relationship between several psychological factors and the COVID‐19 vaccination intention of HCWs in China, finding that resilience played a significant role in improving COVID‐19 vaccination intention rates by reducing stigma and increasing life satisfaction.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",U7bC-o

medical,"Abstract Objectives: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused approximately 2,350,000 infections worldwide and killed more than 160,000 individuals. In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. Methods: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ + standard treatment). Conclusion: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects. Résumé Objectifs: La pandémie mondiale actuelle de COVID-19 a touché environ 2 350 000 personnes et fait plus de 160 000 morts. Nous avons observé dans le GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (site Sainte-Anne, Paris, France) une incidence moins importante de formes symptomatiques de COVID-19 chez les patients que dans notre personnel soignant. Notre hypothèse est que les traitements psychotropes pourraient avoir une action prophylactique sur le SARS-CoV-2. Cette hypothèse est cohérente avec les propriétés antivirales connues de plusieurs psychotropes au premier rang desquels la chlorpromazine (CPZ). En plus de ses effets antipsychotiques classiques, plusieurs études in vitro ont également démontré une activité antivirale de cette phénothiazine via l'inhibition de l'endocytose dépendante des clathrines. Récemment, des études ont révélé un effet anti-MERS-CoV et anti-SARS-CoV-1 de la CPZ. Méthodes: Dans ce contexte, l’étude reCoVery, basée sur le repositionnement de la CPZ -molécule avec un excellent profil de tolérance et une biodistribution très élevée dans la salive, les poumons et le cerveau - vise à tester l’hypothèse que la CPZ pourrait diminuer l’évolution défavorable de l’infection COVID-19 chez des patients oxygénorequérants sans nécessité de soins en réanimation mais aussi réduire la contagiosité du SARS-CoV-2. Nous allons réaliser pour cela un essai thérapeutique pilote de phase III multicentrique, randomisé, contrôlé (traitement standard vs. CPZ + traitement standard) et en simple insu. Conclusion: Le repositionnement de la CPZ comme antiviral anti-SARS-CoV-2 offre une stratégie alternative et rapide pour atténuer la propagation du virus ainsi que la gravité et la létalité du COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BNltUc

medical,"The mutual agreement procedure (MAP) has long been criticized. From the perspective of transaction cost theory, the deficiencies of the mechanism primarily reflect three types of transaction costs: agency cost, bargaining cost, and administrative cost, all of which can be economized via the digitalization of international tax dispute resolution (ITDR) processes. The impetus for the development of digital ITDR becomes more prominent considering the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, compared with dispute resolution mechanisms in many other domains, the ITDR process particularly lends itself to digital facilitation. However, data from peer review reports under Action 14 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project shows that the international practice of the digital ITDR still remains at a rudimentary stage. This underdevelopment can largely be attributed to a decentralized approach to the ITDR development at the international level. In this regard, it is proposed that the OECD can play a greater role in leading and coordinating the development of digital ITDR at the global level. In particular, a global digital platform is envisaged to facilitate the digital ITDR processes among competent authorities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RbNWcg

medical,"In clinical treatment, deep learning plays a pivotal role in medical image classification. Deep learning techniques provide opportunities for radiologists and orthopedic to ease out their lives with faster and more accurate results. The traditional deep learning approach nevertheless reached its performance ceiling. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate different enhancement techniques to boost the deep neural networks performance and provide a solution as BoostNet. The experiment is categorized into four different phases. We have selected ChampNet from benchmark deep learning models (EfficientNet: B0, MobileNet, ResNet18, VGG19). This phase helps to obtain the best model. In the second phase, The ChampNet evaluates with different resolution datasets. This phase helps to finalize the dataset resolution to enhance the performance of ChampNet. In the third phase, Champ-Net merges with image enhancement techniques, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), High-frequency filtering (HEF), and Unsharp masking (UM). This phase helps to obtain Boost-Net with enriched performance. The last phase helps us to verify BoostNet results with Lightness Order Error. The presented research work fuses the image enhancement technique with ChampNet to generate BoostNet models. An assessment was performed on the Musculoskeletal Radiograph Bone Classification using classification schemes to demonstrate the proposed model's performance. The Classification accuracy of BoostNet was for the train a test dataset with and without enhancement techniques. The proposed model ChampNet + CLAHE, ChampNet + HEF, ChampNet + UM approach achieved 95.88%, 94.99%, and 94.18% accuracy, respectively. This experiment leads to a more accurate and efficient classification model. The main aim of this paper is to enhance techniques to boost the deep neural networks performance and provide a solution as BoostNet.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",myBjhV

medical,"Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is a class of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) which causes problems in both clinical and research settings. It is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the majority of western countries and is a major cause of attrition of novel drug candidates. Manual trawling of literature for is the main route of deriving information on DILI from research studies. This makes it an inefficient process prone to human error. Therefore, an automatized AI model capable of retrieving DILI-related papers from the huge ocean of literature could be invaluable for the drug discovery community. In this project, we built an artificial intelligence (AI) model combining the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to address this problem. This model uses NLP to filter out meaningless text (e.g. stopwords) and uses customized functions to extract relevant keywords as singleton, pair, triplet and so on. These keywords are processed by apriori pattern mining algorithm to extract relevant patterns which are used to estimate initial weightings for a ML classifier. Along with pattern importance and frequency, an FDA-approved drug list mentioning DILI adds extra confidence in classification. The combined power of these methods build a DILI classifier (DILIC) with 94.91% cross-validation and 94.14% external validation accuracy. To make DILIC as accessible as possible, including to researchers without coding experience, an R Shiny App capable of classifing single or multiple entries for DILI is developed to enhance ease of user experience and made available at https://researchmind.co.uk/diliclassifier/).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8g51fd

medical,"INTRODUCTION The fourth sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, COVID-19, emerged in late 2019, leading to the most devastating pandemic since the Spanish influenza (H1N1) of 1918, which seized 50 million lives worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html). Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies. DISCUSSION The authors suggest improvements in bridging science to application by making COVID-19 informatics more meaningful and actionable by lawmakers, businesspersons, and the public. Limitations and future directions for COVID-19 informatics are discussed.

medical,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by acute clinical pathologies, including various coagulopathies that may be accompanied by hypercoagulation and platelet hyperactivation. Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6 months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma clots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits. We also show that these anomalous deposits in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in (2)-antiplasmin (2AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might therefore benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2mmRn7

In this report, we show that the murine hepatitis virus nsp2 sequence was tolerated in ORF1b with an in-frame insertion between nsp13 and nsp14 and in place of ORF4. Alternate encoding or duplication of the nsp2 gene sequence resulted in differences in nsp2 expression, processing, and localization, was neutral or detrimental to replication, and did not complement an ORF1a Deltansp2 replication defect.

medical,"A pilot study of COVID-19 patients treated with mesenchymal stem cells demonstrates safety. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapies, which have been explored for decades as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, are now being called into action to combat the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 may be due in part to the patient's response to the infection. In some patients, the virus induces an outpouring of inflammatory mediators that leads to swelling, inflammatory infiltration, and reduced gas exchange in the alveoli of the lungs. To combat this cytokine storm, over 20 clinical trials aiming to treat COVID-19 with MSCs have been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Leng et al. recently conducted a pilot study of MSC transplantation in 10 patients in China. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and oxygen saturation at rest &lt;95%. Seven of the patients received intravenous infusions of allogeneic MSCs while three received saline as a placebo control. All seven MSC treated patients experienced resolution of symptoms while one of the placebo-treated patients went on to develop ARDS and another died. The response of the most severely ill patient treated with MSCs was monitored throughout recovery. Of note, C-reactive protein levels dropped 10-fold after MSC treatment, suggesting a drop in systemic inflammation. Analysis of cytokine levels before and after treatment revealed that MSC treatment, but not placebo, was associated with a halt in the increase of serum tumor necrosis factor–α and an increase in anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 concentrations in the serum. Although this study is not designed to make definitive claims regarding the efficacy of MSC therapy for COVID-19 or the mechanisms by which MSCs may function to prevent or treat cytokine storm, it does provide important safety data and hints of efficacy that have motivated further exploration of MSCs as a treatment for COVID-19. Of particular note is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 trial enrolling 240 patients being conducted through a public-private partnership between the U.S. National Institutes of Health–funded Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network and Mesoblast. As multiple clinical trials are launched around the world, we should not have to wait long to determine if MSCs are a viable and effective treatment option for severe COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",wiM7D5
medical,"Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have affected populations worldwide. Our literature review summarises the studies reporting psychological issues among healthcare staff and infected patients in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan during these two outbreaks and the potential strategies for addressing these issues. Our review shows that patients and healthcare staff presented similar psychological symptoms, including anxiety, fear, distress, and depression, which may lead to stress-related complications such as insomnia. In patients, these psychological impairments can be contributed to by being quarantined, perceptions of threats to life, and uncertainty about health status. Quarantine is also a factor for distress among healthcare staff, together with their heavy workload, the fear that they and their families would become infected, witnessing their patients’ poor and deteriorating conditions, and the requirement to wear protective gear. Strategies that are needed to address these factors include providing counselling services, implementing mindfulness-based therapies and optimism interventions, and providing telecommunication facilities for patients to communicate with their families. Healthcare staff should also be provided with these services, together with appropriate and flexible work shift arrangements and morale boosting. These strategies would improve not only the mental well-being of patients and healthcare staff, but also the self-efficacy and competence of the staff to provide quality healthcare services.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",J39CEu

University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. METHODS: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Six negative predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students' psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students' psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. CONCLUSION: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students' psychological wellbeing.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",YE22UT

We screened five commercially available libraries (7039 compounds in total) to identify 83 inhibitors with IC(50) < 50 μM, which were further validated using RP HPLC and dot blot assays. Novel fluorescence anisotropy binding assays were developed to examine the targeted binding site.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial cytokines including IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TLSP) are recently established as drivers of type 2 chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Here, we further confirmed the increased expression of IL-25 in CRSwNP and investigated potential contributors of IL-25 in CRSwNP epithelium. METHODS: Sixty CRSwNP, 25 CRSsNP and 15 healthy control tissues were examined for IL-25 expression and for the accompanying type 2 inflammatory cytokines. We then tested different respiratory virus infections on human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) for their ability to trigger IL-25 expression. In addition, we subjected hNECs generated from CRSwNP tissues to pretreatment with recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-α) prior to viral infection to evaluate IFN effects on IL-25 induction. RESULTS: We confirmed that significantly enhanced levels of IL-25 were observed in CRSwNP tissues, and that IL-25 expression correlated with type 2 inflammatory cytokine expression. In vitro, we observed significantly elevated IL-25 in hNECs infected with influenza A virus as early as 24 hours post-infection (hpi), regardless of tissue origin, and IL-25 correlated positively with viral load. While other respiratory viruses exhibited increasing trends of IL-25, these were not significant at the time-points tested. IFN-α treatment of CRSwNP epithelium was found to exert bimodal effects, ie IFN-α treatment alone induced moderate IL-25 expression, whereas IFN-α pretreatment of hNECs before influenza infection significantly diminished IL-25 induction by active influenza virus infection. CONCLUSION: We have authenticated the observation of elevated IL-25 in CRSwNP, which is correlated with type 2 inflammatory cytokines. Notably, we identified influenza virus infection as a potential contributor of IL-25 in both control and CRSwNP epithelium during active infection. This IL-25 induction can be abated by IFN-α pretreatment which ameliorated active influenza infection.

In this review, we aim to summarize recent advances on how reprogrammed lipid metabolism and accompanying signaling cascades directly modulate cancer cells, as well as influencing stromal cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. For future studies, special attention should be paid to lipid-mediated crosstalk among cancer cells, their neighboring stromal cells, and immune cells, plus how these multi-level communications determine anti-tumor immunity and bring novel immunotherapeutic opportunities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",VkeukS

medical,"Determining the severity of a novel pathogen in the early stages is difficult in the absence of reliable data. The pattern of outbreaks for COVID-19 across the globe have differed markedly above and below +40N latitudes, suggesting very different levels of severity, but countries worldwide have implemented the same lockdown strategies. Existing methods for estimating severity appear not to have been useful in informing strategic decisions, possibly due to mismatches between the data required and those available, overly sophisticated methods with undesirable biases, or perhaps confusion and uncertainly generated by the wide range of estimates these methods produced early on. The Epidemic Severity Index (ESI) is a simple, robust method for estimating the local severity of novel epidemic outbreaks using early and widely-available data and that does not depend on any estimated values. ESI allows rapid, meaningful comparisons across territories that can be tracked as the outbreaks unfold. The ESI quantifies severity relative to a parameterised baseline rather than attempting to estimate values for infection fatality rates, case fatality rates or transmission rates. The relative nature of the ESI sidesteps any problems of confidence associated with absolute rate estimation methods and offers immediate practical strategic value.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Rr3Dzz

medical,"Natural products can act as potential GABA modulators, avoiding the undesirable effects of traditional pharmacology used for the inhibition of the central nervous system such as benzodiazepines (BZD). Phenolics, especially flavonoids and phlorotannins, have been considered as modulators of the BZD-site of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), with sedative, anxiolytic or anticonvulsant effects. However, the wide chemical structural variability of flavonoids shows their potential action at more than one additional binding site on GABA(A)Rs, which may act either negatively, positively, by neutralizing GABA(A)Rs, or directly as allosteric agonists. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to compile and discuss an update of the role of phenolics, namely as pharmacological targets involving dysfunctions of the GABA system, analyzing both their different compounds and their mechanism as GABAergic modulators. We focus this review on articles written in English since the year 2010 until the present. Of course, although more research would be necessary to fully establish the type specificity of phenolics and their pharmacological activity, the evidence supports their potential as GABA(A)R modulators, thereby favoring their inclusion in the development of new therapeutic targets based on natural products. Specifically, the data compiled in this review allows for the directing of future research towards ortho-dihydroxy diterpene galdosol, the flavonoids isoliquiritigenin (chalcone), rhusflavone and agathisflavone (biflavonoids), as well as the phlorotannins, dieckol and triphlorethol A. Clinically, flavonoids are the most interesting phenolics due to their potential as anticonvulsant and anxiolytic drugs, and phlorotannins are also of interest as sedative agents.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",F2C92f

medical,"COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th and since then more than 3 million cases and a quarter million deaths have occurred due to it. The urge to find a resultful treatment or cure is now pressing more than any other time since the outbreak of the pandemic. Researchers all over the world from different fields of expertise are trying to find the most suitable drugs, that are already known to treat other diseases, and could tackle the process of SARS-CoV2 through which it invades and replicates in human cells. Here, we discuss five of the most promising drugs that can potentially play a major role in the treatment of COVID-19. While nicotine and ivermectin may be blocking transport abilities of the virus or its components, famotidine, remdesivir and chloroquine in combination with zinc ions can deactivate important enzymes needed for the replication of the virus. While clinical trials for some of these drugs have already started, it is common knowledge that lack of organization between countries, institutes and hospitals might slow down the whole process for an official treatment based in wide, randomized, placebo controlled trials.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",VVEvxI

medical,"During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the globe have implemented a certain degree of lockdown, restricting citizens' freedom of movement and freedom of assembly. This article aims to illustrate the impact that the measures against the spread of COVID-19 have on forest recreation, building on a study in an urban context around Bonn (Germany) that was conducted between April 2019 and February 2020. The quantitative and qualitative data on urban forest visits from that study were supplemented with new census data supported by selected expert interviews. We found that visitor numbers since the inception of COVID-19 measures in March 2020 have more than doubled. Visitor patterns have drastically shifted, from an even distribution throughout the day with small peaks before and after office hours to a culmination in the late afternoon. Lastly, the interviewed forestry professionals have noted that a new set of visitors, i.e. young people, families with children and non-locals, has arrived to the forest. This influx of more and novice visitors poses challenges for forest managers and urban forest policy. It is, however, also a unique opportunity for a substantial engagement of forestry with society at large, that has implications for forest policy, especially in urban areas, possibly beyond the COVID-19 pandemic era.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",NWdBuj

medical,"Neurological disorders (NDs) are becoming more common, posing a concern to pregnant women, parents, healthy infants, and children. Neurological disorders arise in a wide variety of forms, each with its own set of origins, complications, and results. In recent years, the intricacy of brain functionalities has received a better understanding due to neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and positron emission tomography (PET), etc. With high-performance computational tools and various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, these modalities have discovered exciting possibilities for identifying and diagnosing neurological disorders. This study follows a computer-aided diagnosis methodology, leading to an overview of pre-processing and feature extraction techniques. The performance of existing ML and DL approaches for detecting NDs is critically reviewed and compared in this article. A comprehensive portion of this study also shows various modalities and disease-specified datasets that detect and records images, signals, and speeches, etc. Limited related works are also summarized on NDs, as this domain has significantly fewer works focused on disease and detection criteria. Some of the standard evaluation metrics are also presented in this study for better result analysis and comparison. This research has also been outlined in a consistent workflow. At the conclusion, a mandatory discussion section has been included to elaborate on open research challenges and directions for future work in this emerging field.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ez86eL

We overviewed the brands of aligners used in Italy and reviewed the literature on the evolution of clear aligners based on their characteristics mentioned above by consulting the main scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established. The data were collected on a purpose-made data collection form and analyzed descriptively.

medical,"Background: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events;however, its impact on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality remains unclear, especially in patients without known atheromatous disease. Aims: To evaluate the association between CAC visual score and 6-month mortality in patients without history of atheromatous disease hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A single-centre observational cohort study was conducted, involving 293 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in Paris, France, between 13 March and 30 April 2020, with a 6-month follow-up. Patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or coronary or peripheral artery disease were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 6 months according to CAC score, which was assessed by analysing images obtained after the first routine non-electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography scan performed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: A total of 251 patients (mean age 64.8 ± 16.7 years) were included in the analysis. Fifty-one patients (20.3%) died within 6 months. The mortality rate increased with the magnitude of calcifications, and was 10/101 (9.9%), 15/66 (22.7%), 10/34 (29.4%) and 16/50 (32.0%) for the no CAC, mild CAC, moderate CAC and heavy CAC groups, respectively (P = 0.004). Compared with the no calcification group, adjusted risk of death increased progressively with CAC: hazard ratio (HR) 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–5.27), HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.29–7.45) and HR 4.02 (95% CI 1.82–8.88) in the mild, moderate and heavy CAC groups, respectively. Conclusions: Non-electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography during the initial pulmonary assessment of patients with COVID-19 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed a high prevalence of mild, moderate and heavy CAC. CAC score was related to 6-month mortality, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These results highlight the importance of CAC scoring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and calls for attention to patients with high CAC.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OKZQnr

medical,"BACKGROUND Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is a widely used non-invasive method to monitor the depth of anesthesia. However, in the event of surgeries requiring a frontal approach, placement of the electrode may be impossible at the designated area to achieve a proper BIS measurement. METHODS We developed an investigational interface device to connect needle-electrodes to BIS sensors. The safety and clinical performance were investigated in patients who underwent surgery. Direct BIS values from a disposable BIS electrode and indirect values via the interface device were simultaneously recorded from the same areas of electrode placement in a single patient. The agreement between the direct and indirect BIS values was statistically analyzed. RESULTS The interface device with a silver electrode demonstrated sufficient electric conduction to transmit electroencephalogram signals. The overall BIS curves were similar to those of direct BIS monitoring. Direct and indirect BIS values from 18 patients were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model and a significant concordance was confirmed (indirect BIS = 7.0405 + 0.8286 * direct BIS, p<0.0001). Most observed data (2582/2787 data points, 92.64%) had BIS unit differences of 10 or less.

medical,"Sleep disturbances are prominent in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and predict relapse. So far, the mechanisms underlying sleep disruptions in AUD are poorly understood. Because sleep-related regions vastly overlap with regions, where patients with AUD showed pronounced grey matter (GM) reduction; we hypothesized that GM structure could contribute to sleep disturbances associated with chronic alcohol use. We combined sleep EEG recording and high-resolution structural brain imaging to examine the GM-sleep associations in 36 AUD vs. 26 healthy controls (HC). The patterns of GM-sleep associations differed for N3 vs. REM sleep and for AUD vs. HC. For cortical thickness (CT), CT-sleep associations were significant in AUD but not in HC and were lateralized such that lower CT in right hemisphere was associated with shorter N3, whereas in left hemisphere was associated with shorter REM sleep. For the GM density (GMD), we observed a more extensive positive GMD-N3 association in AUD (right orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, dorsal cingulate and occipital cortex) than in HC (right orbitofrontal cortex), and the GMD-REM association was positive in AUD (midline, motor and paralimbic regions) whereas negative in HC (the left supramarginal gyrus). GM structure mediated the effect of chronic alcohol use on the duration of N3 and the age by alcohol effect on REM sleep. Our findings provide evidence that sleep disturbances in AUD were associated with GM reductions. Targeting sleep-related regions might improve sleep in AUD and enhance sleep-induced benefits in cognition and emotional regulation for recovery.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vFUqsJ

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the cross-border movement of people. As governments begin to reopen their borders and cautiously restart travel, their attention is shifting to border procedures that could facilitate travel while protecting the homeland from travelers who may be infected. This is not the first time in recent memory that border management has had to be rethought under the pressure of large external forces. This article examines parallels between the current situation and the early 2000s, when the September 11, 2001, attacks on US targets caused a seismic shift in managing borders. We find echoes of today's responses in the initial fragmentation and chaos of two decades ago, which eventually gave way to a coordinated international system. We also analyze the implications of the emerging border health infrastructure for other migration challenges-particularly addressing irregular crossings and the border ""crises"" they create. Because the aftershocks of the pandemic on all aspects of people on the move could be felt for decades, immigration, mobility management, and public health priorities must be considered alongside one another.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_uxM4y

medical,"The purpose of this study was to explore potential mechanisms of cytotoxicity towards HeLa and HT29 cells displayed by Pediocin PA-1. We did this by carrying out sequence alignments and 3D modelling of related bacteriocins which have been studied in greater detail: Microcin E492, Eneterocin AB heterodimer and Divercin V41. Microcin E492 interacts with Toll-Like Receptor 4 in order to activate an apoptosis reaction, sequence alignment showed a high homology between Pediocin PA-1 and Microcin E492 and 3D modelling showed Pediocin PA-1 interacting with TLR-4 in a way reminiscent of Microcin E492. Furthermore, Pediocin PA-1 had the highest homology with the Enterocin heterodimer, particularly chain A; Enterocin has also shown to cause an apoptotic response in cancer cells. Based on this we are led to strongly believe Pediocin PA-1 interacts with TLRs in order to cause cell death. If this is the case it would explain the difference in cytotoxicity towards HeLa over HT29 cells, due to difference in expression of particular TLRs. Overall, we believe Pediocin PA-1 exhibits a dual effect which is dose dependant, like that of Microcin. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that we were unable to carry out experiments in the lab, and the unavailability of important data meant we were unable to make solid conclusions but rather suggestions.

medical,"Despite the measures taken worldwide, COVID-19 pandemic still progresses. While efficient antiviral drugs are not yet widely available, vaccination is the best option to control the infection rate. Although this option is obvious in case of COVID-19-naive individuals, it is still unclear when individuals who have recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should be vaccinated and whether the vaccination raises immune responses against the coronavirus and its novel variants. Here we measured the dynamics of the antibody and T-cell responses, as well as virus neutralizing activity (VNA) in serum against two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.1 and B.1.617.2, among 84 individuals with different COVID-19 status who were vaccinated with Sputnik Light vaccine. We showed that vaccination of individuals previously exposed to the virus considerably boosts the existing immune response. In these individuals, RBD-specific IgG titers and VNA in serum were already elevated on the 7th day after vaccination, while COVID-19-naive individuals developed the antibody response and VNA mainly 21 days post-vaccination. Additionally, we found a strong correlation between RBD-specific IgG titers and VNA in serum, and according to these data vaccination may be recommended if the RBD-specific IgG titers drop to 142.7 BAU/mL or below. In summary, the results of the study demonstrate that vaccination is beneficial both for COVID-19-naive and recovered individuals, especially since it raises serum VNA against the B.1.617.2 variant - one of four the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pG6H-Y

medical,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the relationship between the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the early clinical outcomes in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective observational study involving 190 children from January 2013 to August 2019 was conducted. Perioperative clinical and biochemical data were collected. RESULTS: We found that pre-operative NLR was significantly correlated with AST, STB, CR and UA (P < 0.05), while post-operative NLR was significantly correlated with ALT, AST, BUN (P < 0.05). Increased post-operative neutrophil count and NLR as well as decreased lymphocyte count could be observed after cardiac surgery (P < 0.05). Level of pre-operative NLR was significantly correlated with mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time and total length of stay (P < 0.05), while level of post-operative NLR was only significantly correlated to the first two (P < 0.05). By using ROC curve analysis, relevant areas under the curve for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation time beyond 24 h, 48 h and 72 h by NLR were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with CHD-PAH, NLR was closely related to early post-operative complications and clinical outcomes, and could act as a novel marker to predict the occurrence of prolonged mechanical ventilation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XNx9-4

Spiritual care is less prioritised and, consequently, this service, if offered, is mostly entrusted to volunteers. It therefore becomes prudent to understand who these volunteers are, what motivates them to volunteer, and how they see spiritual care being sustainable in the future. A cohort of spiritual care workers from a prominent hospice in Cape Town, South Africa, participated in this qualitative study.

medical,"In the current socio-health situation, new educational challenges have emerged, such as the need to implement a virtual tutorial action. Therefore, this study has three objectives: (1) to investigate the level of digital competence that early childhood and primary school teachers possess to carry out quality online tutorial actions; (2) to analyse whether there are differences in use at both education stages; and (3) to identify which variables significantly affect the development of this competence at each educational stage. For this purpose, an ex post facto design was used, based on the survey technique, by means of non-probabilistic purposive sampling. The final sample consisted of a total of 1,069 educators working at the early childhood and primary education stages, from all over Spain. The results showed acceptable digital competence, with higher scores in the primary education stage, which may be due to characteristics of the students and the education stage itself, rather than to teachers’ digital competences. On the other hand, it was found that the virtual tutorial action tasks are significantly influenced in the early childhood education stage by blogs, WhatsApp, Facebook, and number of tutoring hours per month with families, while for the primary stage they are influenced by blogs, WhatsApp, Twitter, ClassDojo, Moodle, tutoring hours, number of tutoring hours per month with families, and sex. Based on these results, there is an obvious need for educational institutions to continue to develop teacher training in relation to the use of resources to carry out adequate tutoring actions and thus increase the diversification in the use of resources.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vYlfmn
medical,"The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on the 11thof March 2020. Since then, many efforts are being carried out to contain the virus. Knowledge and attitude of people should be directed towards strict preventive practices in order to halt the spread of the virus. The aim of the current cross-sectional study is to assess the knowledge, practice and attitude of university students from medical and non-medical colleges in Jordan using a structured questionnaire involving a total number of 592 students. A positive response regarding the overall knowledge about the symptoms of COVID-19 was observed in more than 90% of the students. In response to the attitude and practice, a good number of students nearly 99.7% agreed that hand washing is necessary for prevention of infection whereas 68.4% believed that mask wearing would prevent the infection. Around 6-7% students considered the virus as a stigma hence would not visit hospital. Also, around 10% students believed that their religious beliefs and body immunity might protect them from infection. More dangerously, 20.6% and 19.2% students believed antibiotics and smoking to be a protective measure against the infection respectively. Also, 96.8% do avoid hand shaking, 98.8% wash their hands and 93.3% use alcoholic rub, 95.8% cough or sneeze in a tissue and dispose it in waste bin, 51% will drink ginger with honey and 42.7% eat garlic for infection prevention. The main sources of knowledge were social media, internet and television. No significant difference was noticed between medical and non medical colleges. Thus, there is a need for more detailed and directed measures and awareness campaigns to improve the knowledge, attitude and practice in some critical aspects to contain the virus.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7USbik

The main exception is remdesivir, for which several trials have been published supporting its use for patients with severe COVID-19. No solid organ transplant-specific data on remdesivir or other antiviral therapies have been published so far.

medical,"Background As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases Methods In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan Results We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact Conclusions To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_tWJUU

medical," Felodipine Why is this medication prescribed? Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure. Felodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so your heart does not have to pump as hard. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in governments implementing disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children's development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GXRJFd

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in 2019 and is still an on-going pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 uses a human protease called furin to aid in cellular entry and its main protease (M(pro)) to achieve viral replication. By targeting these proteins, scientists are trying to identify phytoconstituents of medicinal plants as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Therefore, our study was aimed to identify promising leads as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin using the phytocompounds reported to be isolated from Acacia pennata (L.) Willd. RESULTS: A total of 29 phytocompounds were reported to be isolated from A. pennata. Molecular docking simulation studies revealed 9 phytocompounds as having the top 5 binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. Among these phytocompounds, quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (C_18), kaempferol 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (C_4), and isovitexin (C_5) have the highest drug score. However, C_18 and C_4 were not selected for further studies due to bioavailability issues and low synthetic accessibility. Based on binding affinity, molecular properties, drug-likeness, toxicity parameters, ligand interactions, bioavailability, synthetic accessibility, structure–activity relationship, and comparative analysis of our experimental findings with other studies, C_5 was identified as the most promising phytocompound. C_5 interacted with the active site residues of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (GLU166, ARG188, GLN189) and furin (ASN295, ARG298, HIS364, THR365). Many phytocompounds that interacted with these amino acid residues were reported by other studies as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. The oxygen atom at position 18, the –OH group at position 19, and the 6-C-glucoside were identified as the pharmacophores in isovitexin (also known as apigenin-6-C-glucoside). Other in-silico studies reported apigenin as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was reported to show stable conformation during MD simulations with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). CONCLUSION: The present study found isovitexin as the most promising phytocompound to potentially inhibit the cellular entry and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. We also conclude that compounds having oxygen atom at position 18 (C-ring), –OH group at position 19 (A-ring), and 6-C-glucoside attached to the A-ring at position 3 on a C(6)–C(3)–C(6) flavonoid scaffold could offer the best alternative to develop new leads against SARS-CoV-2.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Riq-4e

The results showed that the best mechanical properties in terms of biomedical application were achieved for the MWCNTs coating with titania outer layer. Nevertheless, both the addition of nanocopper and titania improved the mechanical resistance of the base MWCNTs coating.

medical,"The purpose of this study is to review the published literature for the range of radiographic findings present in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 infection. This novel corona virus is currently the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Pulmonary symptoms and signs dominate the clinical picture and radiologists are called upon to evaluate chest radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) images to assess for infiltrates and to define their extent, distribution and progression. Multiple studies attempt to characterize the disease course by looking at the timing of imaging relative to the onset of symptoms. In general, plain CXR show bilateral disease with a tendency toward the lung periphery and have an appearance most consistent with viral pneumonia. Chest CT images are most notable for showing bilateral and peripheral ground glass and consolidated opacities and are marked by an absence of concomitant pulmonary nodules, cavitation, adenopathy and pleural effusions. Published literature mentioning organ systems aside from pulmonary manifestations are relatively less common, yet present and are addressed in this review. Similarly, publications focusing on imaging modalities aside from CXR and chest CT are sparse in this evolving crisis and are likewise addressed in this review. The role of imaging is examined as it is currently being debated in the medical community, which is not at all surprising considering the highly infectious nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6-mVcO

RESULTS There was a significant difference between both groups in the mean number of days until drain removal (6.4 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.8 days; P value = 0.033), and the mean total volume of drainage fluid (365.3 ± 242.2 vs. 625.1 ± 446.6 mL; P value = 0.009). The incidence of seroma was similar in both groups (43.3 vs. 37.9 %; P value = 0.673). There was no statistically significant difference in axillary dissection operating time (66 vs. 70 min; P value = 0.371), or the mean volume of blood loss (18.2 ± 31.1 vs. 20.6 ± 26.3 mL; P value = 0.663). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that BVSS is a more effective device when compared to the conventional techniques in axillary dissection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",agS7aq

medical,"Pandemic with mutation and permanent immune spreading in a small-world network described is studied by a modified SIR model, with consideration of mutation-immune mechanism. First, a novel mutation-immune model is proposed to modify the classical SIR model to simulate the transmission of mutable viruses that can be permanently immunized in small-world networks. Then, the influences of the size, coordination number and disorder parameter of the small-world network on the spread of the epidemic are analyzed in detail. Finally, the influences of mutation cycle and infection rate on epidemic transmission in small-world network are investigated further. The results show that the structure of the small-world network and the virus mutation cycle have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic. For viruses that can be permanently immunized, virus mutation is equivalent to making the immune cycle of human beings from infinite to finite. The dynamical behavior of the modified SIR epidemic model changes from an irregular, low-amplitude evolution at small disorder parameter to a spontaneous state of wide amplitude oscillations at large disorder parameter. Moreover, similar transition can also be found in increasing mutation cycle parameter. The maximum valid variation mutation decreases with the increase of disorder parameter and coordination number, but increase with respect to system size. In addition above, as the infection rate increases, the fraction of the infected increases and then decreases. As the mutation cycle increases, the time-average fraction of the infected and the infection rate corresponding to the maximum time-average fraction of the infected also decrease. As one conclusion, the results could give a deep understanding Pandemic with mutation and permanent immune spreading, from viewpoint of small-world network.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uXWcxV

medical,"RATIONALE: It is estimated that between four and 8 million people worldwide suffer from respiratory infections caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). Each year over 300,000 of those cases are due to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with suppressed immune systems. Recent increases in the number and severity of cases of both influenza and COVID19-infected patients acquiring aspergillosis suggests that viral infection can create transiently suppressed immune environments permissive to fungal infection. This is likely because the outcome of IPA is directly related to the severity of lung tissue damage. We recently discovered that differential type I interferon (IFN) signaling, via the IFNAR2 subunit of the IFNAR1/2 heterodimeric receptor, regulates damage responses during pulmonary infection, allowing for an environment permissive to fungal infection. Thus, understanding how IFNAR2 regulates the damage response during pulmonary Af infection will allow us to understand the role of type I IFN signaling in anti-fungal immunity and controlling pulmonary tissue damage. METHODS: Utilizing a murine pulmonary infection model, we identified distinct roles for IFNAR2 and IFNAR1 in regulating both damage and clearance during Af infection. We determined the components and extent of the damage response utilizing proteomic, histological, and molecular approaches. RESULTS: We found that absence of the IFNAR2 subunit (Ifnar2-/-mice) resulted in increased damage biomarkers in the lungs (from both myeloid and epithelial/endothelial compartments), increased morbidity, and increased inflammation in response to Af infection, while absence of IFNAR1 (Ifnar1-/-mice) did not. Additionally, we found that presence of IFNAR2 in either WT or Ifnar1-/-mice correlated with early decreased Af conidia clearance compared to Ifnar2-/-mice, and our results suggest that this requires cell-cell interactions/signaling between pulmonary epithelial and myeloid cells. Importantly, however, we found that as Af infection progressed that Ifnar2-/-mice were not able to prevent invasive hyphal growth, and they experienced increased host epithelial and endothelial damage responses, suggesting that the unregulated damage response in the Ifnar2-/-mice may create a conducive environment for invasive Af disease. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results begin to establish a role for IFNAR2 in regulation of the host damage response to Af and suggests that aberrant type I IFN signaling may contribute to a permissive environment allowing for Af infection to occur. Understanding the mechanisms involved in IFNAR regulation of damage and anti-fungal immunity could inform design of better treatments aimed at minimizing damage in patients with IPA.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8zqEO9

medical,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate chest-computed-tomography (CT) scans in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients for signs of organizing pneumonia (OP) and microinfarction as surrogate for microscopic thromboembolic events. METHODS: Real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patients undergoing chest-CT (non-enhanced, enhanced, pulmonary-angiography [CT-PA]) from March-April 2020 were retrospectively included (COVID-19-cohort). As control-groups served 175 patients from 2020 (cohort-2020) and 157 patients from 2019 (cohort-2019) undergoing CT-PA for pulmonary embolism (PE) during the respective time frame at our institution. Two independent readers assessed for presence and location of PE in all three cohorts. In COVID-19 patients additionally parenchymal changes typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, infarct pneumonia and OP were assessed. Inter-reader agreement and prevalence of PE in different cohorts were calculated. RESULTS: From 68 COVID-19 patients (42 female [61.8%], median age 59 years [range 32–89]) undergoing chest-CT 38 obtained CT-PA. Inter-reader-agreement was good (k = 0.781). On CT-PA, 13.2% of COVID-19 patients presented with PE whereas in the control-groups prevalence of PE was 9.1% and 8.9%, respectively (p = 0.452). Up to 50% of COVID-19 patients showed changes typical for OP. 21.1% of COVID-19 patients suspected with PE showed subpleural wedge-shaped consolidation resembling infarct pneumonia, while only 13.2% showed visible filling defects of the pulmonary artery branches on CT-PA. CONCLUSION: Despite the reported hypercoagulability in critically ill patients with COVID-19, we did not encounter higher prevalence of PE in our patient cohort compared to the control cohorts. However, patients with suspected PE showed a higher prevalence of lung changes, resembling patterns of infarct pneumonia or OP and CT-signs of pulmonary-artery hypertension.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nji6gt

medical,"At a time of transition into adulthood, tertiary study places additional stresses on the mental wellbeing of students. The continual assessment, long teaching hours, and expectation of professionalism that is expected from students within clinical programmes places even more burden on these students. Then in 2020, with the COVID-19 lockdown, there were significant changes to how these programs were delivered. We surveyed the mental wellbeing of our undergraduate students in the Bachelor of Optometry and Bachelor of Pharmacy programmes at the University of Auckland in 2019 and 2020. Using validated screening questionnaires, we found a high level of anxiety and depression in both years, however, in 2020 following the lockdown, anxiety levels in our students decreased. We found that the leading stressor was academic stress, and levels of anxiety were inversely correlated with perceived academic success. Therefore, we believe the lockdown, which provided both a break from clinical stresses and a change in teaching modality to online delivery, provided a period of relief, despite the potential stressful environment regarding COVID-19. To help alleviate the high level of distress in our students, lessons could be learned to decrease the stress levels in our students by continuing with alternative teaching and assessment styles. Practitioner Notes 1. A substantial proportion of tertiary clinical students face experience anxiety and depression 2. Most of the stress derives from academic pressures 3. During the COVID-19 lockdown, with enforced changes to teaching and evaluation, students experienced a significant reduction in anxiety 4.

medical,"I m not sure if you can help me or not. I ve had lower abdominal pains which have worsened over the past three months. I was in hospital six months ago with an infection which was diagnosed as a sizeable cyst of 4inches on my left ovary but nothing was done and I wasn t given a follow up appointment. Since then, a similar pain has developed but worse on my right side which some days leaves me doubled over and a pain in my lower back started about a month ago. The pain in my left side is more of a dull ache which never goes away but the pain in my right sometimes is a sharp, burning pain. Some days it feels like extreme period pains but I never used to suffer during that time and now I m sometimes bedridden for a couple of days. I m not sure if its linked. I finally plucked up the courage three weeks ago to go and see a doctor who took blood tests. I d been told to go back this morning for my results. Unfortunately, the original lady doctor I d seen has since left the surgery and my appointment this morning was with a male doctor. He told me my levels of CA125 were 67 and although slightly elevated, it was nothing to worry about. He has arranged for a pelvic ultrasound in three weeks. However, he has ruled it out as anything to do with my ovaries and is suggesting that because of the pain in my back, it could be something called Scoliosis . He has also referred me to a musculoskeletal Clinic for an assesment. I ve never had any problems with my back previously. I can t see how this can explain the severe pains I m having and why this wasn t explored further when I was in hospital. I also can t find anything on the internet about what the level of CA125 should be? Should I get a second opinion or just wait for three weeks till my ultrasound? I d refrained from getting worried or reading anything on the internet till just now because what the doctor said, doesn t make sense. Now I m concerned that some of the symptoms of ovarian cancer are symptoms I ve had over the past couple of months. I m 31 yrs old and have never had children. I am asthmatic though and my recent cervical smear came back clear as did the other blood tests they did for thyroids etc. I m sure though that after I d told the doctor how I was feeling he would ve mentioned it as a possibility but he didn t mention it at all.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020. States issued stay-at-home orders and hospitals cancelled non-emergent surgeries. During this time, we anecdotally noticed more admissions for perforated appendicitis. Therefore, we hypothesized that during the months following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, more children were presenting with perforated appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study reviewing pediatric patients admitted at a single institution with acute and/or perforated appendicitis between October 2019 to May 2020. Interval appendectomies were excluded. COVID-19 months were designated as March, April, and May 2020. Additional analysis of March, April, and May 2019 was performed for comparison purposes. Analyzed data included demographics, symptoms, white blood cell count, imaging findings, procedures performed, and perforation status. Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: During the study period, 285 patients were admitted with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with 95 patients being perforated. We identified a significant increase in perforated appendicitis cases in the three COVID-19 months compared with the preceding five months (45.6% vs 26.4%; p <0.001). In addition, a similar significant increase was identified when comparing to the same months a year prior (p = 0.003). No significant difference in duration of pain was identified (p=0.926). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stay-at-home orders have had downstream effects on healthcare. Our review has demonstrated a significant increase in the number of children presenting with perforated appendicitis following these stay-at-home ordinances. These results demonstrate that further investigations into the issues surrounding access to healthcare, especially during this pandemic, are warranted.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_fYG4c

medical,"Injections of insulin are the main treatment for diabetes, but in the long run this therapy can induce serious drawbacks. This has inspired new drugs able to decrease insulin requirements. For instance, human amylin (hIAPP) is a small hormone cosecreted by pancreatic β-cells with insulin to which is a synergistic partner. However, the high amyloidogenicity of hIAPP precluded it as a therapeutics and led to the design of pramlintide (sIAPP), a chimeric analogue with substitutions (A25P, S28P, and S29P) inherited from the aggregation-resistant rat isoform (rIAPP). Despite sIAPP advantages, it still shares with hIAPP a poorly soluble profile at physiological pH that hampers its mixture with insulin. Recent improvements, as charge-enhanced mutants, have been proposed. For instance, sIAPP+ was screened in silico by purely microcanonical thermostatistical methods and adds to sIAPP an S20R mutation to uplift its solubility. This suggests that such physically inspired computational approach may also be auspicious on devising effective coformulations of insulin with amylin analogues. In this seminal attempt, we make comparative multicanonical simulations of regular acting human insulin coformulated with hIAPP, sIAPP, or sIAPP+. To assess the respective physicochemical stabilities against aggregation, we characterize the structural-phase transitions through the microcanonical thermodynamic formalism and evaluate their time lags using the classical nucleation theory. These results are then correlated with estimates of solvation free energies, modeled by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and structural propensities. Experimental essays are compared to our simulations and support our methodology.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Sj7S05

medical,"INTRODUCTION Microstructural alterations as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are key findings in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and small vessel disease (SVD). We determined the contribution of each of these conditions to diffusion alterations. METHODS We studied six samples (N = 365 participants) covering the spectrum of AD and SVD, including genetically defined samples. We calculated diffusion measures from DTI and free water imaging. Simple linear, multivariable random forest, and voxel-based regressions were used to evaluate associations between AD biomarkers (amyloid beta, tau), SVD imaging markers, and diffusion measures. RESULTS SVD markers were strongly associated with diffusion measures and showed a higher contribution than AD biomarkers in multivariable analysis across all memory clinic samples. Voxel-wise analyses between tau and diffusion measures were not significant. DISCUSSION In memory clinic patients, the effect of SVD on diffusion alterations largely exceeds the effect of AD, supporting the value of diffusion measures as markers of SVD.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7BNZ8U

medical,"BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illnesses (ILI), a subset of acute respiratory infections (ARI), are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. ILI can be caused by numerous pathogens, however; there is limited information on the etiology and epidemiology of ILI in China. METHODS: We performed a one-year surveillance study (2010) of viral etiology causing ILI and investigated the influence of climate on outbreaks of ILI attributed to viruses at the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in Zhuhai, China. RESULTS: Of the 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42). Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV). Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns. The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature. Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens are circulating in Zhuhai city. This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",IULAoQ

medical,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted from novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide concern. It is imperative to develop rapid, sensitive, and specific biosensing methods. Herein, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12a powered visual biosensor with a smartphone readout for ultrasensitive and selective detection of SARS-CoV-2. Simply, the SARS-CoV-2 derived nucleic acids triggered CRISPR-Cas12a based indiscriminate degradation of a single-stranded DNA that was supposed to link two gold nanoparticles, inducing the dis-aggregation of gold nanoparticles and thus generating observable color changes. This change can be readily distinguished by naked eyes as well as a smartphone with a Color Picker App. The proposed biosensor was successfully applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 gene in synthetic vectors, transcribed RNA and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. It rendered “single copy resolution” as evidenced by the 1 copy/μL limit of detection of pseudoviruses with no cross-reactivity. When the developed biosensor was challenged with SARS-CoV-2 clinical bio-samples, it provided 100% agreement (both positive and negative) with qPCR results. The sample-to-result time was roughly 90 min.

SARS-CoV2 infection was detected in 33 subjects, with a 3-months cumulative incidence of 0.90% and 0.42% in SARS-CoV-2-naive and experienced subjects, respectively. Vaccine protection was 87% in naive and 94% in experienced subjects when compared with a pre-vaccination control group. The infection was mildly symptomatic in 16 (48%) and asymptomatic in 17 (52%) subjects. Virus isolation was positive in 7/13 (54%) symptomatic and 4/8 (50%) asymptomatic subjects tested, and B.1.1.7 lineage was detected in all subjects.

medical,"Due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease - 19), most schools have adopted remote or mixed methods to teach;therefore, students need new types of educational products to achieve a high-quality learning experience. There are many difficulties and obstacles to taking classes online. More interactions and formats need to be explored for students to absorb as much classroom knowledge as possible. The research team conducted a design workshop. Thirty-eight psychology and applied psychology students participated in this workshop using different user research methods, such as user journey maps and how-to methods. They explored educational products in five scenarios: taking physical education classes, giving online learning feedback, conducting teamwork, taking an online examination, and studying in the dormitory. Each group proposed design solutions to solve design problems in a particular context. For the 56 design problems, the participants identified 548 design solutions. The facilitator helped the group select six or seven design challenges with higher priorities. All the research data were collected, and the jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) theory was used to analyze users’ needs for future educational products. The users’ needs were summarized into user need clusters. This study has identified seven primary user needs and 20 sub-needs in five scenarios. The insights gained from this study may be of assistance to UX designers and UX researchers to obtain a new perspective on scenarios. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",O2KlEH

medical,"BACKGROUND Diabetes is a multisystem disorder associated with a nearly twofold excess risk for a broad range of adverse cardiovascular outcomes including coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Liraglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide receptor analog approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). STUDY DESIGN To formally assess the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide, the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results (LEADER) trial was commenced in 2010. LEADER is a phase 3B, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with long-term follow-up. Patients with T2DM at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were either drug naive or treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents or selected insulin regimens (human NPH, long-acting analog, or premixed) alone or in combination with oral antihyperglycemics were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients are being followed for up to 5 years. The primary end point is the time from randomization to a composite outcome consisting of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. CONCLUSIONS LEADER commenced in September 2010, and enrollment concluded in April 2012. There were 9,340 patients enrolled at 410 sites in 32 countries. The mean age of patients was 64.3 ± 7.2 years, 64.3% were men, and mean body mass index was 32.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2. There were 7,592 (81.3%) patients with prior CVD and 1,748 (18.7%) who were high risk but without prior CVD. It is expected that LEADER will provide conclusive data regarding the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide relative to the current standard of usual care for a global population of patients with T2DM.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xiQBPo

medical,"BACKGROUND Addressing operational inefficiencies in operating rooms (ORs) enhances patient access to care, reduces delays, and improves employee and patient satisfaction. The Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) promotes patient safety through increased teamwork, empowerment of frontline staff, and utilization of science of safety principles. CUSP has demonstrated success in outpatient and inpatient settings to decrease complication rates and establish a culture of safety but has been used minimally in the perioperative setting. In this study, the CUSP methodology was utilized to improve perioperative efficiency in pediatric spine surgery, and preimplementation and postimplementation efficiency were compared, using the rate of first case on-time starts (FCOTS) as the primary metric. METHODS A CUSP quality improvement workgroup including nurses, technicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and administrators sought feedback on opportunities for improvement and tracked key performance metrics in the OR from 2015 to 2020. Key interventions developed in response to feedback included standardizing and streamlining room setup and adjusting staffing models for greater efficiency. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare time periods pre-CUSP and post-CUSP implementation. RESULTS First case on-time starts increased from 38% to a high of 81% after implementation. For more complex cases, the average patient in the room to anesthesia ready time improved by 31% with decreased variance over time, and average closure to patient out of room time improved by 45%. Improvements were sustained through Year 3, while CUSP remained a primary focus for the team. CONCLUSIONS CUSP is effective in enhancing perioperative efficiency, demonstrating strong improvement in on-time starts over 5 years. The results indicate that process improvement in ORs requires consistent attention to sustain gains over time. Engaging frontline staff in quality improvement fosters collaboration and provides employee buy-in to promoting a culture of safety and improving value in patient care.

However, with the changing circumstances (e.g. the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic), new influencing factors might evolve and can influence the attitudes of consumers towards using eHealth applications. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate the evolving factors affecting consumer attitudes towards the use of eHealth applications and provide implications for the future of Neom. METHODS: An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 976 eHealth consumers in Saudi Arabia, which included 527 male and 449 female participants. Findings were analysed using the statistical means and standard deviations for each item in the questionnaire to analyse the role of each factor in depth. Statistical t-tests were used to identify significant differences between the groups categorised by age and gender. RESULTS: ‘Necessity but not interest’ (mean 4.5 [standard deviation {SD} 1.12]) and fear (mean 4.5 [SD 1.13]) and psychological factors including depression (mean 4.4 [SD 1.54]), stress (mean 4.2 [SD 1.09]) and anxiety (mean 4.3 [SD 1.61]) were identified to be major evolving influencing factors, while other factors including performance expectancy, ease of use, enjoyment and incentives were identified to be comparatively less influential.

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases.

medical,"IMPORTANCE: Low testosterone levels in males have been linked with increase in proinflammatory cytokines-a primary culprit in COVID-19 disease progression-and with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. To date, however, no published studies have assessed the effect of testosterone therapy on COVID-19 outcomes in older men. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether testosterone therapy reduced disease progression in older men diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nested within a national cohort of older (aged ≥50 years) male patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021 from the Optum electronic health record COVID-19 database, two matched case-control studies of COVID-19 outcomes were conducted. Cases-defined, respectively, as persons who (a) were hospitalized ≤30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (n = 33,380), and (b) were admitted to the intensive care unit or received mechanical ventilation during their COVID-19 hospitalization (n = 10,273)-were matched 1:1 with controls based on demographic and clinical factors. EXPOSURES: Testosterone therapy was defined based on receipt of prescription at ≤60, ≤90, or ≤120 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation during COVID-19 hospitalization. RESULTS: The use of testosterone therapy was not associated with decreased odds of hospitalization (≤60 days: OR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-1.20; ≤90 days: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.68-1.13; ≤120 days: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.72-1.32) or intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation (≤60 days: OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.37-1.23; ≤90 days: OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.36-0.11; ≤120 days: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.29-1.19).

medical,"Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are the leading causes of death and disabilities in the world. It is quite challenging to treat CNS diseases efficiently because of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). It is a physical barrier with tight junction proteins and high selectivity to limit the substance transportation between the blood and neural tissues. Thus, it is important to understand BBB transport mechanisms for developing novel drug carriers to overcome the BBB. This paper introduces the structure of the BBB and its physiological transport mechanisms. Meanwhile, different strategies for crossing the BBB by using nanomaterial-based drug carriers are reviewed, including carrier-mediated, adsorptive-mediated, and receptor-mediated transcytosis. Since the viral-induced CNS diseases are associated with BBB breakdown, various neurotropic viruses and their mechanisms on BBB disruption are reviewed and discussed, which are considered as an alternative solution to overcome the BBB. Therefore, most recent studies on virus-mimicking nanocarriers for drug delivery to cross the BBB are also reviewed and discussed. On the other hand, the routes of administration of drug-loaded nanocarriers to the CNS have been reviewed. In sum, this paper reviews and discusses various strategies and routes of nano-formulated drug delivery systems across the BBB to the brain, which will contribute to the advanced diagnosis and treatment of CNS diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",eGDAVV

Vaccinations against these pathogens are effective in older adults. Frailty seems to be an important determinant of vaccination rates, yet data supporting this association are still missing. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of four recommended vaccinations (influenza, herpes zoster, pneumococcal and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and the association with multidimensional frailty assessed using a self-reported comprehensive geriatric assessment tool, i.e., the multidimensional prognostic index (SELFY-MPI). Older participants visiting the outpatient clinic of Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, Palermo, Italy were included. The SELFY-MPI questionnaire score was calculated based on eight different domains, while the vaccination status was determined using self-reported information. We included 319 participants from the 500 initially considered (63.8%). Vaccination against influenza was observed in 70.5% of the cases, whilst only 1.3% received the vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis. Participants with higher SELFY-MPI scores were more likely to report vaccination against pneumococcus (45.6 vs. 28.3%, p = 0.01), whilst no significant differences were observed for the other vaccinations. In conclusion, the coverage of recommended vaccinations is low. Higher SELFY-MPI scores and vaccination status, particularly anti-pneumococcus, appear to be associated, but future studies are urgently needed for confirming that frailty is associated with vaccination status in older people.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PLWi7m
medical,"BACKGROUND: The FIDELIO-DKD trial (Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) evaluated the effect of the nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with optimized renin–angiotensin system blockade. Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the composite kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. We report the effect of finerenone on individual cardiovascular outcomes and in patients with and without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 to 5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 to <75 mL per min per 1.73 m(2), treated with optimized renin–angiotensin system blockade. Patients with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive finerenone or placebo. The composite cardiovascular outcome included time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. Prespecified cardiovascular analyses included analyses of the components of this composite and outcomes according to CVD history at baseline. RESULTS: Between September 2015 and June 2018, 13 911 patients were screened and 5674 were randomized; 45.9% of patients had CVD at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years (interquartile range, 2.0–3.4 years), finerenone reduced the risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75–0.99]; P=0.034), with no significant interaction between patients with and without CVD (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71–1.01] in patients with a history of CVD; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.68–1.08] in patients without a history of CVD; P value for interaction, 0.85). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between treatment arms, with a low incidence of hyperkalemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation (2.3% with finerenone versus 0.8% with placebo in patients with CVD and 2.2% with finerenone versus 1.0% with placebo in patients without CVD). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, finerenone reduced incidence of the composite cardiovascular outcome, with no evidence of differences in treatment effect based on preexisting CVD status.

medical,"Influenza affects millions of people worldwide and can result in severe sickness and even death. The best method of prevention is vaccination; however, the seasonal influenza vaccine often suffers from low efficacy and requires yearly vaccination due to changes in strain and viral mutations. More conserved universal influenza antigens like M2 ectodomain (M2e) and the stalk region of hemagglutinin (HA stalk) have been used clinically but often suffer from low antigenicity. To increase antigenicity, universal antigens have been formulated using nano/microparticles as vaccine carriers against influenza. Utilizing polymers, liposomes, metal, and protein-based particles, indicators of immunity and protection in mouse, pig, ferrets, and chicken models of influenza have been shown. In this review, seasonal and universal influenza vaccine formulations comprised of these materials including their physiochemical properties, fabrication, characterization, and biologic responses in vivo are highlighted. The review is concluded with future perspectives for nano/microparticles as carrier systems and other considerations within the universal influenza vaccine delivery landscape.

medical,"Introduction: Asthma and allergy occur frequently among seafood processing workers, with the highest prevalence seen in the crustacean processing industry. In this study we established for the first time the prevalence of allergic sensitization in the Norwegian king- and edible crab processing industry and characterized the IgE-reactive proteins. Materials and Methods: Two populations of crab processing workers participated; 119 king crab and 65 edible crab workers. The investigation included information on work tasks and health through a detailed questionnaire. Allergic sensitization was investigated by crab-specific IgE quantification and skin prick tests (SPT) to four in-house prepared crab extracts; raw meat, cooked meat, raw intestines and raw shell. Allergen-specific IgE binding patterns were analyzed by IgE immunoblotting to the four allergen extracts using worker serum samples. Total proteins in crab SPT extracts and immunoblot-based IgE binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Results: Positive SPTs were established in 17.5% of king- and 18.1% of edible crab workers, while elevated IgE to crab were demonstrated in 8.9% of king- and 12.2% of edible crab processing workers. There was no significant difference between the king and edible crab workers with respect to self-reported respiratory symptoms, elevated specific IgE to crab or SPT results. Individual workers exhibited differential IgE binding patterns to different crab extracts, with most frequent binding to tropomyosin and arginine kinase and two novel IgE binding proteins, hemocyanin and enolase, identified as king- and edible crab allergens. Conclusions: Occupational exposure to king- and edible crabs may frequently cause IgE mediated allergic sensitization. Future investigations addressing the diagnostic value of crab allergens including tropomyosin and arginine kinase and the less well-known IgE-binding proteins hemocyanin and enolase in a component-resolved diagnostic approach to crab allergy should be encouraged.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",qeK0NY

medical,"The transport of oxygen between blood and tissue is limited by blood's capillary transit time, understood as the time available for diffusion exchange before blood returns to the heart. If all capillaries contribute equally to tissue oxygenation at all times, this physical limitation would render vasodilation and increased blood flow insufficient means to meet increased metabolic demands in the heart, muscle, and other organs. In 1920, Danish physiologist August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his mathematical and quantitative, experimental demonstration of a solution to this conceptual problem: capillary recruitment, the active opening of previously closed capillaries to meet metabolic demands. Today, capillary recruitment is still mentioned in textbooks. When we suspect symptoms might represent hypoxia of a vascular origin, however, we search for relevant, flow-limiting conditions in our patients and rarely ascribe hypoxia or hypoxemia to short capillary transit times. This review describes how natural changes in capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) and capillary hematocrit (HCT) across open capillaries during blood flow increases can account for a match of oxygen availability to metabolic demands in normal tissue. CTH and HCT depend on a number of factors: on blood properties, including plasma viscosity, the number, size, and deformability of blood cells, and blood cell interactions with capillary endothelium; on anatomical factors including glycocalyx, endothelial cells, basement membrane, and pericytes that affect the capillary diameter; and on any external compression. The review describes how risk factor- and disease-related changes in CTH and HCT interfere with flow-metabolism coupling and tissue oxygenation and discusses whether such capillary dysfunction contributes to vascular disease pathology.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0gxnuw
medical,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may result in a life-threatening condition due to a hyperactive immune reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection, for which no effective treatment is available. Based on the potent immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a growing number of trials are ongoing. This prompted us to carry out a thorough immunological study in a patient treated with umbilical cord-derived MSCs and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for COVID-19-related pneumonia. The exploratory analyses were assessed on both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid lavage samples at baseline and after cellular infusion by means of single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, ELISA, and functional assays. Remarkably, a normalization of circulating T lymphocytes count paralleled by a reduction of inflammatory myeloid cells, and a decrease in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mostly of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, were observed. In addition, a drop of plasma levels of those chemokines essential for neutrophil recruitment became evident that paralleled the decrease of lung-infiltrating inflammatory neutrophils. Finally, circulating monocytes and low-density gradient neutrophils acquired immunosuppressive function. This scenario was accompanied by an amelioration of respiratory, renal, inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic indexes. Our results provide the first immunological data possibly related to the use of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in severe COVID-19 context.

medical,"• Proposing a coevolution model for resource allocation and epidemic spreading on metapopulation network. • Develop a mathematical framework to analyze the dynamical system and obtain the epidemic threshold concerning external factors. • The disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased. • There exists an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations. A practical resource allocation strategy is the prerequisite for disease control during a pandemic affected by various external factors, such as the information about the epidemic state, the interregional population mobility, and the geographical factors. Understanding the influence of these factors on resource allocation and epidemic spreading is the premise for designing an optimal resource allocation strategy. To this end, we study the interaction of resource allocation and epidemic spreading in the scope of the metapopulation model by incorporating the factors of geographic proximity, the information of the epidemic state, the willingness of resource allocation, and the population mobility simultaneously. We develop a mathematical framework based on the Markovian chain approach to analyze the dynamical system and obtain the epidemic threshold concerning external factors. Combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased in terms of the geographical factor during a pandemic. Specifically, the spreading size is the lowest, and the epidemic threshold is the largest when resources are allocated unbiasedly between neighbor nodes and other nodes. In addition, when studying the effects of resource allocation on the epidemic threshold, we find the same results, i.e., information-aware resource allocation with unbiased in terms of the geographical factor will raise the epidemic threshold. At last, we study the effects of mobility rate on the dynamical property and find an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations. Our findings will have a direct application in the development of strategies to suppress the spread of the disease and guide the behavior of individuals during a pandemic.

medical,"Yearly in Mauritius, only a few Special Educational Needs (SEN) and especially Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students manage to get a passing mark in French language at elementary level. As at date, literature suggests that there is hardly any French language learning tools connected with pedagogical knowledge and technological tools suitable for those children. The rationale behind this paper is to show how gamification of French learning resources can positively affect SEN and especially DHH students’ understanding and level of achievement in the language. Research questions were posed about the difficulties faced when students of that specific group learn to read and write in French, about how the gamification of textual resources can be used to improve the students’ learning, and the impact the games have on the students. The aim of this research is to embed gamification in the teaching and learning process of French language. Advocating for both qualitative and quantitative methods, the project based itself on the pragmatic paradigm while the theoretical framework is based on action research. Using my methodological inventiveness, data was gathered using techniques such as surveys, interviews, observations and focus group discussions through the lenses of narrative inquiry.

medical,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations have been increasingly reported in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the roles of the GI tract in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not fully understood. We investigated how the GI tract is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. METHODS: Our previously established nonhuman primate (NHP) model of COVID-19 was modified in this study to test our hypothesis. Rhesus monkeys were infected with an intragastric or intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded after infection. Viral genomic RNA was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated by examining inflammatory cytokines, macrophages, histopathology and mucin barrier integrity. RESULTS: Intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 led to infections and pathological changes not only in respiratory tissues but also in digestive tissues. Expectedly, intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the productive infection of digestive tissues and inflammation in both the lung and digestive tissues. Inflammatory cytokines were induced by both types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the increased expression of CD68. Immunohistochemistry and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining showed decreased Ki67, increased cleaved caspase 3 and decreased numbers of mucin-containing goblet cells, suggesting that the inflammation induced by these two types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 impaired the GI barrier and caused severe infections. CONCLUSIONS: Both intranasal and intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 caused pneumonia and GI dysfunction in our rhesus monkey model. Inflammatory cytokines are possible connections for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 between the respiratory and digestive systems.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",kOWbyy
medical,"RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) have critical roles in numerous fundamental biological processes, such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, viral assembly, cellular defence and protein synthesis. As the number of available RNA-protein binding experimental data has increased rapidly due to high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to measure and understand RNA-protein interactions by computational methods. In this study, we integrate a sequence-based derived kernel with regularized least squares to perform prediction. The derived kernel exploits the contextual information around an amino acid or a nucleic acid as well as the repetitive conserved motif information. We propose a novel machine learning method, called RPiRLS to predict the interaction between any RNA and protein of known sequences. For the RPiRLS classifier, each protein sequence comprises up to 20 diverse amino acids but for the RPiRLS-7G classifier, each protein sequence is represented by using 7-letter reduced alphabets based on their physiochemical properties. We evaluated both methods on a number of benchmark data sets and compared their performances with two newly developed and state-of-the-art methods, RPI-Pred and IPMiner. On the non-redundant benchmark test sets extracted from the PRIDB, the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. The proposed method can also be extended to construct RNA-protein interaction networks.

medical,"The concurrent use of opioids, benzodiazepines (BZDs), and/or alcohol poses a formidable challenge for clinicians who manage chronic pain. While the escalating use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain and the concomitant rise in opioid-related abuse and misuse are widely recognized trends, the contribution of combination use of BZDs, alcohol, and/or other sedative agents to opioid-related morbidity and mortality is underappreciated, even when these agents are used appropriately. Patients with chronic pain who use opioid analgesics along with BZDs and/or alcohol are at higher risk for fatal/nonfatal overdose and have more aberrant behaviors. Few practice guidelines for BZD treatment are readily available, especially when they are combined clinically with opioid analgesics and other central nervous system-depressant agents. However, coadministration of these agents produces a defined increase in rates of adverse events, overdose, and death, warranting close monitoring and consideration when treating patients with pain. To improve patient outcomes, ongoing screening for aberrant behavior, monitoring of treatment compliance, documentation of medical necessity, and the adjustment of treatment to clinical changes are essential. In this article, we review the prevalence and pharmacologic consequences of BZDs and/or alcohol use among patients with pain on chronic opioid therapy, as well as the importance of urine drug testing, an indispensable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring, which helps to ensure the continued safety of patients. Regardless of risk or known aberrant drug-related behaviors, patients on chronic opioid therapy should periodically undergo urine drug testing to confirm adherence to the treatment plan.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EZBW9a
medical,"Owing to their low cost and high theoretical energy density, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly promising as a contender for post-lithium ion battery era. However, the intrinsic low reversible conversion ability of lithium polysulï¬des to sulfur/Li2S during charging/discharging seriously hinder the sulfur utilization, resulting in poor cycling life of batteries. Herein we report an improvement of core-shell structured sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets electrode materials prepared by a simple precipitation reaction method, in which the ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets as a catalytic layer can promote the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulï¬des and their conversion rates to sulfur/Li2S. Using a combination of UV-visible adsorption spectra and ï¬rst-principles calculation, the results indicate that the Mn-O coordination center on the surface of MnO2 structure plays an efficient catalytic role in the conversion reaction of lithium polysulï¬des to insoluble S/Li2S. The sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets composite with a high S mass ratio of 82 wt % reveal a high speciï¬c capacity of 846 mAh g-1 at 1C rate and good cycling stability.

medical,"BACKGROUND to avoid a new spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the post lockdown period requires the implementation of effective strategies for the case finding and contact tracing. The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. OBJECTIVES to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases. DESIGN Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated. RESULTS 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS the seroprevalence values ​​estimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence. Furthermore, the implementation of this test allowed the identification and isolation of completely asymptomatic subjects, that could have been identified only through screening with tests for viral RNA.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",qHwRRJ

medical,"Long-COVID-19 refers to the signs and symptoms that continue or develop after the “acute COVID-19” phase. These patients have an increased risk of multiorgan dysfunction, readmission, and mortality. In Long-COVID-19 patients, it is possible to detect a persistent increase in D-Dimer, NT-ProBNP, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. To verify the dysautonomia hypothesis in Long-COVID-19 patients, we studied heart rate variability using 12-lead 24-h ECG monitoring in 30 Long-COVID-19 patients and 20 No-COVID patients. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was lower in Long-COVID-19 patients both for total power (7.46 ± 0.5 vs. 8.08 ± 0.6; p < 0.0001; Cohens-d = 1.12) and for the VLF (6.84 ± 0.8 vs. 7.66 ± 0.6; p < 0.0001; Cohens-d = 1.16) and HF (4.65 ± 0.9 vs. 5.33 ± 0.9; p = 0.015; Cohens-d = 0.76) components. The LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in Long-COVID-19 patients (1.46 ± 0.27 vs. 1.23 ± 0.13; p = 0.001; Cohens-d = 1.09). On multivariable analysis, Long-COVID-19 is significantly correlated with D-dimer (standardized β-coefficient = 0.259), NT-ProBNP (standardized β-coefficient = 0.281), HF component of spectral analysis (standardized β-coefficient = 0.696), and LF/HF ratio (standardized β-coefficient = 0.820). Dysautonomia may explain the persistent symptoms in Long COVID-19 patients. The persistence of a procoagulative state and an elevated myocardial strain could explain vagal impairment in these patients.

Few studies have assessed their influence on skin characteristics. In a previous study, we identified the short‐term effects of wearing face masks. Herein, we describe the long‐term skin effects of face masks, for a period of 6 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers (19 men and women), who wore face masks, participated in the study from June 2020 to December 2020. In all participants, skin characteristics such as trans‐epidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, skin elasticity, skin pore area, skin keratin amount, skin temperature, skin redness, skin temperature, skin redness, and skin color were measured three times. RESULTS: TEWL, skin hydration, skin elasticity, skin pore area, skin keratin amount, and skin color changed significantly after 6 months. TEWL, skin hydration, skin pore area, skin keratin amount, and skin color were significantly different between the mask‐wearing and non‐mask‐wearing areas.

medical,"Abstract The nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus are processed by a virus-encoded proteinase which is located in the C-terminal domain of nsP2. Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UHc1IS

medical,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) using stenosis and plaque measures and subtended myocardial mass (Vsub) for fractional flow reserve (FFR) defined hemodynamically obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, the incremental diagnostic value of off-site CT-derived FFR (FFRCT) was assessed. METHODS Prospectively enrolled patients underwent CCTA followed by invasive FFR interrogation of all major coronary arteries. Vessels with ≥30% stenosis were included for analysis. On-site CCTA assessment included qualitative and quantitative stenosis (visual grading and minimal lumen area, MLA) and plaque measures (characteristics and volumes), and Vsub. Diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment was tested by comparing area under the curves (AUC). In vessels with available FFRCT, the incremental value of off-site FFRCT was tested. RESULTS In 236 vessels (132 patients), MLA, positive remodeling, non-calcified plaque volume, and Vsub were independent on-site CCTA predictors for hemodynamically obstructive CAD (p < 0.05 for all). Vsub/MLA2 outperformed all these on-site CCTA parameters (AUC = 0.85) and Vsub was incremental to all other CCTA predictors (p = 0.02). In subgroup analysis (n = 194 vessels), diagnostic performance of FFRCT and Vsub/MLA2 was similar (AUC 0.89 and 0.85 respectively, p = 0.25). Furthermore, diagnostic performance significantly albeit minimally increased when FFRCT was added to on-site CCTA assessment (ΔAUC = 0.03, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment, Vsub/MLA2 demonstrated greatest diagnostic value for hemodynamically obstructive CAD and Vsub was incremental to all evaluated CCTA indices. Additionally, adding FFRCT only minimally increased diagnostic performance, demonstrating that on-site CCTA assessment is a reasonable alternative to FFRCT.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",08oUol

Neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training at low and moderate altitudes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-This study evaluated neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training (SET) at low (295 m) and moderate (2,320 m) altitudes. Sixteen elite swimmers took part in a 3-week SET during a general preparation phase. All neuromuscular tests were performed a week before and after a SET. In posttraining, maximal knee isometric torque (TMVC) and soleus H-reflex remained statistically unchanged for sea-level (SL) and for altitude (AL) training. Rate of torque development (RTD) decreased post-SL (-14.5%; p < 0.01) but not post-AL (-4.7%; p > 0.05) training. Vastus lateralis electromyographic (EMG) activity during RTD decreased post-SL (-17.0%; P = 0.05) but not post-AL (4.8%; p > 0.05) training. Quadriceps twitch torque (TTW) significantly increased post-AL (12.1%; p < 0.01) but not post-SL (-1.0%; p > 0.05; training × altitude: F1,15 = 12.4; p < 0.01) training. Quadriceps twitch contraction time and M-wave amplitude remained statistically unchanged post-SL and post-AL training. After SL training, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in vastus lateralis EMG (R = 0.76; p < 0.01) and TTW (R = 0.48; p < 0.06). Posttraining in AL, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in TTW (R = 0.54; p < 0.05). Strength and endurance training at altitude seems to prompt adaptations in twitch contractile properties. In contrast, SET performed at SL may hamper the magnitude of neural adaptations to strength training, particularly during rapid voluntary contractions. In conclusion, SET at AL might benefit muscular adaptations in swimmers compared with training at SL.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GblU8u

medical,"BACKGROUND Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 and its consequences are present everywhere. Dutch professionals are concerned about the mental consequences, and in particular that during and after hospitalization little attention is paid to psychological problems. AIM To monitor the short-term course and severity of (neuro)psychiatric symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19. To make a recommendation regarding whether or not to follow-up these patients psychiatrically to optimize care. METHOD In an observational cohort-study screening questions and additional questionnaires were used during two follow-up contacts to monitor cognition (MoCA), affective symptoms (HADS and IES) and overall functioning. RESULTS More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. CONCLUSION (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common. The natural course for affective complaints is more favorable than for cognitive functions.

medical,"Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) may improve health, productivity and safety and reduce absenteeism. However, although desirable, it is difficult to design tailored (and thus effective) WHP programs, particularly in small–medium companies, which rarely have access to sufficient economic and organizational resources. In this study, 1305 employees filled out an online anonymous lifestyle questionnaire hosted on the website of a non-profit organization, which aims to promote a healthy lifestyle among workers. The data show gender differences regarding stress perception and, in the working population meeting current physical activity recommendations (threshold = 600 MET·min/week), they point out the evidence of a better psychological and nutrition profile, a perception of better job performance, and improved sleep and health quality. Moreover, a unitary index (ranging from 0–100 (with higher scores being healthier)), combining self-reported metrics for diet, exercise and stress, was significantly higher in active employees (67.51 ± 12.46 vs. 39.84 ± 18.34, p < 0.001). The possibility of assessing individual lifestyle in an easy, timely and cost-effective manner, offers the opportunity to collect grouped data useful to drive tailored WHP policies and to have metric to quantify results of interventions.

medical,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted every area of our lives, including delaying urgent dental care. However, studies evaluating how patients using dental prostheses have been affected by the pandemic are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how patients using different types of dental prostheses were being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 randomly selected individuals from among those who had been examined in the same clinic before the COVID-19 outbreak were included in the study. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to their type of prosthesis: complete dentures, implant-retained removable dentures, tooth-supported fixed partial dentures, and implant-supported fixed partial dentures. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire was implemented by telephone interviews with the study participants, who were also asked about their concerns and steps made regarding prosthetic hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis with forward selection was carried out to identify predictors of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) status (&#945;=.05). RESULTS: OHIP-14 total scores did not vary significantly among the groups (P>.05). When the domain scores of OHIP-14 were considered separately, the analysis revealed that the implant-retained removable denture group had significantly poorer functional limitations when compared with the tooth-supported fixed partial denture (P=.005) and implant-supported fixed partial denture (P=.031) groups. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant association between OHRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning (1 time a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.011; 2-3 times a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.032). CONCLUSIONS: All prosthesis users exhibited increased interest in dental hygiene and an increase in the frequency of prosthesis cleaning during the pandemic. Furthermore, the study determined that the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning was associated with significantly improved OHRQoL during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the denture groups, those treated with implant-retained removable dentures had the poorest functional limitation in terms of OHRQoL, which can be linked to postponement of routine maintenance appointments. Therefore, providing all patients with scientifically sound information on prosthetic care during a pandemic would be highly beneficial.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",joJ-er

medical,"BackgroundIn September 2021, the UK Government introduced a booster programme targeting individuals over 50 and those in a clinical risk group. Individuals were offered either a full dose of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine or a half dose of the mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) vaccine, irrespective of the vaccine received as the primary course MethodsWe used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) of the booster dose BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) in those aged over 50 against symptomatic disease in post booster time intervals compared to individuals at least 140 days post a second dose with no booster dose recorded. In a secondary analysis, we also compared to unvaccinated individuals and to the 2 to 6 day period after a booster dose was received. Analyses were stratified by which primary doses had been received and any mixed primary courses were excluded. ResultsThe relative VE estimate in the 14 days after the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) booster dose, compared to individuals that received a two-dose primary course, was 87.4 (95% confidence interval 84.9-89.4) in those individuals who received two doses ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca) as a primary course and 84.4 (95% confidence interval 82.8-85.8) in those individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) as a primary course. Using the 2-6 day period post the booster dose as the baseline gave similar results. The absolute VE from 14 days after the booster, using the unvaccinated baseline, was 93.1(95% confidence interval 91.7-94.3) in those with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca) as their primary course and 94.0 (93.4-94.6) for BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) as their primary course.

medical,"Vaccines containing multiple antigens may induce broader immune responses and provide better protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection as compared to a single antigen. However, strategies for incorporating multiple antigens into a single vector and the immunization routes may affect their immunogenicity. In this study, we utilized recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) as a model vaccine vector, and Ag85A (Rv3804c) and Mtb32 (Rv0125) as model antigens, to comparatively evaluate the influence of codon usage optimization, signal sequence, fusion linkers, and immunization routes on the immunogenicity of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine containing multiple antigens in C57BL/6 mice. We showed that codon-optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a GSG linker induced the strongest systemic and pulmonary cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Strong CMI responses were characterized by the generation of a robust IFN-γ ELISPOT response as well as antigen-specific CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, which secreted mono-, dual-, or multiple cytokines. We also found that subcutaneous (SC) and intranasal (IN)/oral immunization with this candidate vaccine exhibited the strongest boosting effects for Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-primed systemic and pulmonary CMI responses, respectively. Our results supported that codon optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a proper linker and immunized through SC and IN/oral routes can generate the strongest systemic and pulmonary CMI responses in BCG-primed mice, which may be particularly important for the design of TB vaccines containing multiple antigens.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1Rr2BH

However, whether mtDNA-CN is independently associated with the subsequent incidence of mental disorders remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used droplet digital PCR to measure the absolute mtDNA-CN in DNA samples obtained from a population-based follow-up study, which included a total of 2354 middle-aged women (52-63 years) who were free of mental disorders at baseline. After 17 years (median) of follow-up, 727 participants were diagnosed with mental disorders. RESULTS: In the univariate Cox regression, lower baseline mtDNA-CN (mtDNA-CN < 117) was associated with a higher risk of mental disorders (HR = 1.16, p = 0.047). In addition, smoking, marital status and sleeping quality were associated with both mtDNA-CN and mental disorders. After adjusting for these variables, the association between mtDNA-CN and mental disorders decreased and became non-significant (HR = 1.07, p = 0.36). Stratification of data according to the subtype of mental disorders, showed that low mtDNA-CN was associated with a higher risk of alcohol or drug use disorders (HR = 1.82, p = 0.045 after adjusting). CONCLUSION: In the present study, we could not find any independent association between mtDNA-CN blood and the most common mental disorders in a population-based follow-up study of Swedish women, except for alcohol and drug use disorders.

In this study, LL-37, a natural human antimicrobial peptide, was successfully modified on the PEKK surface with polydopamine as the intermediate layer and released continuously for more than 6 days. The results of the MTT assay, colony counts, and Live/Dead staining demonstrated that compared to unmodified PEKK, the LL-37-modified PEKK significantly inhibited the adhesion, vitality, and bacterial biofilm growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in a concentration-dependent way. Furthermore, the LL-37-modified PEKK enhanced biocompatibility (cell adhesion and viability) and promoted osteogenic differentiation of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Our data suggested that LL-37-modified PEKK might be a promising material for use in orthopedic implants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",22nLET

medical,"It can be life-saving to monitor the respiratory rate (RR) even for healthy people in real-time. It is reported that the infected people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), generally develop mild respiratory symptoms in the early stage. It will be more important to continuously monitor the RR of people in nursing homes and houses with a non-contact method. Conventional, contact-based, methods are not suitable for long-term health monitoring especially in-home care services. The potentials of wireless radio signals for health care applications, such as fall detection, etc., are examined in literature. In this paper, we focus on a device-free real-time RR monitoring system using wireless signals. In our recent study, we proposed a non-contact RR monitoring system with a batch processing (delayed) estimation method. In this paper, for real-time monitoring, we modify the standard joint unscented Kalman filter (JUKF) method for this new and time-critical problem. Due to the nonlinear structure of the RR estimation problem with respect to the measurements, a novel modification is proposed to transform measurement errors into parameter errors by using the hyperbolic tangent function. It is shown in the experiments conducted with the real measurements taken using healthy volunteers that the proposed modified joint unscented Kalman filter (ModJUKF) method achieves the highest accuracy according to the windowing-based methods in the time-varying RR scenario. It is also shown that the ModJUKF not only reduces the computational complexity approximately 8.54% but also improves the accuracy 36.7% with respect to the standard JUKF method.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GtxlbK

We sought to evaluate whether telemedicine consultation for vascular surgery can replace direct visits for patients in remote areas. Patients undergoing telemedicine consultation from 2014-2019 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) with a large rural catchment area, were reviewed. Primary outcomes included diagnosis, type and number of telemedicine visits, and types of surgical procedures scheduled after initial visit. 574 patients participated in 708 out-patient telemedicine consultations conducted by four vascular surgeons and two advanced practitioners. Visits took place at 21 clinics across Minnesota (n = 305), North Dakota (n = 96), South Dakota (n = 82), Wisconsin (n = 20), and Iowa (n = 2) with an average distance of 159 miles from the VAMC. There were 429 (75%) new patient visits and 279 (25%) follow-ups. After initial telemedicine consultation, 236 (55%) patients were booked for procedures.

medical,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has cost millions of deaths and lifelong consequences since December 2019. We attempted to evaluate the incidence, distribution, and risk factors associated with death after applying the social distance strategy to the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danang outbreak (July 2020), Vietnam. Methods: : We retrospectively reviewed the online Danang Hospital reports, gathering the epidemiological history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. We then conducted a descriptive analysis of Fisher's Phi Coefficient and Cramer's, along with multiple logistic regression models to test the effects of symptomatology and control measures performed by the Vietnamese government on transmission dynamics. The last report we examined was on August 29, 2020. Results: : 389 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases related to the Danang outbreak are included in our analysis with a mean age of 47.1 (SD = 18.4), involving 154 men and 235 women, 34 cases of death, and 355 were alive. The study showed significant results related to age, quarantine measures, previous negative SARS-CoV-2 test, and a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath and myalgia (p-value < 0.05). Our multiple-variable analysis suggested the significant risk of death was related to age, severe symptomology, undetected SARS-CoV-2 test results, and prior quarantined SARS-CoV-2 history. Conclusions: : Vietnamese authorities had implemented successful quarantine practices to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. However, this virus has shown dynamic spread beyond the ability of the country to control its transmission.

We thus estimate basic reproductive numbers by region before isolation (between 2.4 and 3.1), the percentage of infected people over time (between 2.0 and 5.9% as of May 11th, 2020) and the impact of nationwide household confinement on the infection rate (decreasing the transmission rate by 72% toward a Re ranging from 0.7 to 0.9).

medical,"Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors present different expression profiles related to the prognosis of COVID-19. We analyzed clinical parameters and assessed the expression of these biomarkers in patients with different disease severity in a hospitalized Peruvian cohort to determine those associated with worse prognosis. We measured anti-spike IgG antibodies by ELISA and 30 cytokines by quantitative suspension array technology in 123 sera samples. We analyzed differences between patients with moderate, severe and fatal COVID-19 by logistic regression at baseline and in longitudinal samples. Significant differences were found among the clinical parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine and D-dimer levels. Higher anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal patient outcomes. At hospitalization, IL-10, IL-6, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFα and IL-8 levels were already increased in fatal patients´ group. Meanwhile, multivariable analysis revealed that increased GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, and IL-8 values were associated with fatal outcomes. Moreover, longitudinal analysis identified IL-6 and MCP-1 as the main risk factors related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this Peruvian cohort we identified and validated biomarkers related to COVID-19 outcomes. Further studies are needed to identify novel criteria for stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital entry. BACKGROUND: In the most severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells become activated and begin to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. METHODS: A total of 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen in Lima, Peru were enrolled during August-October 2020. Of these, 21 had moderate disease, 24 severe diseases and 10 died. We measured 30 cytokines and chemokines by quantitative suspension array technology and anti-spike IgG antibodies using a commercial ELISA. We evaluated these parameters in peripheral blood every 2-5 days until patient discharge or death. Patient information and clinical parameters related were obtained from the respective clinical histories. RESULTS: The frequency of obesity differed among the 3 groups, being most frequent in patients who died. There were also significant differences in clinical parameters: hemoglobin, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes,C-reactive protein, creatinine and D-dimer levels. Greater anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal outcomes. In univariate analyses, higher baseline concentrations of IL-6, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFα, IL-8 and IL-12p70 correlated with severity, while multivariable analysis showed that increased concentrations in 4 biomarkers (GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-8) were associated with fatal outcomes. Longitudinal analysis showed IL-6 (hazard ratio [HR] 6.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-28.7) and MCP-1 (HR 4.61, 95%CI 1.1-19.1) to be related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine, chemokine and growth factor profiles were identified and validated related to severity and outcomes of COVID-19.

medical,"Drinking in private or other unlicensed settings before going out (i.e., pre-drinking) is increasingly being identified as a common behaviour amongst students as it provides an opportunity to extend their drinking duration and socialise. However, studies suggest associations between pre-drinking and alcohol-related harms. This study examines Brazilian and British university students' pre-drinking patterns and associations with nightlife-related harms amongst drinkers. A total of 1,151 Brazilian and 424 British students (aged 18+ years) completed an online survey. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic variables, nightlife drinking behaviour including pre-drinking and past 12 months experience of alcohol-related harms. Most participants were female (BRA 59.1%, ENG 65.3%; p = 0.027), undergraduate students (BRA 88.2%, ENG 71.2%; p<0.001) and aged 18-25 years (BRA 78.8%, ENG 81.5%; p<0.001). Pre-drinking was more prevalent in England (82.8%) than Brazil (44.0%; p<0.001), yet Brazilian students drank more units of alcohol than British students when pre-drinking (BRA 17.6, ENG 12.1; p<0.001). In multi-variate analyses, pre-drinking was significantly associated with increased odds of experiencing a range of harms across both countries (e.g., blackouts; failing to attend university), with the strength of associations varying between countries. Pre-drinking in Brazil and in England is an important event before going out amongst university students, however our study shows it is associated with a range of harms in both countries. Thus, preventing pre-drinking may be a crucial strategy to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in the nightlife context across countries with diverse nightlife environments and alcohol drinking cultures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gkvQ7X

medical,"BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was first recognized in December 2019, is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that is having a devastating impact on human health, society and the global economy. METHODS We summarize lessons learned from the HIV epidemic that offer insights about how the response to COVID-19 can be improved, especially in the United States which has incurred one quarter of world's infections to date. RESULTS Lessons learned include: the need to develop and deploy valid tests for point-of-care diagnosis and surveillance; the importance of considering HIV and COVID-19 in the context of syndemics; the potential role of structural interventions that address drivers of disparities; how existing research infrastructure can be leveraged to accelerate development of therapeutics and vaccines; and how modeling that is tailored to regional epidemics can inform policy. CONCLUSIONS The window of opportunity to prevent a widespread COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has already closed, but it is not too late to implement a mitigation strategy that can save thousands of lives. Decisive leadership that develops policies grounded in scientific evidence is key to charting a path forward. The question is whether the United States is prepared to learn from its past successes and mistakes with the HIV epidemic to develop a nation-wide plan that puts politics aside and prioritizes saving lives.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6CphuW

medical,"AIM: To provide a population-based characterization of sociodemographic and clinical risk and protective factors associated with consumption of alcohol, tobacco, or both as a coping strategy in a sample of the Spanish general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. The survey consisted of an ad hoc questionnaire comprising clinical and sociodemographic information and the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: The final sample included 21,207 individuals [mean age (SD) = 39.7 (14.0); females: 14,768 (69.6%)]. Up to 2867 (13.5%) of participants reported using alcohol, 2545 (12%) tobacco and 1384 (6.5%) both substances as a strategy to cope with the pandemic. Sex-related factors were associated with alcohol consumption as a coping strategy [female, OR = 0.600, p < 0.001]. However, education level, work status, and income played different roles depending on the substance used to cope. Having a current mental disorder was associated only with tobacco consumption as a coping strategy [OR = 1.391, p < 0.001]. Finally, sex differences were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors were associated with consumption of alcohol, tobacco, or both as a coping method for the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Our findings may help develop specific intervention programs reflecting sex differences, which could minimize negative long-term outcomes of substance use after this pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",YvSySK

medical,"IntroductionHealth care workers (HCW) are among the most vulnerable for contracting the COVID-19 infection. Understanding the extent of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 infection among HCW is critical in management of this infection and for policy making. We did this study to observe seropositivity and estimate new infection by seroconversion among HCW and predict the risk factors for infection. MethodsA cohort study was conducted at a tertiary dedicated COVID-19 hospital in New Delhi during first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. All HCW working in the hospital during the study period who come in contact with the patients, were our study population. The data was collected by a detailed face to face interview along with serological assessment for anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline and endline, and assessment of daily symptoms. Prediction of potential risk factors for seroprevalence and seroconversion was done by logistic regression keeping the significance at p<0.05. ResultsA total of 192 HCW were recruited in this study, out of which, 119 (61.97%) at baseline and 108 (77.7%) at endline were seropositive for COVID-19. About two-third (63.5%) had close contact, 5.2% had exposure during aerosol procedures, 30.2% had exposure with a patients body fluid while majority (85.4%) had exposure to contact surface around the patient. Almost all were wearing PPE and following IPC measures during their recent contact with a COVID-19 patient. Seroconversion was observed among 36.7% of HCWs while 64.0% had a serial rise in titer of antibodies during the follow-up period. Association of seropositivity was observed negatively with doctors [OR:0.353, CI:0.176-0.710], COVID-19 symptoms [OR:0.210, CI:0.054-0.820], comorbidities [OR:0.139, CI: 0.029 - 0.674], and recent Infection Prevention Control (IPC) training [OR:0.250, CI:0.072 - 0.864], while positively associated with partially [OR:3.303, CI: 1.256-8.685], as well as fully vaccination for COVID-19 [OR:2.428, CI:1.118-5.271]. Seroconversion was positively associated with doctor as profession [OR: 13.04, CI: 3.39 - 50.25] and with partially [OR: 4.35, CI: 1.070 - 17.647], as well as fully vaccinated for COVID-19 [OR: 6.08, CI: 1.729 - 21.40]. No significant association was observed between adherence to any of the IPC measures and PPE (personal protective equipment) adopted by the HCW during the recent contact with COVID-19 patients and seroconversion. ConclusionA high seropositivity and seroconversion could be either due to exposure to COVID-19 patients or concurrent immunization against COVID-19 disease. In this study the strongest association of seropositivity and seroconversion was observed with recent vaccination. IPC measures were practiced by almost all the HCW in these settings, and thus were not found to be affecting seroconversion. Further study using anti N antibodies serology, which are positive following vaccination may help us to find out the reason for the seropositivity and seroconversion in HCW.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ad5UYH

medical,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern for healthcare workers getting infected via aerosol from non-invasive respiratory support of infants. Attaching filters that remove viral particles in air from the expiratory limb of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices should theoretically decrease the risk. However, adding filters to the expiratory limb could add to expiratory resistance and thereby increase the imposed work of breathing (WOB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects on imposed WOB when attaching filters to the expiratory limb of CPAP devices. METHODS: Two filters were tested on three CPAP systems at two levels of CPAP in a mechanical lung model. Main outcome was imposed WOB. RESULTS: There was a minor increase in imposed WOB when attaching the filters. The differences between the two filters were small. CONCLUSION: To minimise contaminated aerosol generation during CPAP treatment, filters can be attached to expiratory tubing with only a minimal increase in imposed WOB in a non-humidified environment. Care has to be taken to avoid filter obstruction and replace filters as recommended.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",AjtSXQ

medical,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a major public health challenge in 2020. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most effective method to control disease spread and prevent further mortality. As such, a high-precision and rapid yet economic assay method is urgently required. Herein, we propose an innovative method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using isothermal amplification of nucleic acids on a mesh containing multiple microfluidic pores. Hybridization of pathogen DNA and immobilized probes forms a DNA hydrogel by rolling circle amplification and, consequently, blocks the pores to prevent fluid movement, as observed. Following optimization of several factors, including pore size, mesh location, and precision microfluidics, the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 0.7 aM at 15-min incubation. These results indicate rapid, easy, and effective detection with a moderate-sized LOD of the target pathogen by remote point-of-care testing and without the requirement of any sophisticated device.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gV9Ygw

medical,"Declared as a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has brought about a dramatic change in the working of different laboratories across the country. Diagnostic laboratories testing different types of samples play a vital role in the treatment management. Irrespective of their size, each laboratory has to follow strict biosafety guidelines. Different sections of the laboratory receive samples that are variably infectious. Each sample needs to undergo a proper and well-designed processing system so that the personnel involved are not infected and also their close contacts. It takes a huge effort so as to limit the risk of exposure of the working staff during the collection, processing, reporting or dispatching of biohazard samples. Guidelines help in preventing the laboratory staff and healthcare workers from contracting the disease which has a known human to human route of transmission and high rate of mortality. A well-knit approach is the need of the hour to combat this fast spreading disease.

medical,"In many markets, consumers visit stores and physically inspect products before making purchase decisions. We view the inspection of a product at a retail location as a search for product fit. We quantify the cost and benefit from searching for product fit using a discrete choice model of demand with optimal sequential search. In these models, the benefit of searching is measured by the standard deviation of the product fit and has, heretofore, been fixed to one in estimation. We show that, with an exogenous search cost shifter, both the cost and benefit of searching can be separately estimated. Our empirical setting is the U.S. automotive market. We assemble a unique data set containing individual-level smartphone geolocation data that inform us about dealership visits. We also obtain information on new vehicle purchases from proprietary DMV registration data. Our exogenous cost shifter is the distance a consumer must travel to visit a dealership. Our results show that the benefit provided by dealerships to consumers is substantial. Within our empirical context, failure to estimate the standard deviation of the product fit leads to biased search cost and consumer surplus estimates and to inaccurate predictions regarding consumers’ number of searches and effects of at-home test drive programs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uAzDJT

medical,"The Nrf2 transcription factor governs the expression of hundreds genes involved in cell defense against oxidative stress, the hallmark of numerous diseases such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, some viral pathologies, diabetes and others. The main route for Nrf2 activity regulation is via interactions with the Keap1 protein. Under the normoxia the Keap1 binds the Nrf2 and targets it to the proteasomal degradation, while the Keap1 is regenerated. Upon oxidative stress the interactions between Nrf2 and Keap1 are interrupted and the Nrf2 activates the transcription of the protective genes. Currently, the Nrf2 system activation is considered as a powerful cytoprotective strategy for treatment of different pathologies, which pathogenesis relies on oxidative stress including viral diseases of pivotal importance such as COVID-19. The implementation of this strategy is accomplished mainly through the inactivation of the Keap1 “guardian” function. Two approaches are now developing: the Keap1 modification via electrophilic agents, which leads to the Nrf2 release, and direct interruption of the Nrf2:Keap1 protein-protein interactions (PPI). Because of theirs chemical structure, the Nrf2 electrophilic inducers could non-specifically interact with others cellular proteins leading to undesired effects. Whereas the non-electrophilic inhibitors of the Nrf2:Keap1 PPI could be more specific, thereby widening the therapeutic window.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jvpw91

Methods: We conducted an exploratory descriptive study of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ghana from March 12 to June 30, 2020. Data was merged from the country's electronic databases, cleaned and summarized using medians, proportions and geospatial analysis. Design: A cross-sectional study design. Setting: Ghana. Participants: All confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ghana from March 12 to June 30, 2020. Interventions: None. Main Outcome measures: Epidemiological characterization of all confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded from March 12 - June 30, 2020 in Ghana by person, place and time. Results: A total of 17,763 cases were recorded with median age (IQR) of 33years (One month to 85 years). Among the confirmed cases, 10,272 (57.8%) were males and 3,521 (19.8%) were symptomatic with cough recorded in 1,420 (40.3%) cases. The remaining 14,242 (80.2%) were asymptomatic. Greater Accra region recorded the highest number of confirmed cases 11,348 (63.9%). All 16 administrative regions had recorded cases of COVID-19 by June 30, 2020 due to internal migration between the hotspots and other regions. The epidemiological curve showed a propagated outbreak with 117 deaths (CFR= 0.67%) recorded. Conclusion: A propagated outbreak of COVID - 19 was confirmed in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Internal migration from hotspots to other regions led to the spread of the virus across the nation. Majority of cases were asymptomatic.

medical," Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Limb girdle muscular dystrophy LGMD Summary Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders which affect the voluntary muscles around the hips and shoulders. The conditions are progressive, leading to a loss of muscle strength and bulk over a number of years. Onset may occur in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. [1] Most forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several rare forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. [2] While there are no treatments which directly reverse the muscle weakness associated with this condition, supportive treatment can decrease the complications. [3] There are at least 20 different types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. [1] Inheritance Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is most often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; less commonly, rare sub-types may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There may be difficulties diagnosing the condition accurately, and often the mode of inheritance cannot be determined. Therefore, it may be challenging to determine the exact recurrence risks for some families. Establishing the type of LGMD in an affected individual can be useful for discussing the clinical course of the disease as well as for determining who else in the family may be at risk for the condition. [4] Diagnosis Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person's medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Treatment Unfortunately, no definitive treatments for LGMD exist. Management depends on each individual and the specific type of LGMD that the individual has. However, the American Academy of Neurology has developed guidelines for treatment of LGMD including: [5] [6] Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures (fixed tightening of the muscles) Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications, such as foot deformity and scoliosis cardiomyopathy A team approach to treatment is recommended including a neurologist , pulmonologist , cardiologist , orthopedic surgeon, physiatrist , physical/occupational/ speech therapist , nutritionist , orthopedist , mental health counselors, and geneticist / genetic counselor . [5] [6] While not a currently available treatment option, some studies have shown promising results with the use of gene therapy . More research is needed to prove the safety and efficacy of this treatment approach. [6] Management Guidelines The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the medical specialty society of neurologists, offers a summary of recommended guidelines for Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Project OrphanAnesthesia is a project whose aim is to create peer-reviewed, readily accessible guidelines for patients with rare diseases and for the anesthesiologists caring for them. The project is a collaborative effort of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Orphanet, the European Society of Pediatric Anesthesia, anesthetists and rare disease experts with the aim to contribute to patient safety. Related Diseases Related diseases are conditions that have similar signs and symptoms. A health care provider may consider these conditions in the table below when making a diagnosis. Please note that the table may not include all the possible conditions related to this disease. Conditions with similar signs and symptoms from Orphanet The differential diagnosis of LGMD includes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, myotonic, myofibrillar, distal and metabolic myopathy, collagen 6-related disorders and dermatomyosistis.

medical,"AIM: To investigate the inhibition features of the natural product juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) against the three key enzymes from Helicobacter pylori (cystathionine γ-synthase [HpCGS], malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase [HpFabD], and β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase [HpFabZ]). METHODS: An enzyme inhibition assay against HpCGS was carried out by using a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach. The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach. RESULTS: Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC(50) values of 7.0±0.7, 20±1, and 30±4 μmol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl-L-homoserine (K(i)=αK(i)=24 μmol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (αK(i)=7.4 μmol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (K(i)=6.8 μmol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level.

One hundred and eighty-two subjects (111 men and 71 women) aged from 32 to 71 years have been consecutively followed at home in telemedicine from 1(st) September to 24(th) December 2020. We were informed almost twice daily in morning and evening about body temperature, symptoms (cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle of body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea), oxygen saturation measured by digital pulse oximetry and blood pressure. Our protocol of treatment was based on early use of prednisone (25 mg in the morning and 12.5 mg in the afternoon) and low molecular weight heparin (4000 UI one or two times daily) initiated just after the positivity of molecular nasopharyngeal test (about 3-4 days as mean time after initiation of symptomatology and not after 7-8 days as suggested by other protocols) and oxygen therapy when necessary. Antibiotics such as azithromycin for six days was added. It is always recommended to associate lansoprazole 30 mg to prevent gastric hemorrhages and potassium and magnesium supplements. This treatment scheme was able to reduce the risk of hospitalization as only 4 patients needed to be admitted to the Hospital, and only two in subintensive department. After negativeness of molecular nasopharyngeal test, patients were invited for a thoracic computerized tomography and laboratory evaluation of d-dimer and other data of inflammation to show eventual lung interstitial involvement characteristic of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RGD9op

medical,"Resource allocation under non-emergency conditions is often challenging.

An intentional value-based decision-making approach in such circumstances can clarify the values that ought to guide decisions, offering transparency and consistency, among other benefits. We use the example of vaccine allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore value-based decision-making within a PHE context. We describe several core values that are relevant to PHE decision-making and outline their implications for approaches to vaccine allocation.

medical,"KCNQ5 is suggestively associated with myopia, but its specific role in the myopic process has not been studied further. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of potassium channel gene KCNQ5 and the changes of K(+) microenvironment within the retina of form deprivation myopia (FDM) guinea pigs. A total of 60 guinea pigs were randomly divided into the normal control (NC) group, the self-control (SC) group, and the form-deprivation (FD) group for different treatments. Molecular assays and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were conducted to measure the expression and distribution of KCNQ5-related gene and protein in the retina. We determined the K(+) concentration in the retina. In addition, the possible effects of form deprivation on potassium ionic currents and the pharmacological sensitivity of KCNQ5 activator Retigabine and inhibitor XE991 to the M-current in RPE cells were investigated using the patch-clamp technique. As a result, FD eyes exhibited more myopic refraction and longer AL. The mRNA and protein levels of KCNQ5 significantly decreased in the FD eyes, but the K(+) concentration increased. In addition, the M-type K(+) current [IK((M))] density decreased in FD RPE cells, and were activated or inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner due to the addition of Retigabine or XE991. Overall, KCNQ5 was significantly downregulated in the retina of FD guinea pigs, which may be associated with the increasing K(+) concentration, decreasing IK((M)) density, and elongating ocular axis. It suggested that KCNQ5 may play a role in the process of myopia, and the intervention of potassium channels may contribute to the prevention and control of myopia.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",srRa3w

medical,"Total laryngectomy involves removal of the vocal cords resulting in the loss of vocal function. After laryngectomy, the patient's vocal function can be restored in several ways, including the insertion of a tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt. A TE shunt is considered an effective means of restoring speech due to its high efficacy, low requirement for training, and no need for any equipment while speaking. However, complications such as saliva inflow into the trachea, caused by the widening of the shunt opening, have also been reported. Moreover, the optimal treatment for an enlarged fistula has not yet been established. A fistula may also form at sites of hypopharyngeal reconstruction with free jejunal transplantation. Following its formation, the influx of saliva, infections, and pressure exerted by the act of swallowing make a fistula resistant to closure, and most patients require closure surgery using myocutaneous flaps. We encountered a case where an intractable TE fistula formed due to a TE shunt after the patient underwent total pharyngolaryngeal resection for hypopharyngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal reconstruction with a free jejunum flap. Since the optimal method for the TE fistula closure remains uncertain, we attempted to close the fistula according to the fistula closure of the free jejunal transplantation. Failure to close a TE fistula using a myocutaneous flap necessitates a re-closure procedure. However, because the surgical field around the trachea can be limited in such patients, creating an additional myocutaneous flap may not be feasible. In addition to the myocutaneous flap, ventilation control using a conventional intubation tube may further narrow the surgical field during the re-closure surgery. Based on our experience and existing literature, in this article, we summarize several ways of managing TE fistula when the surgical field around the trachea is limited.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1d9syE

medical," Prostate cancer treatment Summary Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your health care provider will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your provider may recommend one treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be two or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your provider must think about include: Your age and other medical problems you may have Side effects that occur with each type of treatment How much the prostate cancer has spread Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your provider to explain these things following about your treatment choices: Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical Prostatectomy (Prostate Removal) Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: Appetite loss Diarrhea Erection problems Fatigue Rectal burning or injury Skin reactions Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Prostate Brachytherapy Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum Red-brown urine or semen Impotence Incontinence Urinary retention Diarrhea Hormonal Therapy Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer.

medical,"Introduction Risk factors for seriously ill coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients have been reported in several studies. However, to date, few studies have reported simple risk assessment tools for distinguishing patients becoming severely ill after initial diagnosis. Hence, this study aimed to develop a simple clinical risk nomogram predicting oxygenation risk in patients with COVID-19 at the first triage. Methods This retrospective study involved a chart review of the medical records of 84 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 2020 and March 2021 at ten medical facilities. The patients were divided into requiring no oxygen therapy (non-severe group) and requiring oxygen therapy (severe group). Patient characteristics were compared between the two groups. We utilized univariate logistic regression analysis to confirm determinants of high risks of requiring oxygen therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19. Results Thirty-five patients ware in severe group and forty-nine patients were in non-severe group. In comparison with patients in the non-severe group, patients in the severe group were significantly older with higher body mass index (BMI), and had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the severe group. Multivariate analysis showed that older age, higher BMI, and higher BUN levels were significantly associated with oxygen requirements. Conclusions This study demonstrated that age, BMI, and BUN were independent risk factors in the moderate-to-severe COVID-19 group. Elderly patients with higher BMI and BUN require close monitoring and early treatment initiation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gsypks

medical,"Many school districts provide one-time transition events to help students prepare for the rigors of kindergarten; yet, research shows families desire additional information and opportunities to help their children thrive once school begins. Researchers for this study interviewed 39 parents whose children participated in a three-week structured kindergarten transition program designed to promote parental involvement in school, reduce students’ chronic absenteeism, and increase children’s readiness for kindergarten. All interviewees expressed that participating in the program yielded benefits for themselves and their children. Respondents shared that meeting education staff members early during the summer, familiarizing themselves with the layout and routines of their schools, and building stronger social connections with other families were of particular value in helping them prepare for the start of kindergarten. Similarly, understanding kindergarten expectations more thoroughly and acquiring tools to support their children at home were deemed especially beneficial for those families who had not previously participated in preschool or other structured school opportunities. In addition to positive feedback, participants proposed various ways that adjusting the program could better meet the needs of all stakeholders. Suggestions included increasing the length of the student sessions, improving communication between district and families, re-structuring the parent information sessions to be more conducive to working families, and staffing the program with more individuals who would stay on as teachers during the transition from summer to fall. Parent suggestions from this study were synthesized into multiple implications for practice and substantiated by current relevant literature.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oSfcr7

medical,"The routine evaluation of water environments is necessary to manage enteric virus-mediated fecal contamination and the possible emergence of novel variants. Here, we detected human rotavirus A (HRVA) circulating in two wastewater treatment plants, two lakes, irrigation water and a wastewater landfill located in Riyadh. VP7-derived surface protein sequences were assessed by phylogenetic analyses and inspection of thermotolerance-mediated secondary structure and seasonal variation. HRVA was most prevalent at An-Nazim wastewater landfill (AN-WWLF; 63.89%). Phylogenetic analyzes revealed the predominance of HRVA G2 lineage for the first time in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, a single HRVA sequence (2B64I-ANLF3/2018) was recovered at 45 °C from AN-WWLF; secondary structure prediction indicated that this sequence was thermotolerant with a high hydrophobicity, an absence of Ramachandran outliers, and a higher content of proline patches on the protein surface. Varied relationships were significantly observed between sampling areas influenced by temperature ranges (p < 0.05). HRVA prevalence was influenced by seasonal variations, favoring moderate temperatures in late autumn and early winter in all locations. However, a significant temperature impact was detected in Wadi-Hanifah Lake (p = 0.01). Our study extends the knowledge of currently circulating HRVA genotypes, and indicates the probable emergence of thermotolerant strains and seasonally mediated HRVA prevalence.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",JzhikI

[1] Signs and symptoms include severe  intellectual disability , problems with movement, and  seizures that are difficult or impossible to treat. [1] [2] While the exact cause of bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. [2] Most cases appear to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] [3] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional. Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. Although polymicrogyria as a broad category of disorders is collectively believed to be fairly common, each individual type (such as bilateral generalized polymicrogyria) is probably rare.

BACKGROUND PELD has gained acceptance for treating patients with IDC. The Bi-needle technique was designed to improve the efficiency and safety of PELD. METHOD Bi-needle and TESSYS group within each cohort were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching. Finally, 32 patients with IDC treated by Bi-needle technique from December 2015 to September 2017 were enrolled and 25 patients treated by TESSYS technique from the same spine surgery center between January 2013 and October 2017 were enrolled as controls. RESULTS Propensity score matching generated 22 Bi-needle and 22 TESSYS patients. There were no significant differences in visual analog scale and lumbar Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores between Bi-needle and TESSYS group. Operative time and rate of complications in the Bi-needle was significantly better than the TESSYS group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Both surgical methods achieved good clinical outcomes.

This study aimed to explain COVID-19 vaccination decision-making process to inform vaccine communication with patients and the public. Building on quantitative research on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, we conducted a grounded theory study, collecting 30 qualitative interviews with employees at a U.S. university that provided vaccine eligibility in December 2020. Analysis followed the Sort and Sift, Think and Shift method. Participants who had chosen to receive the vaccine and those who had not both described five factors that impacted their decision-making: emotional response, understanding, personal values, culture, and social norms. Across these factors, we identified three cross-cutting themes: time, trust, and communication tactics. In a time of emerging science and changing answers, the constant introduction of new information created information overload for participants. COVID-19 vaccine development was a ""grand experiment globally,"" which required trust, not only knowledge, to overcome hesitancy.

medical,"Benefits of quitting tobacco (Summary): If you smoke, you should quit. But quitting can be hard. Most people who have quit smoking have tried at least once, without success, in the past. View any past attempts to quit as a learning experience, not a failure.   There are many reasons to quit using tobacco. Long-term use of tobacco can increase your risk of many serious health problems.   THE BENEFITS OF QUITTING   You may enjoy the following when you quit smoking.     - Your breath, clothes, and hair will smell better.   - Your sense of smell will return. Food will taste better.   - Your fingers and fingernails will slowly appear less yellow.   - Your stained teeth may slowly become whiter.   - Your children will be healthier and will be less likely to start smoking.   - It will be easier and cheaper to find an apartment or hotel room.   - You may have an easier time getting a job.   - Friends may be more willing to be in your car or home.   - It may be easier to find a date. Many people do not smoke and do not like to be around people who smoke.   - You will save money. If you smoke a pack a day, you spend about $2,000 a year on cigarettes.      HEALTH BENEFITS   Some health benefits begin almost immediately. Every week, month, and year without tobacco further improves your health.     - Within 20 minutes of quitting: Your blood pressure and pulse rate drop to normal and the temperature of your hands and feet increases to normal.   - Within 8 hours of quitting: Your blood carbon monoxide levels drop and your blood oxygen levels increase to normal levels.   - Within 24 hours of quitting: Your risk of a sudden heart attack goes down.   - Within 48 hours of quitting: Your nerve endings begin to regrow. Your senses of smell and taste begin to return to normal.   - Within 2 weeks to 3 months of quitting: Your circulation improves. Walking becomes easier. Your lungs work better. Wounds heal more quickly.   - Within 1 to 9 months of quitting: You have more energy. Smoking-related symptoms, such as coughing, nasal congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath improve. You will have fewer illnesses, colds, and asthma attacks. You will gradually no longer be short of breath with everyday activities.   - Within 1 year of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone still using tobacco.   - Within 5 years of quitting: Your risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers are reduced by half.   - Within 10 years of quitting: Your risk of dying from lung cancer is about one half that of a person who still smokes.      Other health benefits of quitting smoking include:      - Lower chance of blood clots in the legs, which may travel to the lungs   - Lower risk of erectile dysfunction   - Fewer problems during pregnancy, such as babies born at low birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and cleft lip   - Lower risk of infertility due to damaged sperm   - Healthier teeth, gums, and skin      Infants and children who you live with will have:     - Asthma that is easier to control   - Fewer visits to the emergency room   - Fewer colds, ear infections, and pneumonia   - Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)      MAKING THE DECISION   Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult, especially if you do it alone. There are a lot of ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you. Talk to your health care provider about nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medications.    If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success.

medical,"BACKGROUND: In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5–17 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5–11 years) and older (age 12–17 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5–17 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62·2%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55·0%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3–11) versus 3 days (2–7) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 0·19, p<0·0001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3–12) than younger children (5 days, 2–9). 77 (4·4%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5·1%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3·1%] of 588 younger children; p=0·046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84·4%] of 77), headache (60 [77·9%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77·9%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1–4) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4–8). Only 25 (1·8%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0·9%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7·7–11·0 vs 8, 6–9) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1·5–6·5 vs 2, 1–4) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

We considered two scenarios: one is conservative and the other is nonconservative. By combining the above two scenarios, we gave an interval estimation of 0.0001-0.0027 and in terms of the population, 5200-139,900 is the number of undetected asymptomatic cases in South Korea as of 2 February 2021. In addition, we provide estimates for total cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Combination of undetected asymptomatic cases and undetected symptomatic cases to the number of confirmed cases (78,844 cases on 2 February 2021) shows that 0.17-0.42% (89,244-218,744) of the population have COVID-19. In conclusion, to control and understand the true ongoing reality of the pandemic, it is of outermost importance to focus on the ratio of undetected asymptomatic cases in the total population.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-bdOrM
medical,"Background: Little is known about the occurrence of bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the related clinical consequences. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled occurrence of BSIs among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and mortality of this patient population. Methods: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to 19 April 2021. The primary outcome was the occurrence of BSIs among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The secondary outcome was mortality at the longest available follow-up. Results: Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 42,694 patients evaluated. The estimated occurrence of BSIs was 7.3% (95% CI 4.7–1.1%) among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 41% (95% CI 30%–52.8%). The subgroup analysis conducted on patients admitted to ICU provided an estimated occurrence of 29.6% (95% CI 21.7%–38.8%). A higher occurrence of BSI was observed in patients with COVID-19, in comparison with patients without COVID-19 (OR 2.77; 95% CI 1.53–5.02; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our analysis estimated the occurrence of BSIs among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at around 7%. A four-times higher occurrence was estimated among patients admitted to ICU.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dsqb0p

medical,Teaching success is determined not only by the ability motivation and activeness of students in learning and the completeness of learning facilities / environments it will also depend a lot on the ability of teachers to develop various teaching skills. In order to prevent a greater spread of COVID-19 the Minister of Education and Culture issued Circular Number 36962 / MPK.A / HK / 2020 so that all teaching and learning activities both in schools and in universities can be carried out using online learning methods (online). I use the Zoom application so I can interact with students even though its only in cyberspace so the teacher’s role is not lost. The advantage of the Zoom application compared to other applications is that this application can be accessed for free. With learning activities using the ZOOM application it is expected to improve the learning outcomes of class V SD Negeri Gentan 04. In this study we used a contributive causal research method. The results showed that the use of Zoom can increase the minimum learning completeness namely an increase of 20% in cycle 1 and up to 14% in cycle 2,Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7NPYOq

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: It is well known that nucleic acids adopt a double-helical structure that is essential in the storage and replication of genetic code. However, noncanonical structures of DNA are less explored. The most important of these structures are the G-quadruplexes, which are formed by guanine-rich sequences of the genome. These G-quadruplexes were found in several crucial positions of the genome; they regulate important processes such as cell proliferation and death. Here we are investigating the quadruplex structures appearing in the genome of the hepatitis B, whose infection is among the ten leading causes of death. Our unique approach—the high-pressure technique—allowed us to characterize the stability of these quadruplexes in wide temperature and pressure ranges. Pressure experiments gave us the volume changes occurring at the unfolding, e.g., the embedded volume of the folded structure. Volumetric parameters are especially important because the space available for molecules is quite limited in the crowded environment of the cell. We also investigated how the stability of the viral quadruplexes can be increased by the binding of TMPyP4, a special ligand developed for cancer therapy. ABSTRACT: G-quadruplexes are noncanonical structures formed by guanine-rich sequences of the genome. They are found in crucial loci of the human genome, they take part in the regulation of important processes like cell proliferation and cell death. Much less is known about the subjects of this work, the viral G-quadruplexes. We have chosen three potentially G-quadruplex-forming sequences of hepatitis B. We measured the stability and the thermodynamic parameters of these quadruplexes. We also investigated the potential stabilization of these G-quadruplexes by binding a special ligand that was originally developed for cancer therapy. Fluorescence and infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed over wide temperature and pressure ranges. Our experiments indicate the small unfolding volume change of all three oligos. We found a difference between the unfolding of the 2-quartet and the 3-quartet G-quadruplexes. All three G-quadruplexes were stabilized by TMPyP4, which is a cationic porphyrin developed for stabilizing the human telomere.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uUXIOd

medical,"This study analyzed the asymmetric impact of the physical infrastructure and trade openness on Pakistan’s ecological footprint over the period 1970–2019 using the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model. The study results posit that positive and negative shocks to physical infrastructure increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically in the short-run and symmetrically in the long-run. Likewise, the positive and negative shocks to trade openness increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically, both in the short and in the long run. Furthermore, urbanization also positively and significantly increases Pakistan’s ecological footprint in the short and long run. Moreover, a 1% increase in physical infrastructure increases the ecological footprint by 0.32%, while a 1% decrease in physical infrastructure decreases the ecological footprint by 0.33% in the long run. Similarly, a 1% increase in trade openness causes a 0.09% increase in the ecological footprint in the long term, while a 1% reduction in trade openness causes a 0.61% reduction in the ecological footprint. The results also conclude that urbanization is a major determinant of Pakistan’s long-term ecological footprint. Thus, a 1% increase in urbanization causes a 1.31% increase in the ecological footprint in the long run. Finally, this study recommends that policies regarding physical infrastructure be formulated keeping in view its environmental impact. In addition, strict environmental policies should be implemented to reduce the environmental degradation effect of trade openness.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vxo0MJ

medical,"Wastewater surveillance for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging approach to help identify the risk of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, and nursing homes) scales. This paper explores the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation. We present the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resources, and impacts from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions. Our analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of local information needs, sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BU_ab-

medical,"Neural-interfaced prostheses aim to restore sensorimotor limb functions in amputees. They rely on bidirectional neural interfaces, which represent the communication bridge between nervous system and neuroprosthetic device by controlling its movements and evoking sensory feedback. Compared to extraneural electrodes (i.e., epineural and perineural implants), intraneural electrodes, implanted within peripheral nerves, have higher selectivity and specificity of neural signal recording and nerve stimulation. However, being implanted in the nerve, their main limitation is represented by the significant inflammatory response that the body mounts around the probe, known as Foreign Body Reaction (FBR), which may hinder their rapid clinical translation. Furthermore, the mechanical mismatch between the consistency of the device and the surrounding neural tissue may contribute to exacerbate the inflammatory state. The FBR is a non-specific reaction of the host immune system to a foreign material. It is characterized by an early inflammatory phase eventually leading to the formation of a fibrotic capsule around intraneural interfaces, which increases the electrical impedance over time and reduces the chronic interface biocompatibility and functionality. Thus, the future in the reduction and control of the FBR relies on innovative biomedical strategies for the fabrication of next-generation neural interfaces, such as the development of more suitable designs of the device with smaller size, appropriate stiffness and novel conductive and biomimetic coatings for improving their long-term stability and performance. Here, we present and critically discuss the latest biomedical approaches from material chemistry and tissue engineering for controlling and mitigating the FBR in chronic neural implants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PLTQz2

medical,"Avian influenza, or influenza A (H5N1), has 3 of the 4 properties necessary to cause a serious pandemic: It can infect people, nearly all people are immunologically naive, and it is highly lethal. The Achilles heel of the virus is the lack of sustained human-human transmission. Fortunately, among the 124 cases reported through 30 May 2006, nearly all were acquired by direct contact with poultry. Unfortunately, the capability for efficient human-human transmission requires only a single mutation by a virus that is notoriously genetically unstable, hence the need for a new vaccine each year for seasonal influenza. Influenza A (H5N1) is being compared to another avian strain, the agent of the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919, which traversed the world in 3 months and caused an estimated 50 million deaths. The question is, are we ready for this type of pandemic? The answer is probably no. The main problems are the lack of an effective vaccine, very poor surge capacity, a health care system that could not accommodate even a modest pandemic, and erratic regional planning.

medical,"This study investigates age and cultural differences in the negative effects of senders’ wearing masks on receivers’ readabilities of senders’ facially expressed emotions in interpersonal interactions. An online experiment was thus conducted with Koreans and Americans aged over 20 years. Based on sampling quotas by nationality, age group and gender, Korean (n = 240) and American (n = 273) participants were recruited from panel members of a Korean research company and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk via email and the website, respectively. The participants played receiver roles to infer senders’ facially expressed emotions presented in photos in the experiment. They judged emotions facially expressed by the senders without masks and with masks are shown in photos. The results revealed that the senders’ wearing masks reduced the readabilities of the senders’ facially expressed anger among participants aged 30–49 years more than among participants aged 20–29 years. The senders’ wearing masks decreased the readabilities of the senders’ facially expressed fear for participants in their 50’s more than for participants in their 20’s. When the senders wore masks, the readabilities of the senders’ facially expressed happiness dropped among participants aged over 60 years more than among participants aged 20–49 years.

medical," Kartagener syndrome Dextrocardia bronchiectasis and sinusitis Siewert syndrome Immotile cilia syndrome, Kartagener type Dextrocardia bronchiectasis and sinusitis Siewert syndrome Immotile cilia syndrome, Kartagener type Primary ciliary dyskinesia, Kartagener type Dextrocardia-bronchiectasis-sinusitis syndrome Primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus See More Summary Kartagener syndrome is a type of p that is also characterized by situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of internal organs ). The signs and symptoms vary but may include neonatal respiratory distress; frequent lung, sinus and middle ear infections beginning in early childhood; and infertility. [1] [2] [3] It can be cause by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although scientists have identified many of the genes associated with Kartagener syndrome, the genetic cause of some cases is unknown. [4] [2] There is no cure for Kartagener syndrome. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include airway clearance therapy and antibiotics . [1] [2] [3] Symptoms Kartagener syndrome is characterized by p and situs inversus totalis. In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body. Although the internal organs are abnormally placed, this condition typically does not cause any health problems. [1] [2] The signs and symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia vary, but may include: [1] [2] [3] Neonatal respiratory distress Frequent respiratory infections that can lead to severe lung damage Chronic nasal congestion Frequent sinus infections Recurrent middle ear infections, particularly in early childhood Hearing loss Hydrocephalus Infertility Cause Kartagener syndrome can be caused by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes . These genes encode proteins that are important to the structure and function of cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that are found on the surface of cells in various parts of the body such as the lining of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs . The coordinated movement of cilia in wave-like motions is important to the normal functioning of certain organs and tissues throughout the body and ensures the proper placement of organs in the developing embryo. Mutations in these genes cause the cilia to be either immotile (unable to move) or dysmotile (they move incorrectly), which leads to the many signs and symptoms of Kartagener syndrome. [1] [4] [3] Scientists have identified several different genes that are associated with Kartagener syndrome; however, the genetic cause is unknown in some cases. [1] [4] [3] Inheritance Kartagener syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell . The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Diagnosis Kartagener syndrome is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a small sample of tissue ( biopsy ) from an area of the body known to have cilia such as the sinus cavities or the airway. Abnormalities in the structure of cilia, as seen in people affected by Kartagener syndrome, can be observed under a special microscope (called an electron microscope). If the disease-causing change ( mutation ) is known, genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis. [1] [2] [3] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment There is currently no cure for Kartagener syndrome . Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Airway clearance therapy, similar to that used in cystic fibrosis, can loosen thick, sticky mucus so it can be cleared away. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat respiratory, sinus, and middle ear infections and may be given on a long-term basis in people with chronic or frequent infections. Surgery to insert ear tubes may be recommended in children with chronic ear infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In people with severe lung disease, lung transplantation may be an option. [1] [2] [3] For more information on the treatment and management of Kartagener syndrome, please click here. Prognosis The long-term outlook for people with Kartagener syndrome varies widely and largely depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Chronic childhood infections can be very debilitating. However, with appropriate treatment, the progression of lung disease can be slowed and other complications such as hearing loss can be avoided.

medical,"Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.

medical,"Background Limited prior data suggest that pre-existing liver disease was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. The association of FIB-4 with COVID-19 outcomes has not been previously evaluated. Methods FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. Results Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein). Conclusions FIB-4 at early-stage of COVID-19 disease had an independent and dose-dependent association with adverse outcomes during hospitalization.

medical,"In recent years, probiotics have attracted public attention and transformed the social perception of microorganisms, convening a beneficial role/state on human health. With aging, the immune system, body physiology, and intestinal microbiota tend to change unfavorably, resulting in many chronic conditions. The immune-mediated disorders can be linked to intestinal dysbiosis, consequently leading to immune dysfunctions and a cluster of conditions such as asthma, autoimmune diseases, eczema, and various allergies. Probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are considered probiotic species that have a great immunomodulatory and anti-allergic effect. Moreover, recent scientific and clinical data illustrate that probiotics can regulate the immune system, exert anti-viral and anti-tumoral activity, and shields the host against oxidative stress. Additionally, microbiota programming by probiotic bacteria can reduce and prevent the symptoms of respiratory infections and ameliorate the neurological status in humans. This review describes the most recent clinical findings, including safe probiotic therapies aiming to medicate respiratory infections, allergies, cancer, and neurological disorders due to their physiological interconnection.

Areas affected would be feet, legs, groin area, hands, arms, back of neck. It looks like an infection since it is red, swollen, sore but no opening in the skin. I think it may be an auto- immune problem. I ve had this now since I was 30 yr. old and am now 58 yr. old. I thought perhaps it could be Sarcoidosis, however chest x-rays do not show abnormal lesions which is usually found with this disease. Sarcoidosis is however difficult to diagnose. Doctors do not seem overly concerned, but if it is Sarcoidosis, that is something that I understand from some sources can be treated with steroidal type medicine. Or it could be something like Sarcoidosis. I would like to get rid of it permanently even though it manifests itself occasionally. First time I got it, it came on suddenly and affected from the knees down. Red slash marks about 1.5 to 2 inches long by about .5 inch wide turned bluish like a bruise and was raised, warm to the touch and painful but denser in the centre. It went away on its own but took a few months. My feet were both very swollen. I get it periodically, seemingly when I m physically and mentally stressed.

medical,"Taste disorders, impacting well-being and physical health, can be caused by many etiologies including the use of medication. Recently, taste disturbance is also considered as one of the predominant symptoms of COVID-19 although its pathogenesis requires further research. Localized taste disorders may be overlooked considering that whole-mouth taste perception is insured through several mechanisms. Individuals often fail to discern taste from flavor, and interviews/surveys are insufficient to properly assess taste function. Hence, various taste assessment methods have been developed. Among them, psychophysical methods are most widely applied in a clinical context. Less-biased electrophysiological, imaging, or morphological methods are used to a much lesser degree.

medical,"This study aims to investigate the effects of threonine (Thr) on immunoregulation in vivo and in vitro of teleost grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Juveniles (9.53 ± 0.02 g) were reared for 8 weeks with respective Thr diet (3.99, 7.70, 10.72, 14.10, 17.96, and 21.66 g/kg) and then challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila for in vivo study. Macrophages isolated from head kidney were treated in vitro for 48 h with L-Thr (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mM) after 6 h of lipopolysaccharide induction. The results showed that, compared with Thr deficiency (3.99 g/kg), the optimal dietary Thr (14.10g/kg) affected the immunocyte activation in the head kidney (HK) and spleen (SP) by downregulating the mRNA expressions of MHC-II and upregulating CD4 (not CD8), and it mediated the innate immune by enhancing the activities of lysozyme (LZ), acid phosphatase content of complement 3 (C3) and C4, increasing the mRNA abundances of hepcidin, liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-2A (LEAP-2A), LEAP-2B, β-defensin1, downregulating tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-17AF1, and IL-17D partly by attenuating RORγ1 transcriptional factor and nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κBp65) signaling cascades [IKKβ/IκBα/NF-κBp65] and upregulating transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), IL-4/13A, -4/13B, IL-10, and IL-22 partly by GATA-3. Besides these, the optimal dietary Thr regulated the adaptive immune by upregulating the mRNAs of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgZ (not IgD). Moreover, 2 mM Thr downregulated in vitro the mRNA abundances of colony stimulating factor-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, mannose receptor 1, matrix metalloproteinase2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 significantly (P < 0.05), indicating that Thr could attenuate the M1-type macrophages’ activation. Moreover, L-Thr downregulated the mRNA transcripts of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β associated with impairing the SOCS1/STAT1 signaling and upregulated IL-10 and TGF-β1 partly by accentuating the SOCS3/STAT3 pathway. The above-mentioned observations suggested that Thr improved the immune status in the immune organs of fish by enhancing the immune defense and mediating the inflammation process. Finally, based on the immune indices of LZ activity in HK and C3 content in SP, the optimal Thr for immune enhancement in juvenile grass carp (9.53–53.43 g) was determined to be 15.70 g/kg diet (4.85 g/100 g protein) and 14.49 g/kg diet (4.47 g/100 g protein), respectively.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jFckdk

medical,"OBJECTIVE Interhospital transport (IHT) is common among critically ill patients. Our meta-analysis investigated the prevalence and possible factors associated with adverse events (AEs) during IHT. METHODS Searching PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases until February 12, 2021, we included studies that a priori defined AEs for adult medical patients. We excluded case reports, non-full-text, and non-English language studies. We performed a random effects meta-analysis and moderator analyses. RESULTS We identified 554 studies and included 19 studies (14,969 patients) in our final analysis. The mean patients' (standard deviation) age was 60 (13.7). The pooled medical AEs for IHT was 1,059 (11%, 95% confidence interval, 7.5%-16%). The most common AE (n, %) was hypotension (424, 2.8%). Moderator analyses and meta-regressions suggested that conditions (P < .001) such as respiratory failure from coronavirus infection (88%), stroke (19%), and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (40%) were associated with higher AE prevalence. Transport by nurses (31%) and physicians (11%) was associated with a higher AE prevalence, whereas transport type did not influence AE prevalence. CONCLUSION Our study suggests the prevalence of AEs of critically ill patients during IHT is low and likely due to patients' disease severity. Further studies should focus on interventions to mitigate AEs to improve patients' outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",S88TXH

medical,"BACKGROUND: Surgical smoke is a well-recognized hazard in the operating room. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol. This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications. RESULTS: Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50. Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy. SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol. CONCLUSION: If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

medical,"Multimedia IoT (M-IoT) is an emerging type of Internet of things (IoT) relaying multimedia data (images, videos, audio and speech, etc.). The rapid growth of M-IoT devices enables the creation of a massive volume of multimedia data with different characteristics and requirements. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based multimedia IoT systems have been recently designed and deployed for various video-based services for contemporary daily life, like video surveillance with high definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) and mobile multimedia streaming. These new services need higher video quality in order to meet the quality of experience (QoE) required by the users. Versatile video coding (VVC) is the new video coding standard that achieves significant coding efficiency over its predecessor high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). Moreover, VVC can achieve up to 30% BD rate savings compared to HEVC. Inspired by the rapid advancements in deep learning, we propose in this paper a wide-activated squeeze-and-excitation deep convolutional neural network (WSE-DCNN) technique-based video quality enhancement for VVC. Therefore, we replace the conventional in-loop filtering in VVC by the proposed WSE-DCNN model that eliminates the compression artifacts in order to improve visual quality and hence increase the end user QoE. The obtained results prove that the proposed in-loop filtering technique achieves [Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%, and [Formula: see text]% BD rate reduction for luma and both chroma components under random access configuration. Compared to the traditional CNN-based filtering approaches, the proposed WSE-DCNN-based in-loop filtering framework achieves efficient performance in terms of RD cost.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jnGSoH

medical,"Introduction: Good Infection prevention and control (IPC) is vital for tackling antimicrobial resistance and limiting health care-associated infections. We compared IPC performance before (2019) and during the COVID-19 (2021) era at the national IPC unit and all regional (4) and district hospitals (8) in Sierra Leone. Methods: Cross-sectional assessments using standardized World Health Organizations IPC checklists. IPC performance scores were graded as inadequate = 0–25%, basic = 25.1–50%, intermediate = 50.1–75%, and advanced = 75.1–100%. Results: Overall performance improved from ‘basic’ to ‘intermediate’ at the national IPC unit (41% in 2019 to 58% in 2021) and at regional hospitals (37% in 2019 to 54% in 2021) but remained ‘basic’ at district hospitals (37% in 2019 to 50% in 2021). Priority gaps at the national IPC unit included lack of: a dedicated IPC budget, monitoring the effectiveness of IPC trainings and health care-associated infection surveillance. Gaps at hospitals included no assessment of hospital staffing needs, inadequate infrastructure for IPC and lack of a well-defined monitoring plan with clear goals, targets and activities. Conclusion: Although there is encouraging progress in IPC performance, it is slower than desired in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

medical,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a fatty acid binding site, also found in some other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV), which binds linoleic acid and is functionally important. When occupied by linoleic acid, it reduces infectivity, by locking the spike in a less infectious conformation. Here, we use dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to compare the response of spike variants to linoleic acid removal. These simulations show that the fatty acid site is coupled to functional regions of the protein, some of them far from the site (e.g. in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, the furin cleavage site located in position 679-685 and the fusion peptide-surrounding regions) and identify the allosteric networks involved in these connections. Comparison of the response of the original ( Wuhan) spike with four variants: Alpha, Delta, Delta plus and Omicron BA.1 show that the variants differ significantly in their response to linoleic acid removal. The allosteric connections to the fatty acid site on Alpha are generally similar to the original protein, except for the receptor-binding motif and S71-R78 region which show a weaker link to the FA site. In contrast, Omicron is the most affected variant exhibiting significant differences in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, V622-L629 and the furin cleavage site. These differences in allosteric modulation may be of functional relevance, e.g. in differences in transmissibility and virulence.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The recent surge in clinical and nonclinical health-related data has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in personal health data (PHD) research across multiple disciplines such as medicine, computer science, and management. There is now a need to synthesize the dynamic knowledge of PHD in various disciplines to spot potential research hotspots. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to reveal the knowledge evolutionary trends in PHD and detect potential research hotspots using bibliometric analysis. METHODS: We collected 8281 articles published between 2009 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. The knowledge evolution analysis (KEA) framework was used to analyze the evolution of PHD research. The KEA framework is a bibliometric approach that is based on 3 knowledge networks: reference co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, and discipline co-occurrence. RESULTS: The findings show that the focus of PHD research has evolved from medicine centric to technology centric to human centric since 2009. The most active PHD knowledge cluster is developing knowledge resources and allocating scarce resources. The field of computer science, especially the topic of artificial intelligence (AI), has been the focal point of recent empirical studies on PHD. Topics related to psychology and human factors (eg, attitude, satisfaction, education) are also receiving more attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that PHD research has the potential to provide value-based health care in the future. All stakeholders should be educated about AI technology to promote value generation through PHD. Moreover, technology developers and health care institutions should consider human factors to facilitate the effective adoption of PHD-related technology. These findings indicate opportunities for interdisciplinary cooperation in several PHD research areas: (1) AI applications for PHD; (2) regulatory issues and governance of PHD; (3) education of all stakeholders about AI technology; and (4) value-based health care including “allocative value,” “technology value,” and “personalized value.”",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",iVqooq
medical,"The local outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a global pandemic in a short time have made health literacy more critical than ever in facing these global health threats. The main objective of the research is to know the reflection of the strategic theory in health literacy and the relationship and impact statement, and then it is possible to know the determinants of the health institution’s success in managing health literacy efforts as the Department of Health of Najaf was the organization in question. The researcher surveyed the opinions of a number of its employees, as the research community was (248) employees, and the research sample reached (155) responses on which the analysis can be performed. A set of specialized descriptive and inferential tests and methods were conducted on the data obtained by using (SPSS v.26) program. The results show that the health institution’s interest in strategic theory will contribute to achieving health literacy by demonstrating the relationship and impact between the two research variables. The research extracts a set of recommendations, the most important of which is to increase the interest of the departments in the Najaf Health Department in the concept of strategic theory and make health literacy programs a priority that must be implemented even in light of the scarcity of financial resources.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xyY3db

medical,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have been attributed to the occurrence of secondary and tertiary COVID-19 epidemic waves and also threatening vaccine efforts due to their immune invasiveness. Since the importation of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa, with the first reported COVID-19 case on the 5th of March 2020, South Africa has observed 3 consecutive COVID-19 epidemic waves. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has played a significant role in the resurgence of COVID-19 epidemic waves in South Africa and across the globe. South Africa has a unique observation of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages dominating certain epidemic periods. This unique observation allows for an investigation of the detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages' impact on COVID-19 transmissibility and severity through analysis of epidemiological data. In this study, inferential statistical analysis was conducted on South African COVID-19 epidemiological data to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the South African COVID-19 epidemiology. The general methodology in this study involved the collation of South African COVID-19 epidemiological data, the regression and normalisation of the epidemiological data, and inferential statistical analysis. This study shows that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in an increase in COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in South Africa. The Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in increased COVID-19 transmissibility in the South African population by 53.9 to 54.8 % more than the Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOC and the predominantly B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 C.1 SA SARS-CoV-2 lineage cluster. The Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in more severe COVID-19 in South Africa than the Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC. While, both the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in more severe COVID-19 than the initial SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in the South African first epidemic wave period. The Delta, Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and the predominantly B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 C.1 SA SARS-CoV-2 lineage cluster were observed to cause similar COVID-19 hospital case fatality and discharge rates in South African hospitals.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Jb_bq-

RESULTS Many families (66.3%) have seen their level of stress increased during lockdown because of, among other reasons, a greater burden of care. Difficulties were associated with the closure and changes in disability-related services. Families of people with extensive support needs have generally experienced greater difficulties. CONCLUSION Support services should have been considered essential services during lockdown.

As there is no prior study available, we evaluated these mental health outcomes and associated factors among the general population and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Bangladesh. This nationwide cross-sectional study comprised 3388 individuals including 834 HCPs. The measures included socio-demographics, healthcare, and patient-care related information, the Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Just over one-quarter of the participants were depressed, and was significantly associated with COVID-19 fear. Regression analyses showed that, both in general population and HCPs, depression and fear of COVID-19 were strongly predicted by being female; however, depression was inversely associated with being married. Particularly, among the HCPs, being restless while examining a patient with flu-like symptoms and while examining a patient returning from abroad was found to be significant predictor for both depression and fear of COVID-19. HCPs who were using single protective equipment for a week had greater depression and those who felt insecure due to the pandemic had a high level of COVID-19 fear. The findings identified major psychological impacts among the participants, suggesting the urgent need to promote mental wellbeing in both general population and medical professionals.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Qfozuj

medical,"A previously developed mechanistic model of COVID-19 transmission has been adapted and applied here to study the evolution of the disease and the effect of intervention measures in some European countries and territories where the disease had major impact. A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (Rt) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the afterwards reproduction number from current study.

medical,"Vaccination is considered the best strategy for limiting and eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of this strategy relies on the rate of vaccine deployment and acceptance across the globe. As these efforts are being conducted, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is continuously mutating, which leads to the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility, virulence, and lower response the vaccines. One important question is whether surveillance testing is still needed in order to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in an increasingly vaccinated population. In this study, we developed a multi-scale mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a vaccinated population and used it to predict the role of testing in an outbreak with alpha and delta variants. We found that, when the alpha variant is dominant, testing is effective when vaccination levels are low to moderate and its impact is diminished when vaccination levels are high. When the delta variant is dominant, widespread vaccination is necessary in order to prevent significant outbreaks. When only moderate vaccination can be achieved, frequent testing can significantly reduce the cumulative size of delta variant outbreak, with the impact of testing having maximum effects when focused on the non-vaccinated population.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9Q_IQW

We update the research priorities for childhood pneumonia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and explore whether previous priorities have been addressed. METHODS: We conducted an eDelphi study from November 2019 to June 2021. Experts were invited to take part, targeting balance by: gender, profession, and high (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We followed a three-stage approach: 1. Collating questions, using a list published in 2011 and adding newly posed topics; 2. Narrowing down, through participant scoring on importance and whether they had been answered; 3. Ranking of retained topics. Topics were categorized into: prevent and protect, diagnosis, treatment and cross-cutting. RESULTS: Overall 379 experts were identified, and 108 took part. We started with 83 topics, and 81 further general and 40 COVID-19 specific topics were proposed. In the final ranking 101 topics were retained, and the highest ranked was to “explore interventions to prevent neonatal pneumonia”. Among the top 20 topics, epidemiological research and intervention evaluation was commonly prioritized, followed by the operational and implementation research. Two COVID-19 related questions were ranked within the top 20. There were clear differences in priorities between HIC and LMIC respondents, and academics vs non-academics. CONCLUSIONS: Operational research on health system capacities, and evaluating optimized delivery of existing treatments, diagnostics and case management approaches are needed. This list should act as a catalyst for collaborative research, especially to meet the top priority in preventing neonatal pneumonia, and encourage multi-disciplinary partnerships.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7NGwtF

medical," Polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS Summary Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that can affect a woman's menstrual cycle, ability to have children, hormones , heart, blood vessels, and appearance. Women with this condition typically have high levels of hormones called androgens, missed or irregular periods, and many small cysts in their ovaries. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but probably involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Treatment for PCOS may involve birth control pills and medications for diabetes and infertility. Medicines called anti-androgens are also used to speed the growth of hair and clear acne.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand Canadian pharmacists’ use, experiences, and perspectives of telepharmacy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were currently a registered, licensed pharmacist practicing in Canada. We collected perspectives of both telepharmacy users and non-users by creating a survey logic that asked specific and shared questions between the two groups. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. RESULTS: Between October and December 2020, 136 pharmacists completed the survey, including 61 (52.6%) telepharmacy users and 55 (47.4%) non-users. Among those who use telepharmacy, the majority of participants (39, 72.2%) expressed that telepharmacy augmented their clinical practice and feel comfortable managing minor ailments using telepharmacy (41, 80.4%). Among non-users, 45 (84.9%) indicated that telepharmacy will augment their clinical practice and 48 (90.6%) would feel comfortable managing minor ailments using telepharmacy. Important considerations for successful implementation of telepharmacy for those who use telepharmacy included easier system implementation (29, 19.3%), better privacy & data protection (28, 18.7%) and simple to learn technology (23, 15.3%). CONCLUSION: Despite the growing recognition of benefits of telepharmacy, our findings suggest that utilization among pharmacists in Canada is still quite low. Nonetheless, our study identified areas of consideration for better integration of telepharmacy in pharmacy practice including optimizing workflow, addressing barriers, and providing training to pharmacy students.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xsMzQ-

medical,"Background: The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) is a commonly used self-reporting questionnaire used to measure adult attachment styles. The RQ has two parts. RQ1, a single item where individuals have to indicate their preferred relationship style, and RQ2, where individuals can rate their relationship style in more detail using four different scales. Agreement is expected between the highest levels selected and the style chosen in RQ1. An advantage of the RQ is its brevity, whereas a disadvantage is that it constitutes a single item. A validation of RQ has not been clearly demonstrated, even though it has convergent validity in relation to other measurements in this area. Methods: 168 patients completed the RQ, the short version of the Experience in Close Relationships (Revised) questionnaire (ECR-R), and scales of depression and interpersonal problems. Regression analysis was conducted to examine the congruity in regard to attachment theory. Results: ratings from 15.5% of the patients showed disagreement between RQ1 and RQ2. Each type of attachment measured by the RQ was predicted by the ECR-R scores, as hypothesized. In the predictive analysis of depression and interpersonal problems, both RQ dimensions and ECR-R scores were coherent. Conclusions: RQ is a valid self-reported measurement that can be applied clinically on the condition that the rater identifies an agreement between RQ1 and RQ2.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",o5vx8b

medical,"OBJECTIVE: A first protective dose of vaccine may allow delaying the second dose in a context of low supply. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. METHODS: A case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2;those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. RESULTS: 268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). CONCLUSIONS: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers early protection after twelve days of administration. These data could be considered to adapt strategies and consider postponing the second dose in situations of limited vaccine supply in order to achieve the maximum number of people covered with a first dose.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",SovL-i

medical,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate esophageal dysmotility (ED) and the extent of Barrett's esophagus (BE) before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) in patients previously diagnosed with BE and ED. METHODS: twenty-two patients with BE diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with biopsies and ED diagnosed by conventional esophageal manometry (CEM) were submitted to a LNF, and followed up with clinical evaluations, upper GI endoscopy with biopsies and CEM, for a minimum of 12 months after the surgical procedure. RESULTS: : sixteen patients were male (72.7%) and six were females (27.3%). The mean age was 55.14 (± 15.52) years old. and the mean postoperative follow-up was 26.2 months. The upper GI endoscopy showed that the mean length of BE was 4.09 cm preoperatively and 3.91cm postoperatively (p=0.042). The evaluation of esophageal dysmotility through conventional manometry showed that: the preoperative median of the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure (LESRP) was 9.15 mmHg and 13.2 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.006). The preoperative median of the esophageal contraction amplitude was 47.85 mmHg, and 57.50 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.408). Preoperative evaluation of esophageal peristalsis showed that 13.6% of the sample presented diffuse esophageal spasm and 9.1% ineffective esophageal motility. In the postoperative, 4.5% of patients had diffuse esophageal spasm, 13.6% of aperistalsis and 22.7% of ineffective motor activity (p=0.133). CONCLUSION: LNF decreased the BE extension, increased the LES resting pressure, and increased the amplitude of the distal esophageal contraction; however, it was unable to improve ED.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Ajro0G

Although disease manifestations are infrequent, the virus is still present in pig herds, causing sporadic outbreaks in a milder form. Identification and characterisation of the spike genes from TGEV and PRCoV, detected in such outbreaks, were performed in Hungary. Analysis of the amplified partial gene sequences showed that TGEV was present in herds with TGE clinical signs together with PRCoV.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease. The spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease have led to the widespread adoption of social distancing measures. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission have been applied at all social levels, including health care operators. Hence, this reports focuses on the description of a new protocol for the safe management of cytological samples processed by liquid-based cytology (LBC) with an evaluation of the changes in terms of morphology and immunoreactivity. METHODS: From March 11 to April 25, 2020, 414 cytological cases suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 were processed with a new virus-inactivating method suggested by Hologic, Inc, for all LBC specimens. RESULTS: The samples showed an increased amount of fibrin in the background. A slight decrease in cellular size was also observed in comparison with the standard method of preparation. Nonetheless, the nuclear details of the neoplastic cells were well identified, and the immunoreactivity of the majority of those cells was maintained. The cell blocks did not show significant differences in morphology, immunoreactivity, or nucleic acid stability. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some minor changes in the morphology of the cells, the results of this study highlight that the adoption of the new protocol for the biosafety of LBC-processed samples in pathology laboratories is important for minimizing the risk for personnel, trainees, and cytopathologists without impairing the diagnostic efficacy of the technique.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",AKzwQb

medical,"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent COVID-19, one of the most impactful health crises afflicting humanity in recent decades. While research advances have yielded several treatment and prevention options, the pandemic is slow to abate, necessitating an expansion of our treatment arsenal. As a member of the coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 contains several ion channels, of which E and 3a are the best characterized. Since ion channels as a family are excellent drug targets, we sought to inhibit both viroporins as a means to curb infectivity. In a previous targeted study, we identified several blockers to each channel from an extensive drug repurposing library. Herein, we examined the ability of said compounds on the whole virus in cellulo. Gratifyingly, many of the blockers exhibited antiviral activity in a stringent assay examining protection from viral-driven death. In particular, darapladib and flumatinib, both 3a blockers, displayed potent antiviral activity. Furthermore, appreciable synergism between flumatinib and several E blockers was identified in a concentration regime in which the compounds are present in human plasma following oral administration. Taken together, targeting ion channels represents a promising approach to both augment and complement our antiviral arsenal against COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",NgXXNI
medical,"BACKGROUND: Gelatinous zooplankton can be difficult to preserve morphologically due to unique physical properties of their cellular and acellular components. The relatively large volume of mesoglea leads to distortion of the delicate morphology and poor sample integrity in specimens prepared with standard aldehyde or alcohol fixation techniques. Similar challenges have made it difficult to extend standard laboratory methods such as in situ hybridization to larger juvenile ctenophores, hampering studies of late development. RESULTS: We have found that a household water repellant glass treatment product commonly used in laboratories, Rain-X®, alone or in combination with standard aldehyde fixatives, greatly improves morphological preservation of such delicate samples. We present detailed methods for preservation of ctenophores of diverse sizes compatible with long-term storage or detection and localization of target molecules such as with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and show that this fixation might be broadly useful for preservation of other delicate marine specimens. CONCLUSION: This new method will enable superior preservation of morphology in gelatinous specimens for a variety of downstream goals. Extending this method may improve the morphological fidelity and durability of museum and laboratory specimens for other delicate sample types.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: Despite huge global, national, and local preventive measures including travel restriction, social distancing, and quarantines, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develops the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. STUDY DESIGN: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. METHODS: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively). Analysis by the statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of patients to contract COVID-19 is less in warmer countries than in colder countries. CONCLUSION: This pilot study proposes that cold environment may be an additional risk factor for COVID-19 cases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FBo7G-

Therefore, this qualitative study was conducted to examine and explain these social consequences and their impact on the social capital of Iran during the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a content analysis approach, nine experts participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Lundman and Graneheim's method. The social impacts of COVID-19 can be summarized into six categories and 32 subcategories. Three positive-negative categories emerged from the data analysis: ""formation of new patterns of social communications;formation of new patterns of behavior;creation of economic changes."" Three entirely negative categories included ""creating a climate of distrust;disruption of cultural, social, and religious values;psychosocial disorders."" Overall, most findings (27 out of 32 subcategories) indicated the destructive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social capital. Therefore, this raises concerns about social capital endangerment in Iran.

medical,"Background/Objectives: Visual field loss is frequent in patients with brain tumors, worsening their daily life and exacerbating the burden of disease, and no supportive care strategies exist. In this case series, we sought to characterize the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a home-based visual rehabilitation program in hemianopia patients using immersive virtual-reality stimulation. Subjects/Methods: Two patients, one with homonymous hemianopia and the other with bitemporal hemianopia, consecutive to pediatric brain tumors, with no prior visual rehabilitation performed 15 min of home-based audiovisual stimulation every 2 days for 6 weeks (case 2) and 7 weeks (case 1) between February and August 2020. Patients used a virtual-reality, stand-alone, and remotely controlled device loaded with a non-commercial audiovisual stimulation program managed in real time from the laboratory. Standard visual outcomes assessed in usual care in visual rehabilitation were measured at the clinic. Following a mixed method approach in this pragmatic study of two cases, we collected quantitative and qualitative data on feasibility and potential effectiveness and compared the results pre- and post-treatment. Results: Implementation and wireless delivery of the audiovisual stimulation, remote data collection, and analysis for cases 1 and 2 who completed 19/20 and 20/20 audiovisual stimulation sessions at home, respectively, altogether indicated feasibility. Contrast sensitivity increased in both eyes for cases 1 and 2. Visual fields, measured by binocular Esterman and monocular Humphrey full-field analyses, improved in case 1. A minor increase was observed in case 2. Cases 1 and 2 enhanced reading speed. Case 2 strongly improved quality of life scores. Conclusion: This is the first report of a home-based virtual-reality visual rehabilitation program for adult patients with hemianopia consecutive to a pediatric brain tumor.

medical,"Background: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible infectious disease that has infected over 122 million individuals worldwide. To combat this pandemic, governments around the world have imposed lockdowns. However, the impact of these lockdowns on the rates of COVID-19 transmission in communities is not well known. Here, we used COVID-19 case counts from 3,000+ counties in the United States (US) to determine the relationship between lockdown as well as other county factors and the rate of COVID-19 spread in these communities. Methods: We merged county-specific COVID-19 case counts with US census data and the date of lockdown for each of the counties. We then applied a Functional Principal Component (FPC) analysis on this dataset to generate scores that described the trajectory of COVID-19 spread across the counties. We used machine learning methods to identify important factors in the county including the date of lockdown that significantly influenced the FPC scores. Findings: We found that the first FPC score accounted for up to 92.81% of the variations in the absolute rates of COVID-19 as well as the topology of COVID-19 spread over time at a county level. The relation between incidence of COVID-19 and time at a county level demonstrated a hockey-stick appearance with an inflection point approximately 7 days prior to the county reporting at least 5 new cases of COVID-19; beyond this inflection point, there was an exponential increase in incidence. Among the risk factors, lockdown and total population were the two most significant features of the county that influenced the rate of COVID-19 infection, while the median family income, median age and within-county move also substantially affect COVID spread. Interpretation: Lockdowns are an effective way of controlling the COVID-19 spread in communities. However, significant delays in lockdown cause a dramatic increase in the case counts. Thus, the timing of the lockdown relative to the case count is an important consideration in controlling the pandemic in communities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GkmKBc

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 2579 patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified between March 22 and June 3, 2020 from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD. Among the subset of patients who benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluations, there were 75 anosmic, 43 hyposmic and 113 normosmic patients. The prevalence of anosmia significantly decreased with the severity of the disease. Anosmia or hyposmia were not associated with any nasal disorder, according to SNOT-22.

medical,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hypertension, and multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antivirals with safe clinical profile are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. In an analysis of a randomly collected cohort of 124 patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), we found that hypercoagulability as indicated by elevated concentrations of D-dimers was associated with disease severity. By virtual screening of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, we identified an anticoagulation agent dipyridamole (DIP) in silico, which suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In a proof-of-concept trial involving 31 patients with COVID-19, DIP supplementation was associated with significantly decreased concentrations of D-dimers (P<0.05), increased lymphocyte and platelet recovery in the circulation, and markedly improved clinical outcomes in comparison to the control patients. In particular, all 8 of the DIP-treated severely ill patients showed remarkable improvement: 7 patients (87.5%) achieved clinical cure and were discharged from the hospitals while the remaining 1 patient (12.5%) was in clinical remission.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8R1xiU
medical,"BACKGROUND Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in young adults with obesity. Obesity is associated with relative growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and data from animal studies and from humans with pituitary GH deficiency suggest a role for GH deficiency in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The effects of GH on NAFLD in those with obesity are unknown, however, prompting this pilot study to assess effects of GH administration on measures of NAFLD in young adults. METHODS Twenty-four men and women aged 18-29 years with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 , hepatic fat fraction (HFF) ≥ 5% on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) z-score ≤ 0 were randomized to treatment with recombinant human GH (rhGH) versus no treatment for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in HFF. RESULTS Compared to no treatment, the effect size of rhGH on absolute HFF over 24 weeks was -3.3% (95% confidence interval: -7.8%, 1.2%; p = .14). At 24 weeks, HFF < 5% was achieved in 5 of 9 individuals receiving rhGH versus 1 of 9 individuals receiving no treatment (p = .04). rhGH did not significantly reduce ALT, AST or GGT. Serum IGF-1 increased as expected with rhGH treatment, and there were no changes in fasting lipids, C-reactive protein, fasting glucose or 2-h glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test. CONCLUSION Data from this pilot study suggest that rhGH treatment in young adults with obesity and NAFLD may have benefits to reduce liver fat content, although larger studies are needed to confirm this effect.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gyyx89

medical,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an ATP-gated chloride channel expressed on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells. CFTR absence/dysfunction results in defective ion transport and subsequent airway surface liquid dehydration that severely compromise the airway microenvironment. Noxious agents and pathogens are entrapped inside the abnormally thick mucus layer and establish a highly inflammatory environment, ultimately leading to lung damage. Since chronic airway inflammation plays a crucial role in CF pathophysiology, several studies have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the altered inflammatory/immune response that, in turn, exacerbates the epithelial dysfunction and infection susceptibility in CF patients. In this review, we address the evidence for a critical role of dysfunctional inflammation in lung damage in CF and discuss current therapeutic approaches targeting this condition, as well as potential new treatments that have been developed recently. Traditional therapeutic strategies have shown several limitations and limited clinical benefits. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop alternative treatments and novel therapeutic approaches, and recent findings have identified new molecules as potential anti-inflammatory agents that may exert beneficial effects in CF patients. Furthermore, the potential anti-inflammatory properties of CFTR modulators, a class of drugs that directly target the molecular defect of CF, also will be critically reviewed. Finally, we also will discuss the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CF patients, with a major focus on the consequences that the viral infection could have on the persistent inflammation in these patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",kcms-z

medical,"OBJECTIVE: To identify preinfection risk factors for adverse outcomes among veterans with diabetes and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified all Veterans Health Administration patients with diabetes and one or more positive nasal swab(s) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (1 March 2020–10 March 2021) (n = 64,892). We examined associations of HbA(1c) and glucose-lowering medication use with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality at 30 days using logistic regression models and during 4.4 months of follow-up (range <1–13.1) using proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Compared with HbA(1c) <7.0%, HbA(1c) ≥9.0% was associated with higher odds of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death at 30 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.27 [95% CI 1.19–1.35], 1.28 [95% CI 1.15–1.42], 1.30 [95% CI 1.17–1.44], respectively) as well as higher risk of death over 4.4 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22 [95% CI 1.12–1.32]). Insulin use was associated with higher odds of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.07–1.18], 1.12 [95% CI 1.04–1.22], and 1.18 [95% CI 1.09–1.27], respectively) and higher risk of death (HR 1.12 [95% CI 1.07–1.18]). Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA), or angiotensin receptor blocker use were associated with lower odds of hospitalization (OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.85–0.99], 0.88 [95% CI 0.81–0.96], and 0.94 [95% CI 0.89–0.99], respectively). Metformin and SGLT2i use were associated with lower odds (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.78–0.91], 0.82 [95% CI 0.72–0.94], respectively) and risk of death (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.79–0.89], 0.82 [95% CI 0.74–0.92], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among veterans with diabetes and COVID-19, higher HbA(1c) and insulin use were directly associated with adverse outcomes, while use of a GLP1-RA, metformin, and SGLT2i was inversely associated.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2Uq7SY

medical,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical trial data for the efficacy of glucosamine in OA are conflicting. Reportedly, Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products are more likely to be effective, and a possible explanation is greater bioavailability than other brands. Specifically, the aim was to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Rotta- and non-Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products in healthy volunteers and examine the interindividual variability. METHODS: In a crossover design, healthy adult participants ingested 1500 mg/day of a Rotta (DONA powder sachets; imported by Mylan Health, Carole Park, QLD, Australia) and a non-Rotta (glucosamine sulphate 1500 mg one-a-day tablet; Blackmores, Warriewood, NSW, Australia) glucosamine product/brand individually for 6 days. Blood samples were collected immediately before and for 12 h after the ingestion of the last dose of each brand and analysed to determine plasma levels of glucosamine. The pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state [including the minimum (Css min) and maximum (Css max) plasma concentration of glucosamine, time to reach Css max post-dosing (Tss max) and area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUCss 0-12)] for each brand were calculated and statistically compared. RESULTS: Fourteen participants [mean age 35.5 years (s.d. 8.8)] were recruited (64.2% males). No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the two brands. However, for both brands, the coefficient of variation for Css min, Tss max and AUCss 0-12 exceeded 20%, indicating considerable differences in the parameters between participants. No significant association of the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with various dosing- and participant-related variables. CONCLUSION: Substantial interindividual differences in the absorption and elimination of glucosamine could be a cause of variable clinical outcomes in OA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12618000699268p.aspx), number ACTRN12618000699268p.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zBikiW
medical,"Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) is produced in large quantities and widely used in a number of countries worldwide to stimulate milk production in dairy animals. The use of this compound in animal production is strictly regulated by food safety directives in force, in particular in the European Union (EU). Although analytical strategies for the detection of rbGH in blood have been successfully reported over the past 15 years, they do not fully answer the expectations of either competent authorities or industrials that would expect measuring its occurrence directly in the milk. As a matrix of excretion but also of consumption, milk appears indeed as the matrix of choice for detecting the use of rbGH in dairy animals. It also allows large volumes to be collected without presenting an invasive character for the animal. However, rbGH detection in milk presents several challenges, mainly related to the sensitivity required for its detection in a complex biological matrix. This review article presents the specific difficulties associated with milk and provides an overview of the analytical strategies reported in the literature and whether they concern indirect or direct approaches to the detection of rbGH administration to animals, with applications either for screening or confirmation purposes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",40RKgX

Traditional anti-spam gateway commonly requires to maintain a greylist to filter out unexpected emails based on suspicious vocabularies existed in the mail subject and content. However, the signature-based approach cannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize various hot topics at present, such as COVID-19 and US election. To address the problem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight semantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each event log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract interesting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations, we claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between senders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources, which can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the performance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends and receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a high detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain a low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UbAKC0

medical,"Ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers could directly probe the existence of ultralight dark matter ($\mathcal{O}(10^{-14}-10^{-11})$ eV/$c^2$) that couples to standard-model particles in the detectors. Recently, many techniques have been developed to extract a variety of potential dark-matter signals from noisy gravitational-wave data; however, little effort has gone into ways to distinguish between types of dark matter that could directly interact with the interferometers. In this work, we employ the Wiener filter to follow-up candidate dark-matter interaction signals. The filter captures the stochastic nature of these signals, and, in simulations, successfully identifies which type of dark matter interacts with the interferometers.

Systematic studies of occupational risks for COVID-19 in the context of community risks are difficult and have only recently started to be reported. Ongoing quality improvement studies in various locales and within many affected healthcare institutions are needed. A template design for small-scale quality improvement surveys is proposed. Such surveys have the potential for rapid implementation and completion, are cost-effective, impose little administrative or workforce burden, can reveal occupational risks while taking community risks into account, and can be repeated easily with short time intervals between repetitions. This article describes a template design and proposes a survey instrument that is easily modifiable to fit the particular needs of various healthcare institutions in the hope of beginning a collaborative effort to refine the design and instrument. These methods, along with data management and analytic techniques, can be widely useful and shared globally.

medical,"Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) replicates the host cell's genome by interacting with the host proteins. Due to this fact, the identification of virus and host protein-protein interactions could be beneficial in understanding the disease transmission behavior of the virus as well as in potential COVID-19 drug identification. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is highly genetically similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (∼ 89% similarity). With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for the nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions. Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in the SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A gene-ontology-based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at a ∼99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies 37 level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in the human protein-interaction network. 2474 level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network is finally validated using six potential FDA-listed drugs for COVID-19 with significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified spreader proteins.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ycjyLU

medical,"Among the 30 nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in the Omicron S-gene are 13 that have only rarely been seen in other SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These mutations cluster within three functionally important regions of the S-gene at sites that will likely impact (1) interactions between subunits of the Spike trimer and the predisposition of subunits to shift from down to up configurations, (2) interactions of Spike with ACE2 receptors, and (3) the priming of Spike for membrane fusion. We show here that, based on both the rarity of these 13 mutations in intrapatient sequencing reads and patterns of selection at the codon sites where the mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses, prior to the emergence of Omicron the mutations would have been predicted to decrease the fitness of any virus within which they occurred. We further propose that the mutations in each of the three clusters therefore cooperatively interact to both mitigate their individual fitness costs, and, in combination with other mutations, adaptively alter the function of Spike. Given the evident epidemic growth advantages of Omicron overall previously known SARS-CoV-2 lineages, it is crucial to determine both how such complex and highly adaptive mutation constellations were assembled within the Omicron S-gene, and why, despite unprecedented global genomic surveillance efforts, the early stages of this assembly process went completely undetected.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",u0qpvs

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Terminal complement amplification is hypothesized to be a key contributor to the clinical manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen. METHODS: Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on day 22. Free C5 levels < 0.5 μg/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing interval > 175 μg/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240 ± 67 μg/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remained > 175 μg/mL and free C5 concentrations remained < 0.5 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22 days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phase 3 study.

These societal challenges are addressed by four main pillars of the CCI, namely: (1) Europeans’ creativity, cultural diversity and values;(2) European identity and cohesion;(3) European employment, economic resilience and smart growth;and (4) Europe’s external relations. We address each societal challenge from the CCI perspective, indicating how the CCI can provide innovative responses to such challenges and enable strategic crossovers through networking and collaboration, but also referring to some criticalities. We further discuss how this CCI capacity needs public support and provide an overview of how this is undertaken via the main EU, national and international policies, with a focus on the latest trends.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",05D09K

medical,"For a large number of health care providers world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is their first experience in population-based care. In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO's singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of ""one medicine, one health"" defines what global public health is today.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nyBV6M
medical,"RATIONALE The mechanisms underlying impaired sleep quality in insomnia are not fully known, but an important role for sleep fragmentation has been proposed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality. METHODS We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors. RESULTS In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p < 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p < 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p < 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lqdZdU

medical,"Introduction Le confinement strict de mars 2020, visant à contenir la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, a réduit l’accès aux soins et les interactions sociales. Nous avons souhaité en étudier les conséquences sur l’incidence des infections sexuellement transmissibles (IST). Matériel et méthodes Étude rétrospective, multicentrique, des tests de dépistage du Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), du gonocoque (NG), de la syphilis, du VIH et du VHB réalisés dans les CeGIDD du Grand Est, entre le 18/03 et le 31/08/2020 avec analyse en 4 sous-périodes : confinement strict (18/03–10/05)/limitation des déplacements dans un périmètre de 100km (11/05–01/06)/1re partie des levées de restriction en juin (02/06–30/06)/2e partie en juillet–août (01/07–31/07), comparativement aux mêmes périodes de 2018 et 2019. Résultats Durant la période de confinement strict, le nombre de tests effectués était significativement réduit (–95 %) avec une incidence de chaque IST stable, avec des observations similaires pendant la période de déplacement restreint (baisse>50 % des dépistages totaux). Dès le mois de juin, alors que le nombre de tests effectués devenait comparable à celui des années antérieures, on commençait à noter une hausse significative des infections à CT de +8 % et +20 % comparativement à juin 2019 et 2018, alors que l’incidence des autres IST restait alors constante. En juillet–août, l’incidence globale des IST était de +25 % et de +21 %, avec majoration des infections à CT de +46 % et de +56 % par rapport à 2019 et 2018, respectivement. Discussion Nous rapportons ici une augmentation de l’incidence globale des IST durant l’été 2020 dans la région Grand Est, comparativement à l’été 2019 et 2018, marquée surtout par une hausse de l’incidence des cas de CT, suggérant un impact des mesures sanitaires sur le comportement sexuel de la population étudiée. Deux études rétrospectives européennes ont également montré cette tendance à la baisse des tests totaux de dépistages des IST en 2020, avec hausse des cas de CT une fois les restrictions sanitaires levées. Cette recrudescence des cas de CT et son observation précoce dès le déconfinement pourraient suggérer, du fait de l’accessibilité réduite aux CeGIDD pendant le confinement et du caractère principalement asymptomatique des infections à CT, que le comportement des jeunes sexuellement actifs n’ait pas été restreint par le confinement, voire au contraire s’est libéré, comme par opposition à la restriction des libertés. Conclusion Le déconfinement s’est accompagné d’une augmentation d’incidence des IST, que l’on pourrait décrire comme un « IST-boom » durant l’été 2020. Il est important que la communauté médicale en soit informée, notamment pour les IST asymptomatiques, Chlamydia trachomatis en premier lieu, ayant possiblement échappé aux dépistages et qui sont actuellement latentes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-vJ1hs

We present Trade Execution using Reinforcement Learning (TradeR) which aims to address two such practical challenges of catastrophy and surprise minimization by formulating trading as a real-world hierarchical RL problem. Through this lens, TradeR makes use of hierarchical RL to execute trade bids on high frequency real market experiences comprising of abrupt price variations during the 2019 fiscal year COVID19 stock market crash. The framework utilizes an energy-based scheme in conjunction with surprise value function for estimating and minimizing surprise.

medical,"The use of telehealth technology to connect with patients has expanded significantly over the past several years, particularly in response to the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This technical report describes the present state of telehealth and its current and potential applications. Telehealth has the potential to transform the way care is delivered to pediatric patients, expanding access to pediatric care across geographic distances, leveraging the pediatric workforce for care delivery, and improving disparities in access to care. However, implementation will require significant efforts to address the digital divide to ensure that telehealth does not inadvertently exacerbate inequities in care. The medical home model will continue to evolve to use telehealth to provide high-quality care for children, particularly for children and youth with special health care needs, in accordance with current and evolving quality standards. Research and metric development are critical for the development of evidence-based best practices and policies in these new models of care.

Equilibrium solutions are derived, and the influence of risk aversion on the GSC is examined. Our results show that, for the centralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the green level and the retail price, while for the decentralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the wholesale price and the retail price, but it may induce the supplier to increase the green level given a high-risk tolerance of the supplier. Meanwhile, the risk-averse decentralized GSC may obtain more expected profit than the risk-neutral decentralized GSC. Furthermore, this paper designs a revenue-and-cost-sharing joint contract to coordinate the risk-neutral GSC, and such a contract can improve the risk-averse GSC under specific conditions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fs1RbB

Findings: The findings reveal that COVID-19 amplified the country's poor and vulnerable population's socioeconomic conditions because of the stringent Level 5 lockdown regulations that barred low-income households from making a livelihood. It further revealed that low-income households, who are the least educated, Black African, female and marginalized, were disproportionally socioeconomically affected by losing the main household income. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited in that it used secondary quantitative data that relied on a telephonic survey during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Practical implications: This study offers a policy suggestion that increasing social grants during the pandemic will not have any significant impact on the livelihoods of many South Africans unless distributional inequalities are reduced. Social implications: The government needs to develop welfarist policies to protect the most vulnerable in society to limit the socioeconomic impact of pandemics and take proactive policy measures to reduce unemployment and income inequalities in the country. Originality/value: The paper contributes to understanding the precarious nature of low-income households. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RncT6a

medical,"BACKGROUNDThe biological processes associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) are unknown. METHODSWe measured soluble markers of inflammation in a SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort at early (<90 days) and late (>90 days) timepoints. We defined PASC as the presence of one or more COVID-19-attributed symptoms beyond 90 days. We compared fold-changes in marker values between those with and without PASC using mixed effects models with terms for PASC and early and late recovery time periods. RESULTSDuring early recovery, those who went on to develop PASC generally had higher levels of cytokine biomarkers including TNF-alpha (1.14-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, p=0.028) and IP-10 (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.62, p=0.038). Among those with PASC, there was a trend toward higher IL-6 levels during early recovery (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 0.98- 1.70, p=0.07) which became more pronounced in late recovery (1.44-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI: 1.11-1.86, p<0.001). These differences were more pronounced among those with a greater number of PASC symptoms. CONCLUSIONSPersistent immune activation may be associated with ongoing symptoms following COVID-19. Further characterization of these processes might identify therapeutic targets for those experiencing PASC.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5s9JC-

medical,"[Image: see text] The Delta variant spreads more rapidly than previous variants of SARS-CoV-2. This variant comprises several mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD(Delta)) of its spike glycoprotein, which binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in host cells. The RBD–PD interaction has been targeted by antibodies and nanobodies to prevent viral infection, but their effectiveness against the Delta variant remains unclear. Here, we investigated RBD(Delta)–PD interactions in the presence and absence of nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing 21.8 μs of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Unbiased simulations revealed that Delta variant mutations strengthen RBD binding to ACE2 by increasing the hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formation, but weaken interactions with H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1. Among these nanobodies H11-H4 and H11-D4 bind RBD without overlapping ACE2. They were unable to dislocate ACE2 from RBD(Delta) when bound side by side with ACE2 on RBD. Steered molecular dynamics simulations at comparable loading rates to high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments estimated lower rupture forces of the nanobodies from RBD(Delta) compared to ACE2. Our results suggest that existing nanobodies are less effective to inhibit RBD(Delta)–PD interactions and a new generation of nanobodies is needed to neutralize the Delta variant.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jZ8OWm

medical,"Breast cancer (BC) consists of malignant cells as well as surrounding non-malignant cells-Fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, mesenchymal stem cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM). This surrounding stroma is referred to as the Breast Tumor Microenvironment (BTME). The components of BTME interact with cancerous breast cells for the promotion of BC. The reciprocal cross-talk between BTME and neoplastic breast cells, through the secretion of chemicals, growth factors and chemokines, may lead to cell proliferation, migration, metastasis as well as immune response suppression. Multiple genetic loci, in association with stromal components, are linked to immunological stimuli to induce BC in ductal cells. These genes participate in tumor activation pathways and promote carcinogenesis via Fibroblast, Leukocyte, and Endothelial Cells-mediated responses. The collaborative effect of the cellular components and BTME-associated genes plays vital role in tumor initiation and metastasis of breast cells. This process involves genes which cause degenerative changes in ECM leading to Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions (EMT), which finally causes metastatic BC. This shows that metastatic breast cancer results from combined activation of different cellular and extracellular components and their activity is primarily controlled by activation of genetic cascade. These components work simultaneously to cause metastatic BC.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cX_4Es

medical,"This article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures intended to slow the rate of transmission of the virus resulted in greater subjective isolation and community distrust, in turn adversely impacting psychological distress. To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers-one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress.

medical,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Restructuring activities have been necessary during the lockdown phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Few data are available on the post-lockdown phase in terms of health-care procedures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care, and no data are available specifically from IBD units. We aimed to investigate how IBD management was restructured during the lockdown phase, the impact of the restructuring on standards of care and how Italian IBD units have managed post-lockdown activities. METHODS: A web-based online survey was conducted in two phases (April and June 2020) among the Italian Group for IBD affiliated units within the entire country. We investigated preventive measures, the possibility of continuing scheduled visits/procedures/therapies because of COVID-19 and how units resumed activities in the post-lockdown phase. RESULTS: Forty-two referral centres participated from all over Italy. During the COVID-19 lockdown, 36% of first visits and 7% of follow-up visits were regularly done, while >70% of follow-up scheduled visits and 5% of first visits were done virtually. About 25% of scheduled endoscopies and bowel ultrasound scans were done. More than 80% of biological therapies were done as scheduled. Compared to the pre-lockdown situation, 95% of centres modified management of outpatient activity, 93% of endoscopies, 59% of gastrointestinal ultrasounds and 33% of biological therapies. Resumption of activities after the lockdown phase may take three to six months to normalize. Virtual clinics, implementation of IBD pathways and facilities seem to be the main factors to improve care in the future. CONCLUSION: Italian IBD unit restructuring allowed quality standards of care during the COVID-19 pandemic to be maintained. A return to normal appears to be feasible and achievable relatively quickly. Some approaches, such as virtual clinics and identified IBD pathways, represent a valid starting point to improve IBD care in the post-COVID-19 era.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ee1C_y
medical,"RELEVANCE: Current and past coronavirus infection can provoke and aggravate the course of previous chronic heart failure by initiating the processes of thrombus formation, inflammation and fibrinogen synthesis, affecting the pleuropericardial space, increasing the load on the right heart due to pulmonary hypertension. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To identify the features of chronic heart failure after COVID-19 infection with lung damage. MATERIAL: An open cohort prospective study of 50 patients was carried out. Inclusion criteria: the presence of a positive brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiographic changes corresponding to systolic or diastolic dysfunction before the onset of the pandemic, signed informed consent. The diagnosis of COVID - 19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test and the presence of M and G antibodies, lung damage - by the results of computed tomography of the lungs. METHODS: Standard clinical examination, quality of life questionnaire, echocardiography with measurement of cavity volume, indicators of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, size and function of the right ventricle. The second examination was carried out one month after hospitalization. RESULTS: The features of the clinical picture were an increase in shortness of breath (38 people, 86%), a decrease in exercise tolerance (40 people, 90%), an increase in chest pain (25 people, 60%), palpitations (40 people, 90%). On echocardiography, the most frequent dynamics compared to the 2019 echocardiography indicators were an increase in pressure in the pulmonary artery (44 people, 100%), the size of the right (38 people, 86%) and left ventricles (30 people, 68%), left atrium (38 people, 86%), an increase in the severity of valvular regurgitation (44 people, 100%) and a decrease in the ejection fraction within the “gray zone” (38 people, 86%). The newly emerging decrease in EF below 45% was recorded much less frequently, in 13 people (30%). In 40 (80%) patients, certain signs of deterioration of left ventricular diastolic function were revealed: dilatation of the left atrium, decrease in the mean e, increase in E/e' according to tissue Doppler ultrasonography. The TAPSE index, which characterizes the global function of the right ventricle, practically did not decrease. Frequent findings during echocardiography one month after the disease were a small amount of fluid in the pericardial cavity (30 people, 68%) and pleuropericardial adhesions. CONCLUSION: The clinical condition of patients with CHF in the first month after a previous infection with COVID-19 with lung involvement corresponded to a worsening of CHF with rhythm disturbances and instability of blood pressure, which on echocardiographic examination was manifested by dilatation of the heart cavities, valvular regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle and increased pressure in the arteries.

medical,"PURPOSE: We reviewed the clinical utility of perfusion (Q)-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT for diagnosing pulmonary embolus (PE) in patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). METHODS: Following the World Health Organization’s declaration of a global pandemic, our department policy recommended Q-only SPECT/CT for all patients undergoing nuclear medicine evaluation for suspected PE to reduce the risk of aerosolization of respiratory droplets. We performed a retrospective review of sequential patients admitted with COVID-19 imaged with Q-SPECT/CT between March 17, 2020, and June 30, 2020, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We recorded patient demographics, clinical symptoms, Wells score (to stratify patients according to pre-test probability for PE prior to Q-SPECT/CT), and noted ancillary imaging findings on CT. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients imaged with Q-SPECT/CT, 6 patients (3 men, 3 women) had a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (mean age, 55, ± 11.4 years, range 33–68). All patients had a current diagnosis of malignancy and had a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE (mean Wells score 2.8, range 2–4). Q-SPECT/CT was positive in 4/6 (67%) of patients. Distribution of pulmonary emboli was bilateral and segmental in 75% of patients. Ancillary acute findings on SPECT/CT included bilateral parenchymal ground glass opacities (n = 5), pleural effusions (n = 2), and pneumomediastinum (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Q-SPECT/CT has clinical utility for diagnosing PE in patients with COVID-19 where there is a contraindication for iodinated contrast media and a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OuonJ2

medical,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has become the most dangerous viral infection worldwide. Since its identification in late 2019, the number of medical trials to combat the infection has sharply increased. Here, we investigated the profiles of IgG and IgM in 85 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from day 1 after symptom onset until day 35 with 5-day intervals. Serum samples were collected and stored until use. We observed that IgM levels were detectable on day 5 post symptom onset and increased sharply, with the highest rate detected in moderate cases (32.332 ± 4.32, n=10). Subsequently, a significant reduction in IgM was observed until it was undetectable on day 35 after symptom onset. Meanwhile, IgG levels were detected on day 10 post symptom onset, and the highest rate was observed in moderate cases (8.232 ± 2.3, n=10). A significant increase in IgG rate was observed in all patients, with the highest rate in moderate cases (42.432 ± 4.34, n=67) on day 35 post symptom onset. The statistical difference between the case and control groups was significant (p≤0.001). Two out of 85 patients died during the study.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Gender and race are known to impact attitudes toward mental health topics and help-seeking behavior. Men and minorities are more likely to cite stigma as a reason for not seeking help for mental health concerns, which is of particular relevance given the high rate of suicide in men and challenges of historic proportion currently facing minority communities. Instagram provides a platform to discuss mental health, though a lack of male and minority representation may further alienate these populations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether men and nonwhite individuals are underrepresented in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth (compared to photos tagged with #health) to better understand how gender and race-based representations are manifested on this popular social media platform and discuss the implications. METHODS: Three investigators of different genders and racial backgrounds met on nine different days via teleconference to analyze a total of 215 publicly available Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth and 215 with #health. These photos were generated using Instagram's search function, and search results were sorted by most recently published at the time of data collection. For each photo, the three investigators recorded their observations about the gender (male versus female) and race (white versus nonwhite versus racially unclassifiable) of subjects featured in the photo, which they did not discuss with other investigators. Chi-squared analysis was performed on each investigator's data set to compare the frequency of male versus female and white versus nonwhite subjects identified in each hashtag category. Kappa interrater agreement was calculated for each investigator pair, category (gender or race), and hashtag. RESULTS: All three investigators observed significantly more female as compared to male subjects in photos tagged with #mentalhealth (X2=14.4, P<.001 for all investigators) while observing no significant difference between numbers of male and female subjects in photos tagged with #health (X2=1.533, P=.22; X2=1.241, P=.27; X2=0.096, P=.76). All three investigators identified significantly more white than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #health and #mentalhealth (X2 values range from 11.912 to 98.927, P<.001 for all). Kappa interrater agreement revealed almost perfect agreement for gender (kappa=0.908-0.992) with the agreement for race ranging from 0.614 to 0.822, depending on hashtag and rater pair. CONCLUSIONS: Women are featured more frequently than men in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth. The topic of #health, meanwhile, is not gendered this way. Low visibility of mental health among men may both represent and exacerbate existing stigma and barriers to care. White subjects are featured significantly more frequently than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #mentalhealth and #health. Directed interventions using the Instagram platform may be indicated to increase the visibility of underrepresented groups and break the cycle of stigma.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7kJq4N
medical,"Background: There is increasing evidence suggesting that liver dysfunction is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness However, due to the low prevalence of liver disease and cirrhosis in the general population, larger studies looking at the impact of these conditions have utilized data from international registries which do not necessarily reflect the US population Our study aims to assess the association between chronic liver disease and COVID-19 clinical outcomes across a single large inpatient cohort Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study at a large tertiary care hospital All index admissions of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 between 3/1/2020 and 4/30/2020 were included A manual chart review was performed to collect data on baseline patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, and clinical outcomes Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis were compared to the control group, who had no known underlying liver disease SAS 9 4 was used for analysis Results: A total of 1935 patients met our inclusion criteria of which 1869 (96 6%) had no underlying liver disease, 66 (3 4%) had CLD, and 21 (1 1%) had cirrhosis Table 1 shows baseline patient characteristics There were a higher proportion of males in the CLD and cirrhosis cohorts compared to the control group (67% and 76% vs 50%;p=0 0105) Patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease also had a significantly lower average BMI compared to the control group (25 8 and 27 3 vs 31 8;p=0 002) There was no difference in comorbidities between all three cohorts Patients with cirrhosis had a significantly higher mortality (RR 2 1 [95% CI 1 33-3 62;p=0 0022]) compared to non-cirrhotics There was also a trend towards increased 30-day readmission in the cirrhotic cohort (RR 2 35 [95% CI 0 86-6 42];p=0 0950) however no difference in rate of ICU admission or intubation Patients with CLD did not have an increase in mortality, ICU admission, intubation, or 30-day re-admission compared to the control group Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 while chronic liver disease in the absence of cirrhosis does not confer the same degree of clinical risk Future studies performed on a larger scale should evaluate how decompensated disease and MELD score may impact this risk profile (Table Presented)",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6wZ1MW
medical,"BACKGROUND We aimed to determine the effects of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) on beta-cell function in overweight people with type 2 diabetes and to assess the relationship between baseline beta-cell function and glycemic outcomes. METHODS We studied 44 overweight but not obese people with type 2 diabetes who participated in a randomized trial whose primary outcome was the rate of diabetes remission after 2 years of multidisciplinary diabetes care (MDC group) or multidisciplinary care combined with LAGB. Dynamic beta-cell function was assessed by intravenous glucose challenge, and basal beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) were determined using the homeostatic model. RESULTS Twelve LAGB participants and two MDC participants were in diabetes remission at 2 years. HOMA-S and the C-peptide response to intravenous glucose increased significantly in LAGB but not in MDC participants. The insulin response to glucose did not change in LAGB participants, whereas their fasting C-peptide/insulin ratio increased. Baseline measures of beta-cell function correlated with diabetes remission but not with reduction in HbA1c following LAGB.

medical,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to symptomatic with mild or moderate presentation and severe disease. COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and recovery have demonstrated high variability worldwide. Variances in the host genetic architecture may underlie the inter-individual and population-scale differences in COVID-19 presentation. We performed a genome-wide association analysis employing the genotyping data from AncestryDNA for COVID-19 patients of European descent and used asymptomatic subjects as the control group. We identified 621 genetic variants that were significantly distinct between asymptomatic and acutely symptomatic COVID-19 patients (multiple-testing corrected p-value < 0.001). These variants were found to be associated with pathways governing host immunity, such as interferon, interleukin and cytokine signalling, and known COVID-19 comorbidities, such as obesity and cholesterol metabolism. Further, our ancestry analysis revealed that the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients possess discernibly higher proportions of the Ancestral North Eurasian (ANE) and Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) ancestry, which was introduced to Europe through Bell Beaker culture (Yamnaya related) and lower fractions of Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry, while severely symptomatic patients have higher fractions of WHG and lower ANE/EHG ancestral components, thereby delineating the likely ancestral differences between the two groups.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",o_pD1S

medical,"OBJECTIVES: Antimalarials have been associated with QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients but are generally safe in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).We compared the prevalence of QTc prolongation between COVID-19 and SLE patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). METHODS: We included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and patients taking HCQ for SLE. A prolonged QTc was defined as an increase in QTc intervals >60 ms (compared with baseline) or as a QTc of ≥500 ms. We performed the univariate and multivariate logistic regression to investigate the risk factors for QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 COVID-19 patients (median age 70.5 years, IQR 25), grouped into group A (patients with HCQ) group B (patients with HCQ + azithromycin) and group C (not received either drug). Fifty (26%) COVID-19 patients presented a QTc prolongation (12 QTc≥500 ms, 3 patients ΔQTc>60 ms). We did not find any differences in QTc prolongation among the three treatment groups. Baseline QTc (OR 111.5) and D-dimer (OR 78.3) were independently associated to QTc prolongation. Compared to the 50 SLE patients (median age 38.5 years, IQR 22), chronically treated with HCQ, COVID-19 patients showed significantly longer QTc (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that, unlike COVID-19 patients, patients with SLE are not susceptible to HCQ-induced long QT syndrome and arrhythmia. The combined arrhythmogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and HCQ could account for the excess of QTc prolongation and fatal arrhythmias described in patients with COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lWAWJc

medical,"BACKGROUND: To understand which irregular corneal parameters determine the visual quality in keratoconus subjects. METHODS: The cross-sectional study examined the eyes of 44 subjects, graded from the first to third keratoconus stages by Amsler-Krumeich classification. We obtained measurements in two ways: (a) by projecting two perpendicular axes onto a cornea (first, through the central point of the cornea and keratoconus apex; second, as the perpendicular axis) to read the elevation values at points on these axes as parameters characterising the corneal surface; (b) by projecting circles with different diameters around the central part of the cornea (1, 2, and 3 mm) and reading elevation values at points equally displaced on these circles as parameters characterising an anterior surface slope. Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WzoL-v
medical,"We present recent updates for $\varepsilon_K$ determined directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $\xi_\text{LD}$, $f_K$, and $m_c$. We find that the standard model with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ and other lattice QCD inputs describes only 66\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$ and does not explain its remaining 34\%, which leads to a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $4.5\sigma \sim 3.7\sigma$ level between the SM theory and experiment. We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of $|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule approach.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_-43Hd

medical,"BACKGROUND: Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza pneumonia are highly contagious and present with similar symptoms. We aimed to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical features between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia in the early stage and to identify the most valuable features in the differential diagnosis. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 48 patients with influenza pneumonia confirmed by direct/indirect immunofluorescence antibody staining or RT-PCR were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data including course of disease, age, sex, body temperature, clinical symptoms, total white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil count, neutrophil ratio, and C-reactive protein, as well as 22 qualitative and 25 numerical imaging features from non-contrast-enhanced chest CT images were obtained and compared between the COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia groups. Correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia was also evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-three COVID-19 patients including 41 male and 32 female with mean age of 41.9 ± 14.1 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients including 30 male and 18 female with mean age of 40.4 ± 27.3 were reviewed. Temperature, WBC count, crazy paving pattern, pure GGO in peripheral area, pure GGO, lesion sizes (1–3 cm), emphysema, and pleural traction were significantly independent associated with COVID-19. The AUC of clinical-based model on the combination of temperature and WBC count is 0.880 (95% CI: 0.819–0.940). The AUC of radiological-based model on the combination of crazy paving pattern, pure GGO in peripheral area, pure GGO, lesion sizes (1–3 cm), emphysema, and pleural traction is 0.957 (95% CI: 0.924–0.989). The AUC of combined model based on the combination of clinical and radiological is 0.991 (95% CI: 0.980–0.999). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can be distinguished from influenza pneumonia based on CT imaging and clinical features, with the highest AUC of 0.991, of which crazy-paving pattern and WBC count play most important role in the differential diagnosis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZWYgOF
medical,"Objectives: To examine anxiety disorders in aging Black adults. Methods: Using nationally representative data from the National Survey of American Life, we estimated lifetime/12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in Black men and women, age 50+ (N = 1561). Disorder-specific persistence and severity, functional impairment, and mental health service utilization were investigated using multivariate regressions. Results: Black men and women who met criteria for anxiety disorders (lifetime prevalence=12.4%/18.3% in men/women) also demonstrated persistent disorders (percent meeting criteria = 40.3%-61.2%). Those with a 12-month anxiety disorder (6.2%/10.5% of men/women) typically reported severe task interference (38.3%-85.7%). Those with any 12-month anxiety disorder, compared to those without, experienced greater impairment in days out of role, work, family burden, cognition and, in women, mobility (p's < .05). Only 47.0%/65.2% of Black men/women with any lifetime anxiety disorder used mental health services.

medical,"The Covid-19 emergency is demonstrating the need to follow new solutions that can support the important role played by non-profit organizations around the world. Contrary to what should have happened to further combat the effect of pandemic, the majority of philanthropic organisations had a negative impact on fundraising, suffering a substantial decrease. Today, the Blockchain can play a pivotal role to re-establish pre-pandemic standards and enhance the development of global philanthropy. However, it is still too little considered due to the criticalities encountered during the launch and development of the initiatives as well as for a general incomprehension of its technology. Therefore, this work aims to demonstrate the Blockchain impact on the development of charity 4.0, especially in an extremely dramatic historical moment marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective is achieved through the case study of Charity Wall, an emerging Italian social marketplace appreciated by important business associations for its innovative solutions in the charity 4.0 sector and for the important support provided to NPOs during their traditional function as well as against Covid-19 in Italy. Through a benchmark analysis, this work succeeds in highlighting the innovative solutions proposed by Charity Wall compared to the charity 4.0 systems on the market. More specifically, through the Charity Wall case study it is possible to demonstrate which aspects of Blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the philanthropic system by avoiding cases of fraud to the detriment of beneficiaries, receivers and donors as well as to create a closer network between the various philanthropic players to support charitable initiatives against the Covid-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ThO1XL

This disease not only causes public health concerns but also causes a number of psychological illnesses including depression. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 quarantine among the elderly in Iran. Methods & Materials This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted on 432 eligible older adults living in Gonabad city who were selected by cluster random sampling method. Data were collected by a demographic checklist and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) which were completed via phone. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS software using descriptive and inferential statistics, considering a significance level of P<0.05. Results The prevalence of depression was 55.8% which had a statistically significant relationship with marital status (P<0.001), living status (P<0.001), economic status (P<0.001), family history of depression (P<0.001), history of chronic disease (P<0.003), level of education (P<0.001), and sleep quality (P<0.001).

medical,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has become one of the most common surgical procedures to date. To improve and standardize this technique further, cost-effective and reliable animal models are needed. METHODS In a pilot study, 30 Wistar rats underwent laparoscopic caecum resection (as rats do not have an appendix vermiformis), to optimize the instrumental and surgical parameters. A subsequent test study was performed in another 30 rats to compare three different techniques for caecum resection and bowel closure. RESULTS Bipolar coagulation led to an insufficiency of caecal stump closure in all operated rats (Group 1, n = 10). Endoloop ligation followed by bipolar coagulation and resection (Group 2, n = 10) or resection with a LigaSure™ device (Group 3, n = 10) resulted in sufficient caecal stump closure. CONCLUSIONS We developed a LA model enabling us to compare three different caecum resection techniques in rats. In conclusion, only endoloop closure followed by bipolar coagulation proved to be a secure and cost-effective surgical approach.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9yKxqZ
medical,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent risk factor for mortality, which affects about 5% of hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients and up to 25-29% of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine show in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have been used for the treatment of COVID-19. Both, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The impact of a triple therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) on kidney function in COVID-19 is currently not known. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed both non-ICU and ICU patients with COVID-19 receiving triple therapy for the incidence of AKI. Patients receiving standard therapy served as a control group. All patients were hospitalized at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, between March and April 2020. A matched-pair analysis for the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 was performed to control for the severity of illness among non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. RESULTS: In non-ICU patients, the incidence of AKI was markedly increased following triple therapy (78.6% vs. 21.4% in controls, p = 0.002), while a high incidence of AKI was observed in both groups of ICU patients (triple therapy: 80.0%, control group: 90.5%). ICU patients treated with triple therapy showed a trend towards more oliguric or anuric kidney injury. We also observed a linear correlation between the duration of the triple therapy and the maximum serum creatinine level (p = 0.004, R2 = 0.276, R = 0.597). CONCLUSION: Triple therapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of AKI in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. The underlying mechanisms may comprise a CYP3A4 enzyme interaction, and may be relevant for any future therapy combining hydroxychloroquine with antiviral agents.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",b6qL5i

medical,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of occupational burnout among ophthalmologists in order to better understand the mental and physical well-being of eye physicians and surgeons in the professional workplace. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Online computer databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched systematically and thoroughly. Conferences held through Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Canadian Society of Ophthalmology were searched. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Data on reported burnout prevalence was extracted. STATA 15.0 was used to conduct meta-analysis.Synthesis: Our search strategy identified 318 records from online databases and 11 records from grey literature search, which were screened at 2-levels. Title and abstracts of each record were screened resulting in 24 records moving to full-text screening. Total of 9 records were utilized for quantitative analysis in the data extraction stage. Our results indicated significant professional burnout among ophthalmologists (ES = 0.41; CI: [0.26, 0.56]) with significant emotional exhaustion (ES = 0.43; CI: [0.33, 0.53]), depersonalization (ES = 0.29; CI: [0.13, 0.46]), and a low sense of personal accomplishment (ES = 0.36; CI: [0.08, 0.63]). CONCLUSIONS: Significant occupational burnout among ophthalmologists is concerning because burnout can have a negative effect on the physical and mental health of eye physicians and surgeons. It could impact productivity, cutbacks in work hours, or lead to early retirement from the profession. Contributing factors in ophthalmologist burnout including work overload need to be addressed in a timely manner.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",eJPQ4V

medical,"BACKGROUND: The invasive species Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito, has undergone extreme range expansion by means of steady introductions as blind passengers in vehicles traveling from the Mediterranean to south-west Germany. The more than 25 established populations in the State of Baden-Württemberg, Palatine and Hesse (south-west Germany) have become a major nuisance and public health threat. Aedes albopictus deserves special attention as a vector of arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. In Germany, Ae. albopictus control programs are implemented by local communities under the auspices of health departments and regulatory offices. METHODS: The control strategy comprised three pillars: (i) community participation (CP) based on the elimination of breeding sites or improved environmental sanitation, using fizzy tablets based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (fizzy Bti tablets; Culinex® Tab plus); (ii) door-to-door (DtD) control by trained staff through the application of high doses of a water-dispersible Bti granular formulation (Vectobac® WG) aimed at achieving a long-lasting killing effect; and (iii) implementation of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate remaining Ae. albopictus populations. Prior to initiating large-scale city-wide treatments on a routine basis, the efficacy of the three elements was evaluated in laboratory and semi-field trials. Special emphasis was given to the mass release of sterile Ae. albopictus males. RESULTS: More than 60% of the local residents actively participated in the first pillar (CP) of the large-scale control program. The most effective element of the program was found to be the DtD intervention, including the application of Vectobac® WG (3000 ITU/mg) to potential breeding sites (10 g per rainwater container, maximum of 200 l = maximum of approx. 150,000 ITU/l, and 2.5 g per container < 50 l) with a persistence of at least 3 weeks. In Ludwigshafen, larval source management resulted in a Container Index for Ae. albopictus of < 1% in 2020 compared to 10.9% in 2019. The mean number of Aedes eggs per ovitrap per 2 weeks was 4.4 in Ludwigshafen, 18.2 in Metzgergrün (Freiburg) (SIT area) and 22.4 in the control area in Gartenstadt (Freiburg). The strong reduction of the Ae. albopictus population by Bti application was followed by weekly releases of 1013 (Ludwigshafen) and 2320 (Freiburg) sterile Ae. albopictus males per hectare from May until October, resulting in a high percentage of sterile eggs. In the trial areas of Ludwigshafen and Frieburg, egg sterility reached 84.7 ± 12.5% and 62.7 ± 25.8%, respectively; in comparison, the natural sterility in the control area was 14.6 ± 7.3%. The field results were in line with data obtained in cage tests under laboratory conditions where sterility rates were 87.5 ± 9.2% after wild females mated with sterile males; in comparison, the sterility of eggs laid by females mated with unirradiated males was only 3.3 ± 2.8%. The overall egg sterility of about 84% in Ludwigshafen indicates that our goal to almost eradicate the Ae. albopictus population could be achieved. The time for inspection and treatment of a single property ranged from 19 to 26 min depending on the experience of the team and costs 6–8 euros per property. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that an integrated control program based on a strict monitoring scheme can be most effective when it comprises three components, namely CP, DtD intervention that includes long-lasting Bti-larviciding to strongly reduce Ae. albopictus populations and SIT to reduce the remaining Ae. albopictus population to a minimum or even to eradicate it. The combined use of Bti and SIT is the most effective and selective tool against Ae. albopictus, one of the most dangerous mosquito vector species.

Issues Les exposés de cas issus d’Asie laissent entendre que les issues maternelles et fœtales sont aggravées par la présence du SRAS pendant la grossesse. Résultats Des recherches ont été menées dans Medline afin d’en tirer les articles pertinents publiés en anglais entre 2000 et 2007. Des exposés de cas ont été analysés et nous avons sollicité l’opinion de spécialistes. Valeurs Les recommandations ont été formulées conformément aux lignes directrices élaborées par le Groupe d’étude canadien sur les soins de santé préventifs. Commanditaire La Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada. Recommandations 1. Tous les hôpitaux devraient mettre en œuvre des systèmes de prévention des infections, afin de s’assurer que des alertes au sujet des modifications que connaissent les facteurs de risque d’exposition au SRAS ou à d’autres maladies transmissibles potentiellement graves sont communiquées sans tarder aux unités cliniques, y compris l’unité de travail et d’accouchement (III-C). 2. En présence d’une éclosion de SRAS, toutes les patientes enceintes évaluées ou admises à l’hôpital devraient faire l’objet d’un dépistage des symptômes et des facteurs de risque du SRAS (III-C). 3. À leur arrivée au sein de l’unité de triage quant au travail, les patientes enceintes chez lesquelles la présence du SRAS est soupçonnée et probable devraient être placées dans une salle d’isolement dotée d’un système de ventilation à pression négative comptant au moins six renouvellements d’air à l’heure. Toutes les unités de travail et d’accouchement offrant des soins à des patientes chez lesquelles la présence du SRAS est soupçonnée et probable devraient disposer d’au moins une salle dans laquelle ces patientes peuvent connaître leur travail et leur accouchement en toute sûreté, et ce, malgré la nécessité d’assurer un isolement aérogène (III-C). 4. Dans la mesure du possible, le travail et l’accouchement (y compris l’accouchement opératoire ou la césarienne) devraient être pris en charge, dans une salle d’isolement désignée dotée d’un système de ventilation à pression négative, par du personnel désigné disposant d’une tenue de protection et d’une formation spécialisée en prévention des infections (III-C). 5. Tant l’anesthésie régionale que générale peuvent s’avérer adéquates pour l’accouchement des patientes atteintes du SRAS (III-C). 6. Les nouveau-nés issus de mères atteintes du SRAS devraient être isolés au sein d’une unité désignée jusqu’à ce que leur état ait été satisfaisant pendant 10 jours ou jusqu’à ce que la période d’isolement de la mère ait pris fin. La mère ne devrait pas allaiter pendant cette période (III-C). 7. Une équipe multidisciplinaire (comprenant des obstétriciens, des infirmières, des pédiatres, des spécialistes de la prévention des infections, des inhalothérapeutes et des anesthésiologistes) devrait être nommée au sein de chaque unité et être responsable de l’organisation et de la mise en œuvre des protocoles de prise en charge du SRAS de l’unité (III-C). 8. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS ne devraient pas offrir leurs services aux autres patientes enceintes. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS devraient activement faire l’objet d’une surveillance visant la fièvre et d’autres symptômes du SRAS. Ces personnes ne devraient pas travailler en présence de tout symptôme du SRAS se manifestant dans les 10 jours suivant une exposition à un patient atteint du SRAS (III-C). 9. Tous les professionnels des soins de santé, les résidents et les membres du personnel de soutien devraient bénéficier d’une formation sur la prise en charge et le confinement des infections afin de prévenir la propagation du virus du SRAS (III-A). 10. Les autorités sanitaires régionales, conjointement avec le personnel hospitalier, devraient envisager la désignation d’établissements ou d’unités de soins de santé particulières (y compris des centres de soins primaires, secondaires ou tertiaires) en ce qui concerne l’offre de soins aux patients atteints du SRAS ou de maladies semblables (III-A).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oNbtHw

Although general and local public health report deathly cases, case fatality rates are still largely unknown. Thus, we sought to evaluate the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients that included clinical outcomes, between December 2020 and 24 April 2020. Two authors performed an independent selection using predefined terms of search. RESULTS: We retrieved 33 studies with a total of 13,398 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients was 17.1% (95% CI 12.7; 22.7, I2 = 96.9%). For general patients admitted to the hospital (excluding critical care-only studies) the mortality rate of the COVID-19 was 11.5% (95% CI 7.7; 16.9, I2 = 96.7%).

medical," COPD COPD Español Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. Causes Long-term exposure to lung irritants that damage the lungs and the airways usually is the cause of COPD. In the United States, the most common irritant that causes COPD is cigarette smoke. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke also can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Breathing in secondhand smoke, which is in the air from other people smoking; air pollution; or chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace also can contribute to COPD. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may play a role in causing COPD. People who have this condition have low blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)—a protein made in the liver. Having a low level of the AAT protein can lead to lung damage and COPD if you are exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. If you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and also smoke, COPD can worsen very quickly. Some people who have asthma can develop COPD. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing that occurs in asthma. Risk Factors The main risk factor for COPD is smoking. Up to 75 percent of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. People who have a family history of COPD are more likely to develop the disease if they smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants also is a risk factor for COPD. Examples of other lung irritants include air pollution, chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. Although uncommon, people younger than 40 can have COPD. This may occur, for example, if a person has a predisposing health issue, such as the genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Signs & Symptoms At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. Common signs and symptoms of COPD include: An ongoing cough or a cough that produces a lot of mucus; this is often called smoker's cough. Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Chest tightness If you have COPD, you also may often have colds or other respiratory infections such as the flu, or influenza. Not everyone who has the symptoms described above has COPD. Likewise, not everyone who has COPD has these symptoms. Some of the symptoms of COPD are similar to the symptoms of other diseases and conditions. Your doctor can determine if you have COPD. If your symptoms are mild, you may not notice them, or you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. Over time, symptoms may become severe enough to cause you to see a doctor. For example, you may become short of breath during physical exertion. The severity of your symptoms will depend on how much lung damage you have. If you keep smoking, the damage will occur faster than if you stop smoking. Severe COPD can cause other symptoms, such as swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs; weight loss; and lower muscle endurance. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. You—or, if you are unable, family members or friends—should seek emergency care if you are experiencing the following: You are having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray, a sign of a low oxygen level in your blood. People around you notice that you are not mentally alert. Your heartbeat is very fast. The recommended treatment for symptoms that are getting worse is not working. Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Your doctor may ask whether you smoke or have had contact with lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts. If you have an ongoing cough, let your doctor know how long you've had it, how much you cough, and how much mucus comes up when you cough. Also, let your doctor know whether you have a family history of COPD. Your doctor will examine you and use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing or other abnormal chest sounds. He or she also may recommend one or more tests to diagnose COPD. Pulmonary Function Tests Pulmonary function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The main test for COPD is spirometry. Other lung function tests, such as a lung diffusion capacity test, also might be used. Read Pulmonary Function Tests for more information. Spirometry During this painless test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then, you'll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Spirometry Your doctor may have you inhale, or breathe in, medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. He or she can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: A chest x ray or chest CT scan. These tests create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show signs of COPD. They also may show whether another condition, such as heart failure, is causing your symptoms. An arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. The results from this test can show how severe your COPD is and whether you need oxygen therapy. Treatment COPD has no cure yet. However, lifestyle changes and treatments can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. The goals of COPD treatment include: Relieving your symptoms Slowing the progress of the disease Improving your exercise tolerance or your ability to stay active Preventing and treating complications Improving your overall health To assist with your treatment, your family doctor may advise you to see a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in treating lung disorders. Lifestyle Changes Quit Smoking and Avoid Lung Irritants Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dusts, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale. For more information about how to quit smoking, read Smoking and Your Heart and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Other Lifestyle Changes If you have COPD, especially more severe forms, you may have trouble eating enough because of symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. As a result, you may not get all of the calories and nutrients you need, which can worsen your symptoms and raise your risk for infections. Talk with your doctor about following an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Your doctor may suggest eating smaller, more frequent meals; resting before eating; and taking vitamins or nutritional supplements. Also, talk with your doctor about what types of activity are safe for you. You may find it hard to remain active with your symptoms. However, physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines Bronchodilators Bronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your COPD, your doctor may prescribe short-acting or long-acting bronchodilators. Short-acting bronchodilators last about 4–6 hours and should be used only when needed. Long-acting bronchodilators last about 12 hours or more and are used every day. Most bronchodilators are taken using a device called an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your health care providers to show you the correct way to use your inhaler. If your COPD is mild, your doctor may only prescribe a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. In this case, you may use the medicine only when symptoms occur. If your COPD is moderate or severe, your doctor may prescribe regular treatment with short- and long-acting bronchodilators. Combination Bronchodilators Plus Inhaled Glucocorticosteroids (Steroids) In general, using inhaled steroids alone is not a preferred treatment. If your COPD is more severe, or if your symptoms flare up often, your doctor may prescribe a combination of medicines that includes a bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid. Steroids help reduce airway inflammation. Your doctor may ask you to try inhaled steroids with the bronchodilator for a trial period of 6 weeks to 3 months to see whether the addition of the steroid helps relieve your breathing problems. Vaccines Flu Shots The flu, or influenza, can cause serious problems for people who have COPD. Flu shots can reduce your risk of getting the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot. Pneumococcal Vaccine This vaccine lowers your risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and its complications. People who have COPD are at higher risk for pneumonia than people who do not have COPD. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get this vaccine. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation or rehab is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. Rehab may include an exercise program, disease management training, and nutritional and psychological counseling. The program's goal is to help you stay active and carry out your daily activities. Your rehab team may include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians. These health professionals will create a program that meets your needs. Oxygen Therapy If you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood, oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. For this treatment, oxygen is delivered through nasal prongs or a mask. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. For some people who have severe COPD, using extra oxygen for most of the day can help them: Do tasks or activities while experiencing fewer symptoms Protect their hearts and other organs from damage Sleep more during the night and improve alertness during the day Live longer Surgery Surgery may benefit some people who have COPD. Surgery usually is a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not improved from taking medicines. Surgeries for people who have COPD that is mainly related to emphysema include bullectomy and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). A lung transplant might be an option for people who have very severe COPD. Bullectomy When the walls of the air sacs are destroyed, larger air spaces called bullae form. These air spaces can become so large that they interfere with breathing. In a bullectomy, doctors remove one or more very large bullae from the lungs. Lung Volume Reduction Surgery In LVRS, surgeons remove damaged tissue from the lungs. This helps the lungs work better. In carefully selected patients, LVRS can improve breathing and quality of life. Lung Transplant During a lung transplant, doctors remove your damaged lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a donor. A lung transplant can improve your lung function and quality of life. However, lung transplants have many risks, such as infections and rejection of the transplanted lung. If you have very severe COPD, talk with your doctor about whether a lung transplant is an option. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of this type of surgery. Managing Complications COPD symptoms usually worsen slowly over time. However, they can worsen suddenly. For instance, a cold, flu, or lung infection may cause your symptoms to quickly worsen. You may have a much harder time catching your breath. You also may have chest tightness, more coughing, changes in the color or amount of your sputum or spit, and a fever. Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. He or she may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, along with other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, to help you breathe. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. For more information, read Signs and Symptoms. Prevention You can take steps to prevent COPD before it starts. If you already have COPD, you can take steps to prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. Prevent COPD Before It Starts The best way to prevent COPD is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking.

Prevent Complications and Slow the Progression of COPD If you have COPD, the most important step you can take is to quit smoking. Quitting can help prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. You also should avoid exposure to the lung irritants mentioned above. Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. They can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and avoid or manage severe symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can lower your chances of getting these illnesses, which are major health risks for people who have COPD. Living With COPD has no cure yet. However, you can take steps to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Avoid lung irritants. Get ongoing care. Manage the disease and its symptoms. Prepare for emergencies. Avoid Lung Irritants If you smoke, quit. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Keep these irritants out of your home. If you are getting your home painted or sprayed for insects, have it done when you can stay away for a while. If possible, keep your windows closed and stay at home when there is a lot of air pollution or dusts outside. Get Ongoing Care If you have COPD, it is important to get ongoing medical care. Take all your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Make sure to refill your prescriptions before they run out. Bring a list of all the medicines you are taking when you have medical checkups. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. Also, ask him or her about other diseases for which COPD may increase your risk, such as heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia. Manage COPD and Its Symptoms You can do things to help manage COPD and its symptoms. For example: Do activities slowly. Put items you use often in one easy-to-reach place. Find simple ways to cook, clean, and do other chores. For example, you might want to use a small table or cart with wheels to move things around and a pole or tongs with long handles to reach things. Ask for help in making things more accessible in your house so that you won't need to climb stairs as often. Keep your clothes loose, and wear clothes and shoes that are easy to put on and take off. Depending on how severe your disease is, you may want to ask your family and friends for help with daily tasks. Prepare for Emergencies If you have COPD, know when and where to seek help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. For more information on severe symptoms of COPD, read Signs and Symptoms. Call your doctor if you notice that your symptoms are worsening or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever. Your doctor may change or adjust your treatments to relieve and treat symptoms. Keep phone numbers handy for your doctor, hospital, and someone who can take you for medical care. You also should have on hand directions to the doctor's office and hospital and a list of all the medicines you are taking. Emotional Issues and Support Living with COPD may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also might help. If you are depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with COPD. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.

medical,"A growing number of older adults maintain connections in their core discussion networks at variant distances, raising concerns about the lack of discussants in proximity and the consequences on their social life. This study examines the typical geographic layouts for aging Europeans' core discussion networks and their implications for network function and quality. With a sample of community-dwelling respondents aged 50 and above from the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe, the present research identifies seven geographic layouts that extend previously identified family and diverse network types by adding spatial nuance. Individuals in mid-range and distant-family networks typically lack a discussant nearby but sustain high emotional closeness with family discussants at a distance and express high overall satisfaction with their network. Proximate-diverse networks with a strong representation of non-kin members nearby turn out to be less advantageous than prior research might suggest, providing relatively frequent contact but the lowest level of network satisfaction. Results also identify how individual characteristics link to the geographic layouts and describe their prevalence across European regions. Overall, relatively dispersed layouts are common for older adults across multiple countries and do not necessarily indicate lower emotional closeness and network satisfaction.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between ring finger protein 6 (RNF6) and glycogen synthase kinase 3ß (GSK3ß) in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: In this study, cell models of overexpressed or silenced RNF6 were established by liposome transfection, and IM-12 was used as the inhibitor of GSK3ß. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blots were used to detect the expression of RNF6, p-GSK3ß, GSK3ß, and ß-catenin, and MTT assays were used to quantify cell proliferation. The tumorigenicity of cells was observed by plate clonal formation assay; the invasiveness of cells was examined in Transwell Boyden chambers, and the migratory capacity of cells was tested by scratch wound assays. The rat CRC model was induced by AOM/DSS, in which we verified activity in the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway by examining GSK3ß phosphorylation. RESULTS: RNF6 was upregulated in CRC samples and cell lines. Silencing or overexpressing RNF6 in colorectal cancer cells inhibited or promoted, respectively, the proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration of CRC cells, as well as expression of p-GSK3ß, GSK3ß and ß-catenin. IM-12 reversed the Wnt/ß-catenin-activated state change induced by RNF6 silencing and the inhibition of cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration. The same results were observed in vivo in the rat CRC model. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of RNF6 in CRC increased the GSK3ß phosphorylation level, which led to activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and promoted the invasion and migration of CRC cells, suggesting that RNF6 may be a novel target for the treatment of CRC.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LSR7e_

medical,"Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA may represent a viable diagnostic alternative to respiratory RNA levels that rapidly decline after infection. RT-qPCR reference assays exhibit poor performance with plasma, likely reflecting dilution and degradation of viral RNA released into the circulation, but these issues could be addressed by analyzing viral RNA packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs). Herein we describe an assay approach where EVs directly captured from plasma are fused with reagent-loaded liposomes to sensitively amplify and detect a SARS-CoV-2 gene target. This approach accurately diagnosed COVID-19 patients, including challenging cases missed by RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2-positive EVs were detected at day one post-infection, and plateaued from day six to the day 28 endpoint in a non-human primate model, while 20–60 day signal durations were observed in young children. This nanotechnology approach, which uses a non-infectious sample, could thus improve COVID-19 diagnosis by extending virus detection windows to identify COVID-19 cases missed by current assays.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sF1Rps

medical,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including the latest COVID-19 pandemic, have emerged and raised global public health crises in recent decades. Without existing protective immunity, an EID may spread rapidly and cause mass casualties in a very short time. Therefore, it is imperative to identify cases with risk of disease progression for the optimized allocation of medical resources in case medical facilities are overwhelmed with a flood of patients. This study has aimed to cope with this challenge from the aspect of preventive medicine by exploiting machine learning technologies. The study has been based on 83,227 hospital admissions with influenza-like illness and we analysed the risk effects of 19 comorbidities along with age and gender for severe illness or mortality risk. The experimental results revealed that the decision rules derived from the machine learning based prediction models can provide valuable guidelines for the healthcare policy makers to develop an effective vaccination strategy. Furthermore, in case the healthcare facilities are overwhelmed by patients with EID, which frequently occurred in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the frontline physicians can incorporate the proposed prediction models to triage patients suffering minor symptoms without laboratory tests, which may become scarce during an EID disaster. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated an effective approach to exploit machine learning technologies to cope with the challenges faced during the outbreak of an EID.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DyadE_

medical,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: In March, thrown into the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic the first test result was returned on the first suspected of this virus. Since, we implemented numerous plans of action, control measures, test procedures and managed the flow of accurate information to the entire facility. METHODS: Control and leadership engagement were key to our success. Control of collection process, creating collection “kits”, methods of shipment, results reporting and regulated distribution. Key players maintained order and track all samples on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet utilized was the most vital tool in weeks to come. Daily updates for both supplies and samples. Simultaneously, researching test capabilities with current analyzers. Daily huddles and group meetings to coordinate all efforts which included manning. RESULTS: Supply counts three times a day at the start and collection “kits” weekly. This measured the capabilities initially. Counting errors lead to numerous redundancies. This was a burden and abandoned. Reference laboratory instructions were verified for all transport media allowed and was as a starting point. Daily usage was subtracted. Patient management was populated with sample specificities, patient demographics and testing locations. Every result called to provider, public health, infectious disease, and a sanitized report to hospital management. This data became “the” source and used as a check against other methods. Later only positives were notified. In April, microbiology implemented Cepheid GeneXpert (Sunnyvale, Ca.). Protocols established changed rapidly. Confusion drove subpar test utilization this created processing errors. Multiple shifts were trained previously and no lag was noted. A back-up, BioFire Torch (Salt Lake City, Utah), was validated. CONCLUSION: After eight weeks, over 900 tests, 800 patients and two systems brought online. Overall, a dedicated white board specific to COVID news was established. The “normalcy” phase has hit.

medical," Anal fissure Overview An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Symptoms Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Causes Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. Diagnosis If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Treatment Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Lifestyle and home remedies Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor.

medical,"The aim of the study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused an increased incidence of complicated appendicitis due to the late presentation when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Summary Background Data. Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies. During the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been a reported delay in the presentation of some urgencies to the emergency hospital departments. Methods. A total of 427 patients who underwent surgical treatment due to suspected acute appendicitis from June 2019 to November 2020 were retrospectively included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: the first (pre-COVID-19) group consisted of patients who had surgery before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic (n = 240), while the second (COVID-19) group consisted of those who were operated during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 187). The primary outcome of the study was to compare the incidence of perforated appendicitis before and during the onset of COVID-19. Results. Overall, 84 patients (19.67%) were diagnosed with perforated appendicitis. We found a weak significance (p=0.085) in the rate of perforated appendicitis between the pre-COVID-19 (17.08%) and the COVID-19 era (22.99%). Conclusions. We did not observe any significant difference in the complications of acute appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a university hospital in Rijeka.

medical,"The response of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to the COVID-19 pandemic was vigorous and effective because it had mature programs in surgical quality and health policy and advocacy, the legacy of decades of work by its officers and leaders and its current executive director, David Hoyt. Hoyt had the foresight to institute a digital communications platform upon which the College collected data for its clinical programs and conducted many of its meetings. Through internet portals, online communities, and social media it broadcasted news and information to the membership. When the global COVID-19 pandemic struck, the College was able to quickly mobilize its leaders and scientific experts to disseminate credible information, recommend protocols to maintain patient and provider safety in operating room environments, provide a rational scheme of prioritization of urgent surgical operations, and a sensible means of resumption of normal surgical practice. As the financial impact of the outbreak on surgical practice became apparent, the ACS represented the interests of surgeons in the White House, Capitol, federal agencies, and governors' mansions and statehouses. In an interview by Steven Wexner, a member of the ACS Board of Regents, Hoyt described the response of the ACS to an unprecedented threat to the surgical care of patients in the country and the world. His story demonstrates the legacy of credibility and professionalism built by decades of principled leadership of generations of officers and Regents of the College, and his own example of effective leadership in crisis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xhnDmZ

medical,"AIMS: (1) To catalogue and map all singing for health and wellbeing groups in the Republic of Ireland (ROI); (2) determine how they prioritise health outcomes; (3) understand what they consider success; and (4) identify gaps in provision. METHODS: A novel mixed-methods survey was distributed electronically through SING Ireland (the Choir Association of Ireland), artsandhealth.ie, and to 2736 potential stakeholders with links to singing for health and wellbeing and singing on social prescription (SSP) from October 2020 to April 2021. Thematic analysis was used to analyse four open-ended survey questions. RESULTS: A total of 185 singing for health and wellbeing groups were identified, with varied representation in each of the ROI’s 26 counties. 35 groups were noted to have links to SSP. Gaps in provision for clinical and individual populations and for SSP were identified. Six themes related to the success of group singing for health and wellbeing programmes were determined: fostering and funding social and community connections; the people and the approach; enjoyment and atmosphere; musical and personal growth, programmatic structure and musical content; and the impact of Covid. CONCLUSION: The first-ever national mapping of group singing for health and wellbeing in the ROI, and one of few internationally, this study may serve as a roadmap for gathering information about existing singing for health and wellbeing provision and identifying geographical and clinical gaps internationally. Recommendations are included for future research to address gaps in provision, explore the feasibility of integrating SSP more widely and for further public health investment.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",p3Thp_

medical,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 in Italy has led to the need to reorganize hospital protocols with a significant risk of interruption to cancer treatment programs. In this report, we will focus on a management model covering the two phases of the COVID-19 emergency, namely lockdown-phase I and post-lockdown-phase II. METHODS: The following steps were taken in the two phases: workload during visits and radiotherapy planning, use of dedicated routes, measures for triage areas, management of suspected and positive COVID-19 cases, personal protective equipment, hospital environments and intra-institutional meetings and tumor board management. Due to the guidelines set out by the Ministry of Health, oncological follow-up visits were interrupted during the lockdown-phase I; consequently, we set about contacting patients by telephone, with laboratory and instrumental exams being viewed via telematics. During the post-lockdown-phase II, the oncological follow-up clinic reopened, with two shifts operating daily. RESULTS: By comparing our radiotherapy activity from March 9 to May 4 2019 with the same period in 2020 during full phase I of the COVID-19 emergency, similar results were achieved. First radiotherapy visits, Simulation Computed Tomography and Linear Accelerator treatments amounted to 123, 137 and 151 in 2019 compared with 121, 135 and 170 in 2020 respectively. There were no cases of COVID-19 positivity recorded either in patients or in healthcare professionals, who were all negative to the swab tests performed. CONCLUSION: During both phases of the COVID-19 emergency, the planned model used in our own experience guaranteed both continuity in radiotherapy treatments whilst neither reducing workload nor interrupting treatment and, as such, it ensured the safety of cancer patients, hospital environments and staff.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",y1mvwN

medical,"Background The incidence of head and neck cancers is increasing, alongside a decrease in associated mortality. Currently, medical and dental practitioners can refer patients to be seen urgently within two weeks. The appropriateness of these referrals has been disputed. In 2020, the Department of Health aims for patients to be given cancer diagnoses within 28 days from referral. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted for all patients referred under the two-week wait pathway in a six-month period. In the first cycle of this audit, one month's worth of urgent referrals were analysed; given the small sample size, very few recommendations could be made. The audit cycle was repeated and it analysed six months' worth of data, which gave a much more representative study. All patients were analysed to see if the 14-day period had been breached. Positive cancer patients were further assessed to see if their diagnosis had been given within 28 days and treatments within 62 days. Results Of the 569 patients seen, there was a positive malignancy diagnostic yield of 7.38%. Nineteen patients breached the 14-day wait. Of the positive patients, 45.2% received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral, and 22.2% of these patients received treatment after 62 days. Conclusion The department performed well despite the high number of referrals. This audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article. Furthermore, this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among GDPs and GMPs. While all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view, this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions. All secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-F4FdC

medical,"Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major challenge worldwide and endovascular revascularization is an important component of treatment that is affected by COVID-19 restrictions. Purpose: Here, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 restriction on angioplasty service and outcome of patients undergoing lower limb angioplasty. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing endovascular revascularisation between August 2018-March 2021 in a UK district general hospital were analysed retrospectively. Indications for angioplasty of all patients were discussed and agreed upon in multi-disciplinary teams. We compared time from referral to angioplasty, patient and procedural characteristics, technical success, peri-procedural complications, and outcome (wound healing, major amputation, target lesion revascularization, death) in patients treated 'before' and after February 2020 (during COVID-19). Results: One hundred nineteen patients were treated 'before' (92% critical limb ischaemia [CLI];60% diabetes mellitus) and 72 were treated 'during COVID-19' (96% CLI;61% diabetes mellitus). While the total monthly number of patients treated did not change, the number of outpatients treated as day cases increased (40% to 72%) and overnight stays for social reasons decreased (16% to 10%). Treatment of hospitalized patients decreased from 44% to 18%. The percentage of outpatients treated at <14 days after referral increased from 39% to 63% and hospitalized patients treated <5 days from 47% to 54%. Neither COVID-19 nor time to procedure affected wound healing (p(log Rank) = 0.451;median time to healing 168±l25 days) and amputation free survival (p(log Rank) = 0.924;median survival 368±l30 days) in all CLI patients significantly. However, amputation-free survival was significantly worse in hospitalized as compared to outpatients (p(log Rank) <0.001;median survival 155±l20 vs 368±l30 days) with similar wound healing in those that survived (p(log Rank) = 0.340;median time to wound healing 168±l25 days). Of note, the known causes of death were sepsis (32%), pneumonia (18%), COVID pneumonia (18%), cardiac (16%) and stroke (8%). Conclusions: Adapting to COVID-19 restriction we maintained a safe and effective angioplasty service while shortening waiting times. Very high mortality rates in patients after hospitalization indicated that CLI need to be treated much earlier and more aggressively to avoid disease progression requiring hospitalization.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ThUqyv

medical,"Hello, I recently traveled up to Mammoth (elevation between 7900 - 8900 ft) for the Memorial Day Weekend. We arrived on Friday evening. I felt fine all day Saturday and Sunday. After going in to bed on Sunday night I was restless and had a hard time sleeping. I started shivering and had chills. I think I started to scare myself and started having some anxiety which was making me feel like I wasn t breathing right - though I know I wasn t really breathless, didn t have shortness of breath nor was my heart rate irregular. I ended up taking my temperature at it was just under 100 degrees (normal for me is in the 97-low 98 degrees). I could tell my temperature rose a bit more as I got really warm then sweaty. I felt very dehydrated and kept drinking a lot of fluids. I was somewhat dizzy and felt a slighly nauseated. I couldn t sleep for most of the night. I took some ibuprofin and finally dosed off around 4 in the morning. I woke up around 6/7 am and didn t feel any better. My fever had come back (still low grade) and then I had a headache and body aches. I did start having some chest tightness and aches in my chest area too - similar to when my asthma acts up. As the morning went on I felt a little bit better but still had a headache, body aches and low grade fever. We left the area around noon and went back home (which is close to sea level). I felt much better still had some of the symptoms. My fever rose to almost 101 during the night (last night) but dropped after taking ibuprofin this morning. I still have had a slight headache but it and the aches have improved. Temperature hasn t risen since the night again. Question - does this sound more like a flu or virus or could it have been altitude sickness? or something else? Some of the symptoms sound like it could have been but not sure since I did have a fever and it came on after 48 hrs of being at that elevation (we slept at the lower elevation).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",yvdLkH

medical,"Abstract Viruses have evolved strategies to evade immunity mediated by antibody and complement. Herpesviruses and coronaviruses encode IgG Fc binding proteins that inhibit IgG activity, enabling the virus or infected cell to escape antibody attack. Herpesviruses, vaccinia virus and HIV-1 have the capacity to interfere with complement, either by incorporation of cellular complement regulatory proteins into the virion envelope or cell membrane, or by expression of viral molecules that mimic functions of complement regulatory proteins. The structure and biological activities of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) glycoproteins gE, gI and gC are described. These glycoproteins protect HSV from immune attack; HSV-1 gE/gI form a complex that binds the Fc domain of IgG while gC is a C3b binding complement regulatory protein, providing a survival advantage to the virusin vitroandin vivoby inhibiting immune functions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",CMpswB

medical,"Objective: To predict SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity on the basis of symptoms and contact history of individuals who attend emergency department (ED). Methods: The data for the study which was of a prospective-methodological type were collected from 503 patients who attended ED of a hospital with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 02 January - 15 March 2021 and were given PCR test. COVID-19 Visual Triage Scale (VTS) and questionnaire were used for collecting data. Distribution of socio-demographic data was interpreted in frequency, percentage. Independent samples t-test and chi-square test were used to compare quantitative data. Cut-off value of the scale was determined. In the study, sensitivity and specificity of the scale were tested through scoring adopted based on the real time PCR test result. Results: According to the PCR test, 67% of the patients were tested negative while 33% of them were positive. According to COVID-19 VTS, 55% of the patients were found to be negative while 45% were found positive. Validation of scale resulted in 0.65 AUC with a 45% sensitivity and 82% specificity using a cut-off value >4. In its comparison with PCR test, the scale was found to detect 93 real positive and 204 real negative patients. Self-reported fever, cough, sore throat, loss of taste and smell and history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case were found to be strong predictors for detecting COVID-19 (p<.05). Conclusions: In the study, sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 VTS were found to be low. However, for COVID-19 and future pandemics, it is supposed to be useful in sorting patients during the early stages of the pandemic where testing facilities are limited and during the times of fluctuation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rfyVfY

The triple-stranded nucleic acid in this biosensor has an extreme dependence on pH, which makes our constructed biosensor reproducible. This is essential for effective large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in areas where resources are currently relatively scarce. Using this pH-induced regenerative biosensor, we detected the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene with a detection limit of 43.70 aM.

medical,"AIMS: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) in the management of heart failure (HF), including telemonitoring, thoracic impedance, implantable pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitors, and cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)‐based sensors, has had varying outcomes in single platform studies. Uncertainty remains regarding the development of single‐centre RPM programs; additionally, no studies examine the effectiveness of dual platform RPM programs for HF. This study describes the implementation and outcomes of a dual platform RPM program for HF at a single centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: An RPM program was developed to include two platforms (e.g. CardioMEMS™ HF System and HeartLogic™ HF Diagnostic). To examine changes within each participant over time, study‐related outcomes including total hospitalizations (TH), total length of stay (TLOS), cardiac hospitalizations (CH), cardiac LOS (CLOS), and cardiac‐related emergency department (ED) visits were compared in two timeframes: 12 months pre‐enrolment and post‐enrolment into RPM. For 141 participants enrolled, there was a significant reduction in the likelihood of experiencing a CH by 19% (0.77 vs. 0.61 events/patient‐year; HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.97, P = 0.03) and a cardiac‐related ED visit by 28% (0.48 vs. 0.34 events/patient‐year; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.55–0.93, P = 0.01). There was also a 51% decrease (SE = 1.41, 95% CI: 2.79–8.38 days, P < 0.001) and 62% decrease (SE = 1.24, 95% CI: 3.35–8.22 days, P < 0.001) in TLOS and CLOS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A dual platform RPM program for HF using structured education, RPM‐capable devices, and alert‐specific medication titration reduces the likelihood of experiencing a cardiac hospitalization and cardiac‐related ED visit in this single‐centre study.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",QzETXZ
medical,"The COVID‐19 emergency has had a dramatic impact on market incomes and income support policies. The lack of timely available data constrains the estimation of the scale and direction of recent changes in the income distribution, which in turn constrain policymakers seeking to monitor such developments. We overcome the lack of data by proposing a dynamic calibrated microsimulation approach to generate counterfactual income distributions as a function of more timely external data than is available in dated income surveys. We combine nowcasting methods using publicly available data and a household income generation model to perform the first calibrated simulation based upon actual data aiming to assess the distributional implications of the COVID‐19 crisis in Ireland. Overall, we find that the crisis had an equalizing real‐time effect for both gross and disposable incomes, notwithstanding the significant hardship experienced by many households.

We propose a novel model that expands on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation by modeling strong dependence among the words in the same document, with user-level topic distributions. We also simultaneously cluster users, removing the need for post-hoc cluster estimation and improving topic estimation by shrinking noisy user-level topic distributions towards typical values.

Concurrently, health care providers and staff are managing their own personalstressors as well as workplace stressors. As stress can negatively affect the patient–provider experience and cognitive function of both individuals, it is imperative to try to uplift the health care environment for all. Part of the healthcare environmental psychology strategy to reduce stress often includes televisions in waiting rooms, cafeterias, and elsewhere, with the intent to distract the viewer and make waiting easier. Although well-intentioned, many select programming which can induce stress (eg, news). In contrast, as positive media can induce desirable changes in mood, it is possible to use it to decrease stress and uplift viewers, including staff.

medical,"PURPOSE: Hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR) is useful to reduce noise in computed tomography (CT) images. However, it often decreases the spatial resolution. The ability of high spatial resolution kernels (harder kernels) to compensate for the decrease in the spatial resolution of hybrid IRs was investigated. METHODS: An elliptic cylindrical phantom simulating an adult abdomen was used. Two types of rod-shaped objects with ~330 and ~130 HU were inserted to simulate contrasts of arteries in CT angiography. Two multi-slice CT systems were used to scan the phantoms with 120 kVp and scan doses of 20 and 10 mGy. The task transfer functions (TTFs) were measured from the circular edges of the rod images. The noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured from the images of the water-only section. The CT images were reconstructed using a filtered back projection (FBP) with baseline kernels and two levels of hybrid IRs with harder kernels. The profiles of the clinical images across the aortic dissection flaps were measured to evaluate actual spatial resolutions. RESULTS: The TTF degradation of each hybrid IR was recovered by the harder kernels, whereas the noise reduction effect was retained, for both the 20 and 10 mGy. The profiles of the dissection flaps for the FBP were maintained by using the harder kernels. Even with the best combination of hybrid IR and harder kernel, the noise level at 10 mGy was not reduced to the level of FBP at 20 mGy, suggesting no capability of a 50% dose reduction while maintaining noise.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",f_Srya

medical,"Inflammation is increased by infection with pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. High levels of inflammatory mediators and infiltration of macrophages into inflammatory lesions were reported in severe inflammatory diseases. Here, the aim of this study was to evaluate an anti-inflammatory activity of di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (1–100 ng/mL) had no effect on viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (100 ng/mL) significantly reduced LPS-induced release of nitric oxide and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. A significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 by LPS stimulation was downregulated by treatment with Dp44mT. Dp44mT blocked activation of nuclear factor-κB by the interruption of IκBα phosphorylation. Dp44mT suppressed the phagocytosis. Furthermore, administration of Dp44mT significantly reduced the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-treated mice without side effects. In conclusion, these results indicate that Dp44mT has an anti-inflammatory activity and may be of therapeutic significant for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Currently, no treatments with robust evidence of clinical benefit exist, and utilization of experimental agents have been recommended by national and international guidelines as a part of clinical studies. METHOD: In this retrospective study, a total of 323 patients severe acute respiratory syndrome due to PCR-documented COVID-19 infection admitted in our unit were included. Patients were categorized into two groups as those who did or did not receive high dose intravenous vitamin C. we examined the effect of high dose intravenous vitamin C administered in addition to other commonly used agents on prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: As compared to patients who did not receive vitamin C, those in the VC group were not significantly different in terms of the length of hospital stay (p = 0.05), re-admission rate (p = 0.943), admission to intensive care, need for advanced oxygen support (p = 0.488), need for advanced medical treatment (p < 0.001), and mortality (p = 0.52).

medical,"In March 2021, Japan is facing a 4th wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent further spread of infection, sera cross-neutralizing activity of patients previously infected with conventional SARS-CoV-2 against novel variants is important but is not firmly established. We investigated the neutralizing potency of 81 COVID-19 patients' sera from 4 waves of pandemic against SARS-CoV-2 variants using their authentic viruses. Most sera had neutralizing activity against all variants, showing similar activity against B.1.1.7 and D614G, but lower activity especially against B.1.351. In the 4th wave, sera-neutralizing activity against B.1.1.7 was significantly higher than that against any other variants, including D614G. The cross-neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was effective against all variants but was potentially weaker for B.1.351.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Jyd0FI
medical,"There is worldwide concern about the rapid spread of the Covid19 (COVID-19) pandemic which now affects almost every country in the world. Generating accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 by testing hundreds of thousands of people per day, and the search for effective therapeutics and vaccines are currently the focus of intense research in large numbers of companies and academic institutions around the world. This review will describe the background, origin, epidemiology, symptoms of COVID-19 infection, and its methods of detection. Because of the rapidly changing news on the development of new therapeutic approaches (many of which have already been discarded), and the constantly breaking news - on a daily basis - about the development of vaccines (there are currently 22 separate vaccine programmes worldwide), we will leave the future therapeutic and vaccination options outside the scope of this review. We will address these topics later, once some clarity has prevailed surrounding the large number of putative therapeutic and vaccination options that are currently being explored and an evidence-based approach can be meaningfully applied to interpreting how patient management, and national epidemiological management, can benefit by these emerging breakthroughs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4Wo6hU
medical,"It is perhaps inevitable that the academic study of learning disabilities is often undertaken by established scholars with little lived experience of the condition. So, what has it been like for someone from outside the academy, with a long career in the arts, who is also the father of a severely learning-disabled young man, to write a book-length history of learning disabilities in culture and society? How is it possible to reconcile such a biological reality with the many caveats about the social construction of the condition? How can we retain a belief in scientific analysis when the categorisation of learning-disabled people seems to have caused as many problems as it solves? Furthermore, how can such an account be attempted when so much of the written record is by people who are placed in positions of power over learning-disabled people and when the true voice of experience is so often silenced, or, like the author's son, silent? The attempt to answer these questions reveals a field rich with contradiction. Despite some advances, much of the social and cultural history of learning disabilities tells a tale of neglect, abandonment and abuse, with confused cultural attitudes too often shaping practice. When the telescope is reversed, however, severe learning disabilities provide us with a kind of Brechtian ""alienation effect"" which reveals the fault lines running through so many progressive movements and helps us to frame them historically, while also challenging assumptions about how those with severe learning disabilities are regarded and can best be given the support and freedom that they need.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zPqrGQ

medical,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures (FF) are associated with corticosteroids which are the mainstay treatment for asthma; however, these bone comorbidities within asthma need to be better described. METHODS: A matched cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD). Adults with an incident asthma code were identified and matched, with up to four randomly selected people without asthma, by age, gender, and practice. Osteoporosis and FF incidence rates were calculated, and Cox regression was performed comparing hazard rates to the general population. We report the impact of age, gender, glucocorticoids, and the risk of specific fractures. RESULTS: Patients with asthma had a higher risk of osteoporosis (aHR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.13-1.23) and were 12% (aHR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16) more likely to sustain FF than the general population. Age modified the effect of asthma on osteoporosis and FF, such that effect to be stronger in younger people (pinteraction <0.0001). Vertebral (aHR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.33-1.48), and forearm-wrist (aHR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.22-1.32) were the sites linked with a larger incidence. A dose-response relationship between oral corticosteroids (OCS) and osteoporosis was observed, whereas the risk of FF increased in those with 6 or more OCS courses per year. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increased the risk of both bone conditions. CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma are more likely to develop osteoporosis or sustain FF than the general population with a particular concern in younger people and those more frequently using OCS and ICS.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dCVrLf

Objective We aim to discuss clinical, immunological features and breast feeding advices among mother-infant pairs. Study design This observational analysis was conducted in a tertiary center located in Wuhan, China. Pregnant patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who delivered during hospitalization were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and serial specimens of the mother-infant pairs were examined, supplemented with follow-ups regarding recovery and breast feeding. Results 14 pregnant patients had live birth and achieved good recovery, four patients continued breast feeding with precautions, no neonatal infection was found. No infants observed developed COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Common maternal symptoms were fever (11/14, 78.1%) and cough (6/14, 42.9%), a pregnancy specific symptom was abnormal fetal movement, noticed in three (21.4%) patients. The mean viral shedding time was nine days (SD 6, range 1-22), SARS- CoV- 2 genome was non-detected in breast milk or maternal vaginal secretions. Immunological assay showed seroconversion of IgM on day eight of onset, IgG on day 28. Both IgM and IgM antibodies to SARS- CoV- 2 are detected in breast milk, cord blood and neonatal serum. Conclusion The study suggested passive acquisition of antibody against SARS- CoV- 2 through breast milk ingestion.

METHODS: We explored correlates of vaccine hesitancy, considering political believes and psychosocial concepts, conducting a non-probability quota-sampled online survey with 1007 Austrians. RESULTS: We identified several important correlates of vaccine hesitancy, ranging from demographics to complex factors such as voting behavior or trust in the government. Among those with hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine, having voted for opposition parties (opp) or not voted (novote) were (95% Confidence Intervall (CI)opp, 1.44-2.95) to 2.25-times (95%CInovote, 1.53-3.30) that of having voted for governing parties. Only 46.2% trusted the Austrian government to provide safe vaccines, and 80.7% requested independent scientific evaluations regarding vaccine safety to increase willingness to vaccine.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Anemia is associated with decreased tissue oxygenation in preterm infants and may contribute to developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We aimed to investigate whether hemoglobin level is associated with intestinal injury, by comparing anemic infants 10 days prior to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with non-anemic controls. METHODS: A nested case–control study in which we matched anemic preterms (gestational age (GA) < 32 weeks) with non-anemic controls (1:1), based on GA, birth weight (BW), and postnatal age. We measured urinary intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, I-FABP, marker for intestinal injury, twice weekly. Simultaneously, we assessed splanchnic oxygen saturation (r(s)SO(2)) and r(s)SO(2) variability. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases and 36 controls were included (median GA 27.6 weeks, BW 1020 grams). Median I-FABP level was higher in cases from 6 days to 24-h before transfusion (median ranging: 4749–8064 pg/ml versus 2194–3751 pg/ml). R(s)SO(2) and r(s)SO(2) variability were lower in cases than controls shortly before transfusion. Hemoglobin levels correlated negatively with r(s)SO(2) and r(s)SO(2) variability in cases, and negatively with I-FABP in cases and controls together. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary I-FABP levels were higher in anemic infants before RBC transfusion than in non-anemic matched controls, suggesting intestinal injury associated with anemia. This may predispose to NEC in some anemic preterm infants. IMPACT: Anemia is a common comorbidity in preterm infants and may lead to impaired splanchnic oxygen saturation and intestinal tissue hypoxia, a proposed mechanism for NEC. Lower hemoglobin level is associated with higher urinary I-FABP levels, a marker for intestinal injury, both in anemic preterm infants and in cases and controls together. Lower splanchnic oxygen saturation and reduction of its variability are associated with higher urinary I-FABP levels in anemic preterm infants before their first RBC transfusion. These results support the hypothesis that anemia in very preterm infants results in intestinal cell injury, which may precede NEC development in some.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sYRi6e
medical,"A stabilization method of pertrochanteric femur fractures is a contentious issue. Here, we assess the feasibility of rapid in silico 2D finite element modeling (FEM) to predict the distribution of stresses arising during the two most often used stabilization methods: gamma nail fixation (GNF) and dynamic hip screw (DHS). The modeling was based on standard pre-surgery radiographs of hip joints of 15 patients with pertrochanteric fractures of type A1, A2, and A3 according to the AO/OTA classification. The FEM showed that the stresses were similar for both GNF and DHS, with the medians ranging between 53–60 MPa and consistently lower for A1 than A3 fractures. Stresses also appeared in the fixation materials being about two-fold higher for GNF. Given similar bone stresses caused by both GNF and DHS but shorter surgery time, less extensive dissection, and faster patient mobilization, we submit that the GNF stabilization appears to be the most optimal system for pertrochanteric fractures. In silico FEM appears a viable perioperative method that helps predict the distribution of compressive stresses after osteosynthesis of pertrochanteric fractures. The promptness of modeling fits well into the rigid time framework of hip fracture surgery and may help optimize the fixation procedure for the best outcome. The study extends the use of FEM in complex orthopedic management. However, further datasets are required to firmly position the FEM in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nHklO3

Results: A total of 114 COVID-19 patients (99 mild, 4 severe, 11 critical) of which 56 (56/114; 49.1%) were male, 58 (58/114; 50.9%) were female with a mean age of 46.05 years. Twenty nine (29/114; 25.44%) patients suffered from chronic diseases. Neutrophils counts in 23.68% (27/114) of patients were abnormally low and abnormally high in 21.05% (24/114). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein levels were abnormally elevated in 76.5% (62/81) and 62.9% (66/105) of patients, respectively. Creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and troponin levels were above the normal range in 7.10% (8/112), 66.7% (10/15), and 100% of patients, respectively. The percentage of patients in which the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired O 2(FiO 2) ratio exceeded 200 was 60%. A total of 91 (91/114; 79.82%) patients displayed severe bilateral pneumonia, 52 (52/114; 45.61%) exhibited ground-glass opacity, and pulmonary consolidation was observed in 4 (3.51%) patients. Differences in shortness of breath, insomnia, inappetence, the procalcitonin (PCT) levels, FiO 2and PaO 2/FiO 2among the three groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).

medical,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical power (MP) is the energy delivered to the respiratory system over time during mechanical ventilation. Our aim was to compare the currently available methods to calculate MP during volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation, comparing different equations with the geometric reference method, to understand whether the easier to use surrogate formulas were suitable for the everyday clinical practice. This would warrant a more widespread use of mechanical power to promote lung protection. METHODS: Forty respiratory failure patients, sedated and paralyzed for clinical reasons, were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation, at two inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L/min), and pressure-controlled ventilation with a similar tidal volume. Mechanical power was computed both with the geometric method, as the area between the inspiratory limb of the airway pressure and the volume, and with two algebraic methods, a comprehensive and a surrogate formula. RESULTS: The bias between the MP computed by the geometric method and by the comprehensive algebraic method during volume-controlled ventilation was respectively 0.053 (0.77, − 0.81) J/min and − 0.4 (0.70, − 1.50) J/min at low and high flows (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.97, p < 0.01). The MP measured and computed by the two methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.94, p < 0.01) with a bias of − 0.0074 (0.91, − 0.93) and − 1.0 (0.45, − 2.52) J/min at high-low flows. During pressure-controlled ventilation, the bias between the MP measured and the one calculated with the comprehensive and simplified methods was correlated (r(2) = 0.81, 0.94, p < 0.01) with mean differences of − 0.001 (2.05, − 2.05) and − 0.81 (2.11, − 0.48) J/min. CONCLUSIONS: Both for volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation, the surrogate formulas approximate the reference method well enough to warrant their use in the everyday clinical practice. Given that these formulas require nothing more than the variables already displayed by the intensive care ventilator, a more widespread use of mechanical power should be encouraged to promote lung protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ay4qAz

She prescribed him amoxicillin (which he has taken many times before.) The next morning, he woke up with  a swollen bottom lip. (it was huge!) We took him to the emergency room, the gave him an epi shot, a dose of benedryl, and changed the antibiotic to Keflex, saying he had developed an allergy to penecillian.  The swelling was gone by the next morning, but that afternoon, he started to swell again.  We called the pediatrician again.  Took him back to the Dr. Office, they agreed with the ER docs diagnosis, and just gave him a steroid, & told us to do the benedryl.  He cleared up, and got better.  The monday morning (Nov 1st), he woke up with another swollen lip!  I gave him bendryl, and by tuesday afternoon it was clear.  He went back to school yesterday, and when we picked him up, his lip had started swelling again!  I am about to go nuts!

medical,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes an enormous threat to all human beings. Via this retrospective study conducted on medical records of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients on admission, we investigate the CT manifestation and clinical and laboratory risk factors associated with progression to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and assessed the association among clinical and laboratory records, CT findings, and epidemiological features. The medical records and radiological CT Features of 236 confirmed COVID-19 patients were reviewed at one public hospital and one respiratory clinic in Quom, from 1 August to 30 September 2020. Results: : Among a total of 236 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 62 were infected with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease and required hospital admission, and 174 were followed up on outpatient bases. A significant difference was verified in the mean age between outpatients and hospitalized groups. The incidences of bilateral lung involvement, consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram sign, and the number of lobe involvement were significantly higher in hospitalized groups. However, only the crazy-paving pattern was significantly associated with an SpO2 level lower than 90%, with clinical sign of cough severity. Our data indicate that this pattern is also significantly associated with inflammatory levels and the presence of this pattern along with SpO2 level lower than 90%, older age, diabetes, on admission are independent risk factors for COVID-19 progression to severe level. Conclusions: : The crazy-paving pattern can predict the severity of COVID-19, which is of great significance for the management and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The clinical factors of aging, male gender, and diabetes, may be risk factors for the crazy-paving pattern, whereas severe coughing is considered to be the most important clinical symptom related to this pattern, and SpO2 level lower than 90%, which is a matter of more severity.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6lXaGy

medical,"The present paper assesses whether the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies can be related to backshoring. It does so by -firstly- investigating the implementation of such technologies by industrial firms with foreign production plants, the experiences and intentions of these firms regarding the location of production activities, and -secondly- by analyzing backshoring cases among them. It finds that backshoring is a rare phenomenon, and it is questionable whether there is a correlation, left alone causality, between the adoption of digital technologies in home-based manufacturing sites and backshoring hitherto. And while the future may hold more backshoring movements in store, they may not be primarily due to the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies at home-based plants. Instead, other (foreign) location-specific factors seem to have greater weight in the decision-making processes around backshoring operations. I.e., deteriorating sales forecasts in offshore places where firms have production activities, increases in institutional uncertainty in such places, rationalization of global production apparatuses, and/or a lack of possibilities to deploy foreign manufacturing activities and output for third markets. Also against the backdrop of events like the outbreak of Covid19 and the uncertainty-raising effect it has on international business, the trade-off between producing off-shore or bringing manufacturing activities back home is not likely to depend on technology adoption levels at home and abroad either.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XELQT4

medical,"In recent years, studying and predicting alternative mobility (e.g., sharing services) patterns in urban environments has become increasingly important as accurate and timely information on current and future vehicle flows can successfully increase the quality and availability of transportation services. This need is aggravated during the current pandemic crisis, which pushes policymakers and private citizens to seek social-distancing compliant urban mobility services, such as electric bikes and scooter sharing offerings. However, predicting the number of incoming and outgoing vehicles for different city areas is challenging due to the nonlinear spatial and temporal dependencies typical of urban mobility patterns. In this work, we propose STREED-Net, a novel deep learning network with a multi-attention (spatial and temporal) mechanism that effectively captures and exploits complex spatial and temporal patterns in mobility data. The results of a thorough experimental analysis using real-life data are reported, indicating that the proposed model improves the state-of-the-art for this task.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",s6B3hP

The purpose of the study was to evaluate advantages of the implementation of biomechanical analysis in the recovery of previously mastered techniques in beach volleyball. Comparison of the efficiency of the recovery of previously mastered techniques was studied on the example of the attack spike. Twelve male university team players participated in this study (age: 20.5 ± 0.72 years;body mass: 79.8± 7.6 kg;height: 186.7 ± 5.49 cm) were divided into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). Personal spike profiles for beach volleyball were used in the experimental group to guide the technique recovery. The spike efficiency was assessed on three most informative parameters: initial ball velocity, hitting the court and hitting the assigned zone. The generalized value of spike efficiency was calculated as the parameters average. The results showed substantial acceleration of skill recovery to the previously archived level both in in seasonal shifts of the experimental group and after the constrained layoffs due to COVID-19 restrictions. © 2021 ACM.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EoH_Ld

medical,"The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada was forced to critically increase its capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this work is to describe the activities promoted by the pharmacist in the care of the critically ill patient in this context. A new organizational structure was designed, analyzing the tasks necessary to make the processes profitable. Two pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out. The physical presence of the pharmacist favored the detection of needs, the availability in time of medications in the unit, including sterile and non-sterile preparations, and coordination with the central pharmacy. In knowledge management, the participation of the pharmacist in the working group for the development of the hospital management protocol COVID-19 stands out. The daily presence in the unit and the joint work with the entire multidisciplinary team demonstrate the value that the pharmacist can bring.

medical,"The uneven morphology and the trapped charges at the surface of the traditionally used supporting substrate-based 2D biosensors produces a scattering effect, which leads to a irregular signals from individually fabricated devices. Though suspended 2D channel material has the potential to overcome scattering effects from the substrates but achieving reliability and selectivity, have been limiting the using of this biosensor technology. Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies. For evaluating the electrical characteristics of suspended MoS2 FET, gating potential was applied through an electrolyte on the suspended MoS2 transistor. This helped in achieved a lower subthreshold swing 70 mV/dec and ON/OFF ratio 107. Later, pH detection was conducted at room temperature, which showed an impressive sensitivity of ~880 by changing 1 unit of pH. We have also successfully shown Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria sensing from the suspended MoS2 transistor by functionalizing dielectric layer with E. coli antibodies. The reported biosensor has shown the ~9% of conductance changes with a lower concentration of E. coli (10 CFU/mL; colony-forming unit per mL) as well as maintain the constant sensitivity in three fabricated devices. The obtained enhancement in the sensitivity of devices and its effect on biomolecules detection can be extened to other biomolecules and this type of architecture has the potential to detect COVID-19 viruses based biomolecules.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-Xo_aU

medical,"BACKGROUND: Prediction models are essential for informing screening, assessing prognosis, and examining options for treatment. This study aimed to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in the Abu Dhabi population. METHODS: This is a mixed retrospective cohort study and case–control study to explore the associated factors of receiving treatment in the community, being hospitalized, or requiring complex hospital care among patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Of 641 patients included, 266 were hospitalized; 135 were hospitalized and either died or required complex care, i.e., required ICU admission, intubation, or oxygen and 131 did not develop severe disease requiring complex care. The third group (“controls”) were 375 patients who were not hospitalized. Logistic regression analyses were used to study predictors of disease severity. RESULTS: Among hospitalized patients older age and low oxygen saturation at admission were the consistent and strongest predictors of an adverse outcome. Risk factors for the death in addition to age and low oxygen saturation were elevated white blood count and low reported physical activity. Chronic kidney disease and diabetes were also associated with more severe disease in logistic regression. The mortality rate among those with less than 30 min per week of physical activity was 4.9%, while the mortality rate was 0.35% for those with physical activity > 30 min at least once a week. The interval from the onset of symptoms to admission and mortality was found to have a significant inverse relationship, with worse survival for shorter intervals. CONCLUSION: Oxygen saturation is an important measure that should be introduced at screening sites and used in the risk assessment of patients with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, an older age was a consistent factor in all adverse outcomes, and other factors, such as low physical activity, elevated WBC, CKD, and DM, were also identified as risk factors.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1_0kkn

medical,"PURPOSE: To construct an auxiliary empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) multi-class classification model for children with bacterial pneumonia using radiomics features based on artificial intelligence and low-dose chest CT images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from children with pathogen-confirmed bacterial pneumonia including Gram-positive bacterial pneumonia (122/389, 31%), Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia (159/389, 41%) and atypical bacterial pneumonia (108/389, 28%) from January 1 to June 30, 2019. Nine machine-learning models were separately evaluated based on radiomics features extracted from CT images; three optimal submodels were constructed and integrated to form a multi-class classification model. RESULTS: We selected five features to develop three radiomics submodels: a Gram-positive model, a Gram-negative model and an atypical model. The comprehensive radiomics model using support vector machine method yielded an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65–0.83] and accuracy (ACC) of 0.58 [sensitivity (SEN), 0.57; specificity (SPE), 0.78] in the training set, and an average AUC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.79) and ACC of 0.54 (SEN, 0.52; SPE, 0.75) in the test set.

medical,"[Image: see text] The paradigmatic disordered protein tau plays an important role in neuronal function and neurodegenerative diseases. To disentangle the factors controlling the balance between functional and disease-associated conformational states, we build a structural ensemble of the tau K18 fragment containing the four pseudorepeat domains involved in both microtubule binding and amyloid fibril formation. We assemble 129-residue-long tau K18 chains with atomic detail from an extensive fragment library constructed with molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce a reweighted hierarchical chain growth (RHCG) algorithm that integrates experimental data reporting on the local structure into the assembly process in a systematic manner. By combining Bayesian ensemble refinement with importance sampling, we obtain well-defined ensembles and overcome the problem of exponentially varying weights in the integrative modeling of long-chain polymeric molecules. The resulting tau K18 ensembles capture nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift and J-coupling measurements. Without further fitting, we achieve very good agreement with measurements of NMR residual dipolar couplings. The good agreement with experimental measures of global structure such as single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies is improved further by ensemble refinement. By comparing wild-type and mutant ensembles, we show that pathogenic single-point P301L, P301S, and P301T mutations shift the population from the turn-like conformations of the functional microtubule-bound state to the extended conformations of disease-associated tau fibrils. RHCG thus provides us with an atomically detailed view of the population equilibrium between functional and aggregation-prone states of tau K18, and demonstrates that global structural characteristics of this intrinsically disordered protein emerge from its local structure.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2AXlGu

During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient’s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus’s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered.

medical," Tetanus Lockjaw Trismus Summary Tetanus is an infection of the nervous system with a type of bacteria that is potentially deadly, called <em>Clostridium tetani (C tetani)</em>. Causes Spores of the bacterium <em>C tetani</em> are found in the soil, and in animal feces and mouth (gastrointestinal tract). In the spore form, <em>C tetani</em> can remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years. You can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores become active bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanus toxin (also known as tetanospasmin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause fractures of the spine. The time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Most cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been properly vaccinated against the disease. Symptoms Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw). The spasms can also affect your chest, neck, back, and abdominal muscles. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos. Sometimes, the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems. Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups. This is called tetany. These are the episodes that can cause fractures and muscle tears. Other symptoms include: Drooling Excessive sweating Fever Hand or foot spasms Irritability Swallowing difficulty Uncontrolled urination or defecation Exams and Tests Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. No specific lab test is available to diagnose tetanus. Tests may be used to rule out meningitis, rabies, strychnine poisoning, and other diseases with similar symptoms. Treatment Treatment may include: Antibiotics Bedrest with a calm environment (dim light, reduced noise, and stable temperature) Medicine to reverse the poison (tetanus immune globulin) Muscle relaxers, such as diazepam Sedatives Surgery to clean the wound and remove the source of the poison (debridement) Breathing support with oxygen, a breathing tube, and a breathing machine may be necessary. Outlook (Prognosis) Without treatment, 1 out of 4 infected people die. The death rate for newborns with untreated tetanus is even higher. With proper treatment, less than 15% of infected people die. Wounds on the head or face seem to be more dangerous than those on other parts of the body. If the person survives the acute illness, recovery is generally complete. Uncorrected episodes of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) caused by muscle spasms in the throat may lead to irreversible brain damage. Possible Complications Complications that may result from tetanus include: Airway obstruction Respiratory arrest Heart failure Pneumonia Damage to muscles Fractures Brain damage due to lack of oxygen during spasms When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider right away if you have an open wound, particularly if: You are injured outdoors. The wound has been in contact with soil. You have not received a tetanus booster (vaccine) within 10 years or you are not sure of your vaccination status. Call for an appointment with your provider if you have never been immunized against tetanus as an adult or child. Also call if your children have not been immunized, or if you are unsure of your tetanus immunization (vaccine) status. Prevention IMMUNIZATION Tetanus is completely preventable by being immunized (vaccinated). Immunization usually protects against tetanus infection for 10 years. In the United States, immunizations begin in infancy with the DTaP series of shots. The DTaP vaccine is a 3-in-1 vaccine that protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Td vaccine or Tdap vaccine is used to maintain immunity in people age 7 and older. Tdap vaccine should be given once, before age 65, as a substitute for Td for those who have not had Tdap. Td boosters are recommended every 10 years starting at age 19. Older teenagers and adults who get injuries, especially puncture-type wounds, should get a tetanus booster if it has been more than 10 years since the last booster. If you have been injured outside or in any way that makes contact with soil likely, contact your provider about your risk of getting a tetanus infection. Injuries and wounds should be thoroughly cleaned right away. If the tissue of the wound is dying, a doctor will need to remove the tissue. You may have heard that you can get tetanus if you are injured by a rusty nail. This is true only if the nail is dirty and has the tetanus bacteria on it. It is the dirt on the nail, not the rust that carries the risk for tetanus. Review Date 12/13/2017 Updated by: Jatin M.

Objective: To analyze the full clinical course and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability in children confirmed with COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea, where rigorous public health interventions have been implemented. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from February 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed. Results: A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = .54). Fourteen children (15%) were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and/or hydroxychloroquine. All recovered, without any fatal cases. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community.

medical,"The media play a key role in promoting public health and influencing debate regarding health issues; however, some topics seem to generate a stronger response in the public, and this may be related to how the media construct and deliver their messages. Mass media coverage of COVID-19 epidemic has been exceptional with more than 180,000 articles published each day in 70 languages from March 8 to April 8, 2020. One may well wonder if this massive media attention ever happened in the past and if it has been finally proven to be beneficial or even just appropriate. Surgical site and implant-related infections represent a substantial part of health care-associated infections; with an estimated overall incidence of 6% post-surgical infection, approximately 18 million new surgical site infections are expected each year globally, with 5 to 10% mortality rate and an astounding economic and social cost.

medical,"Background: The start of 2021 was marked by the initiation of a global vaccination campaign against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Formulating an optimal distribution strategy under social and economic constraints is challenging. Optimal distribution is additionally constrained by the potential emergence of vaccine resistance. Analogous to chronic low-dose antibiotic exposure, recently inoculated individuals who are not yet immune play an outsized role in the emergence of resistance. Classical epidemiological modelling is well suited to explore how the behavior of the inoculated population impacts the total number of infections over the entirety of an epidemic. Methods: A deterministic model of epidemic evolution is analyzed, with seven compartments defined by their relationship to the emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and representing three susceptible populations, three infected populations, and one recovered population. This minimally computationally intensive design enables simulation of epidemics across a broad parameter space. The results are used to identify conditions minimizing the cumulative number of infections. Results: When an escape variant is only modestly less infectious than the originating strain within a naïve population, there exists an optimal rate of vaccine distribution. Exceeding this rate increases the cumulative number of infections due to vaccine escape. Analysis of the model also demonstrates that inoculated individuals play a major role in the mitigation or exacerbation of vaccine-resistant outbreaks. Modulating the rate of host-host contact for the inoculated population by less than an order of magnitude can alter the cumulative number of infections by more than 20%. Conclusions: Mathematical modeling shows that optimization of the vaccination rate and limiting post-vaccination contacts can perceptibly affect the course of an epidemic. The consideration of limitations on post-vaccination contacts remains relevant for the entire duration of any vaccination campaign including the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Q-LAyn

medical,"BACKGROUND: An elevated incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with COVID-19 without traditional risk factors for IPA has been recently reported around the world. This co-infection has been described in patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit. The risk factors for its development are still unclear. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using the COVID-19 registry of the ARMII study group, based in the Centro Médico ABC, a private hospital in Mexico City. We included all patients that required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 12 to June 15, 2020, and excluded patients without serum galactomannan measurements or bronchial secretion cultures. We used the modified definition of IPA proposed by Schauwvlieghe et al for IPA in influenza patients. The control group was formed by patients with ruled-out IPA (negative galactomannan and secretion cultures). We compared both groups to identify risk factors for IPA using the chi-squared test or the Mann-Whitney U test as applicable. RESULTS: Out of a total 239 patients, 54 met the inclusion criteria. We identified 13 patients with IPA (24.07%) that met the definition of IPA (2 with positive cultures and 11 with positive galactomannan) and 41 without IPA. Only three patients with IPA had important comorbidities (COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV). Patients with IPA tended to have a higher median age (64.6 vs 53.59, p=0.075) and a higher serum glucose at their arrival (145 vs 119, p=0.028). All patients with IPA presented to the hospital with ARDS (100% vs 72.5%, p=0.034), but ultimately did not have a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (100% vs 82.93%, p=0.110). There were no statistical significant differences in use of Tocilizumab, use of glucocorticoids, mortality (23.07% vs 17.50%, p=0.563) or length of stay. CONCLUSION: It has been previously described that patients with acute respiratory disease syndrome triggered by viral infection, like the influenza virus, are prone to invasive aspergillosis even in the absence of underlying immunodeficiency. The use of antifungals to prevent aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients should be assessed because of the gravity presented in the patients with this co-infection.

Within the second year I stopped using the laxatives I was being prescribed as I was going to the toilet every day without them something that I was unable to do since I was 15. started having huge bloating but would go away after a few days went to see my GP regarding this and speak to her about being able to feel the threads whilst having intercourse wit my partner and she cut them  for me. the 3rd year of having the coil in caused more problems I hadnt bled for about a year and then all of a sudden I was bleeding for 2 weeks at a time went to see my GP again regarding this and they sent me to see the nurse to check the threads under an examination the nurse could not locate the threads but I had a scan 2 months or so prior to this regarding POCS and when the GP looked at the scan they determined that the coil was visible but advised me that it was fine. I have been in and out of my doctors for the following past 2 years with constant problems with bloating and I was given advice as to stick with it that these where only minor side effects.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital contact tracing apps have become prevalent worldwide in a coordinated effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, their uptake has been low and slow due to privacy concerns, the lack of trust and motivational affordances, and their minimalist design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present a protocol for a systematic review of the main factors, including facilitators and barriers, that influence the adoption of contact tracing apps. METHODS: We searched seven databases, namely, Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed (MEDLINE), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for relevant publications between October 30, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Three authors were involved in removing duplicates, screening, and selection of relevant articles according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether, we retrieved 777 articles from the seven databases. As of May 14, 2021, we have completed the screening process and arrived at 13 eligible articles to be included in the systematic review. We hope to elicit, summarize, and report the main findings in the systematic review article by the end of August 2021. We expect to uncover facilitators and barriers related to app utility, data security, ease of use, and persuasive design that are deemed important to adoption of contact tracing apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the systematic review will help researchers to uncover the gaps in the adoption of contact tracing apps, and decision makers and designers to focus on the principal adoption factors necessary to create better and more effective contact tracing apps.

medical,"BACKGROUND Patients who have chronic pain with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) (CPD) often have difficulty taking oral medication and, as such, alter their medications by crushing or chewing in an attempt to make it easier to swallow. Such manipulation of currently marketed, extended-release (ER) opioid analgesics can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the formulations, resulting in poor treatment outcome or serious adverse events. There is an unmet medical need for oral ER opioid formulations suitable for patients with CPD. OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of this study were to conduct in vitro studies to evaluate alternate means of administration of a new, extended-release (ER), abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone for patients with CPD. Specifically, these studies investigated the in vitro equivalence of drug release rates from Oxycodone DETERx® ER intact capsules (control condition) and administration via alternate modes-opening the capsule and sprinkling the microspheres onto soft foods or administration through enteral tubes. Secondary objectives were to compare alternate modes of administration of Oxycodone DETERx® to a commercially available ER-morphine product. METHODS Soft food study: Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres were sprinkled onto and mixed with several soft foods (ie, applesauce, vanilla pudding, strawberry jam, yogurt, and vanilla ice cream); the effect of drug contact time (0, 30, and 60 minutes) on drug release was studied. Enteral tube study: Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres were administered through varying sizes of nasogastric (10 and 12 Fr.) tubes and a 16 Fr. gastrostomy tube using 5 different delivery vehicles (ie, water, liquid nutritional feeds [Jevity®, Ensure®], and milk [whole milk and 2% milk]). Drug release rate was characterized using a standard in vitro dissolution methodology; dissolution of intact Oxycodone DETERx® capsules served as the control for both the soft food and enteral tube studies. Oxycodone concentration was measured using a standardized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Similarity factor (f2) analysis was used to compare similarity of the dissolution profiles of test and control conditions. RESULTS The mean dissolution profile of Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres sprinkled onto and mixed with each of the soft foods were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Study drug-food contact time did not impact dissolution profiles. The dissolution data obtained from Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres passed through enteral feeding tubes of varying sizes were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Unlike a marketed morphine sulfate ER pellet formulation, Oxycodone DETERx® did not clog any of the studied enteral tubes. CONCLUSION A new ER, abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone can be administered by sprinkling onto soft food without affecting the drug release profile of the formulation. The formulation can also be administered directly via enteral tubes without affecting drug release and without clogging enteral tubes. Oxycodone DETERx® may offer physicians and patients with CPD an alternate treatment option, especially in those patients who have dysphagia or an aversion to swallowing monolithic tablet/capsule formulations and for whom analgesic patches or other opioid formulations are not a viable therapeutic option.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",CCKNEw

medical,"The positive association of HSD11B1 gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetic conditions has been revealed. In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of the patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza Glabra) is a competitive inhibitor of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11ß-HSD1) enzyme and has been traditionally reported as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, anti-thirst, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic agent. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of participants with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. The study was performed using diabetic patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters were measured using standard diagnostic tools. Fourteen patients were divided into two groups by simple randomization, Licorice group (treated with 750 mg licorice/day for three weeks), and placebo group (treated with 750 mg placebo/day for three weeks). Investigations were repeated at the end of three weeks. Licorice showed a significant reduction in serum insulin levels (p = 0.03). There was no significant change in any other clinical parameters either by licorice or placebo. Conclusively, licorice moderately improves serum insulin levels in patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. From our pilot study, the safety of licorice is confirmed at a dose of 750 mg/day. However, the study can be repeated at a higher dose to show its effectiveness and safety.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DbD-qI

The current review study has investigated the key input, process, and output indicators that are commonly used in measuring the technical efficiency of the hospital to promote the accuracy of the results. Methods: To conduct this systematic review, the electronic resources and databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Ovid, Proquest, Google Scholar, and reference lists of the selected articles were used for searching articles between 2010 and 2019. After in-depth reviews based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, among 1,537 studies, 144 articles were selected for the final assessment. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist was used for evaluating the quality of the articles. The main findings of studies have been extracted using content analysis. Results: After the final analysis, the Context/Input indicators that were commonly considered by studies in analyzing hospital technical efficiency include different variables related to Hospital Capacity, Structure, Characteristics, Market concentration, and Costs. The Process/Throughput indicators include different variables related to Hospital Activity or services-oriented process Indicators, Hospital Quality-oriented process indicators, and Hospital Educational processes. Finally, the Output/Outcome indicators include different variables related to Hospital Activity-related output variables and Quality-related output/outcomes variables. Conclusion: This study has identified that it is necessary to mix and assess a set of input, process, and output indicators of the hospital with both quantitative and qualitative indicators for measuring the technical efficiency of hospitals comprehensively.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2kBaKk

For evaluation of this recommendation, time courses of glycemic changes following transition from a very-low-carbohydrate (VLC) to high-carbohydrate diet were assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After achieving a weight loss target of 15% (±3%) on the run-in VLC diet, participants (18–50 years old, BMI ≥27 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned for 10 weeks to one of three isoenergetic diets: VLC (5% carbohydrate and 77% fat); high carbohydrate, high starch (HC-Starch) (57% carbohydrate and 25% fat, including 20% refined grains); and high carbohydrate, high sugar (HC-Sugar) (57% carbohydrate and 25% fat, including 20% sugar). CGM was done throughout the trial (n = 64) and OGTT at start and end (n = 41). All food was prepared in a metabolic kitchen and consumed under observation. RESULTS: Glucose metrics continued to decline after week 1 in the HC-Starch and HC-Sugar groups (P < 0.05) but not VLC. During weeks 2–5, fasting and 2-h glucose (millimoles per liter per week) decreased in HC-Starch (fasting −0.10, P = 0.001; 2 h −0.10, P = 0.04). During weeks 6–9, 2-h glucose decreased in HC-Starch (−0.07, P = 0.01) and fasting and 2-h glucose decreased in HC-Sugar (fasting −0.09, P = 0.001; 2 h −0.09, P = 0.003). The number of participants with abnormal glucose tolerance by OGTT remained 10 (of 16) in VLC at start and end but decreased from 17 to 9 (of 25) in both high-carbohydrate groups. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological adaptation from a low- to high-carbohydrate diet may require many weeks, with implications for the accuracy of diabetes tests, interpretation of macronutrient trials, and risks of periodic planned deviations from a VLC diet.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pO25Ci

medical,"Vulnerable populations have been identified as having higher infection rates and poorer COVID-19-related outcomes, likely due to their inability to readily access primary care, follow public health directives, and adhere to self-isolation guidelines. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care services have adopted new digital solutions, which rely on phone and internet connectivity. However, persons who are digitally inaccessible, such as those experiencing poverty or homelessness, are often unable to use these services. In response to this newly highlighted social disparity known as ""digital health inequity,"" emergency physicians at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, initiated a program called PHONE-CONNECT (Phones for Healthier Ontarians iN EDs - COvid NEeds met by Cellular Telephone). This novel approach attempts to improve patients' access to health care, information, and social services, as well as improve their ability to adhere to public health directives (social isolation and contact tracing). Although similar programs addressing the same emerging issues have been recently described in the media, this is the first time phones have been provided as a health care intervention in an emergency department.

medical,"Q:A 9-hour-old newborn female is found in the newborn nursery with a diffuse swelling of the scalp not present at birth. The child was born at 38 weeks of gestation to a 28-year-old gravida 3. The mother went into spontaneous labor, but the delivery was complicated by a prolonged second stage of labor. A vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery was eventually performed. The child’s Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia in the mother which was well-controlled throughout the pregnancy. On physical exam, the child appears to be in mild distress and has a 4x5 cm ecchymotic area of swelling over the bilateral parietal bones. Serial assessments of the child’s head circumference over the next 12 hours show no change in the size of the swelling.

medical,"The research proposed in this article presents a novel improved version of the widely adopted firefly algorithm and its application for tuning and optimising XGBoost classifier hyper-parameters for network intrusion detection. One of the greatest issues in the domain of network intrusion detection systems are relatively high false positives and false negatives rates. In the proposed study, by using XGBoost classifier optimised with improved firefly algorithm, this challenge is addressed. Based on the established practice from the modern literature, the proposed improved firefly algorithm was first validated on 28 well-known CEC2013 benchmark instances a comparative analysis with the original firefly algorithm and other state-of-the-art metaheuristics was conducted. Afterwards, the devised method was adopted and tested for XGBoost hyper-parameters optimisation and the tuned classifier was tested on the widely used benchmarking NSL-KDD dataset and more recent USNW-NB15 dataset for network intrusion detection. Obtained experimental results prove that the proposed metaheuristics has significant potential in tackling machine learning hyper-parameters optimisation challenge and that it can be used for improving classification accuracy and average precision of network intrusion detection systems.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Hk1Z6F

medical,"Vaccination programs are implemented in poultry farms to limit outbreaks and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which is a substantial economic burden in the poultry industry. Immune correlates, used to predict vaccine efficacy, have proved difficult to find for IBV-vaccine-induced protection. To find correlates of IBV-vaccine-induced protection, hence, we employed a flow cytometric assay to quantify peripheral leucocyte subsets and expression of cell surface markers of six different non-vaccinated and vaccinated Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes. Non-vaccinated and vaccinated MHC haplotypes presented differential leucocyte composition and IBV viral load. A strong effect of MHC-B, but not vaccination, on several leucocyte subsets resulted in positive correlations with IBV viral load based on MHC haplotype ranking. In addition, a strong effect of MHC-B and vaccination on monocyte MHC-II expression showed that animals with highest monocyte MHC-II expression had weakest vaccine-induced protection. In conclusion, we found several interesting MHC-B related immune correlates of protection and that flow cytometric analysis can be employed to study correlates of IBV-vaccine-induced protection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",of7s9o

medical,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric cardiac surgery, perioperative management has evolved from slow weaning of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit to “ultra‐fast‐track” anesthesia with early extubation (EE) in theater to promote a faster recovery. The strategy of EE has not been assessed in adults with congenital heart disease, a growing population of patients who often require surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collected retrospectively on all patients >16 years of age who underwent adult congenital heart surgery in our tertiary center between December 2012 and January 2020. Coarsened exact matching was performed for relevant baseline variables. Overall, 711 procedures were performed: 133 (18.7%) patients underwent EE and 578 (81.3%) patients received conventional extubation. After matching, patients who received EE required less inotropic or vasopressor support in the early postoperative period (median Vasoactive‐inotropic score 0.5 [0.0–2.0] versus 2.0 [0.0–3.5]; P<0.0001) and had a lower total net fluid balance than patients after conventional extubation (1168±723 versus 847±733 mL; P=0.0002). The overall reintubation rate was low at 0.3%. EE was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative length of stay in higher dependency care units before a “step‐down” to ward‐based care (48 [45–50] versus 50 [47–69] hours; P=0.004). Lower combined intensive care unit and high dependency unit costs were incurred by patients who received EE compared with patients who received conventional extubation (£3949 [3430–4222] versus £4166 [3893–5603]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, EE is associated with a reduced need for postoperative hemodynamic support, a shorter intensive care unit stay, and lower health‐care‐related costs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UmJ6MZ
medical,"INTRODUCTION: Teaching in palliative care (PC) is an important component of medical education. Yet, studies in many countries document a fragmented and inconsistent approach to PC teaching. The goal of this study is to assess PC education, experience, and comfort levels in providing end-of-life care in recently graduated medical students. METHODS: A survey was distributed to medical student applicants to residency programs at a large academic medical center in the United Arab Emirates. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate variable frequencies. RESULTS: Of 226 surveys, 183 were completed (80.7% response). Over half of respondents (104/183, 56.8%) did not receive any formal PC education or training in medical school. General introduction to PC (64%), pain management (68%), and non-pain symptom management (56%) were the most common topics. Only 13% (24/183) of medical students participated in PC rotations. Only 25% of participants (46/183) reported assessment of PC knowledge or skills. Gender differences were noted, with women more comfortable discussing prognosis (Pearson Chi-square value 8.67, df 3, p < 0.013) and assessing decision-making capacity (Pearson Chi-square value 15.02, df 3, p < 0.005). Few students expressed comfort with any aspect of PC. The majority of respondents (174/183, 95%) felt that it is important to receive PC education in medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Most newly graduated medical students reported limited education in PC, with minimal clinical experience. The vast majority described a lack of comfort in providing care for dying patients and their families. Educational reform is necessary to embed PC knowledge and skills into medical school curricula.

medical,"Faith in the legitimating power of the live hearing or trial performed at the place of justice is at least as old as the Iliad. In public courtrooms, litigants appear together, evidence is presented, and decisions are openly and formally pronounced. The bedrock belief in the importance of the courtroom is rooted in common law, constitutional guarantees, and venerated tradition, as well as in folk knowledge. Courtrooms are widely believed to imbue adjudication with “a mystique of authenticity and legitimacy.” The covid-19 pandemic, however, by compelling legal systems throughout the world to turn from physical courtrooms to virtual ones, disrupts and calls into question longstanding assumptions about the conditions essential for the delivery of justice. These questions are not merely tangential – they implicate many of the core beliefs undergirding the U.S. system of justice, including the whole notion of “a day in court” as the promise of a synchronous, physically situated event with a live audience. Rather than regard virtual courts as just an unfortunate expedient, temporary or not, we use them as an occasion to reflect on the essential goals of the justice system, and to re-examine courtroom practices in light of those goals. We draw on social science to help identify what can be justified after the myths are pared away. Focusing on three interrelated aspects of traditional courts – the display and interpretation of demeanor evidence;the courtroom as a physical site of justice;and the presence of the public – we prompt a reassessment of what our legal culture should value most in courtroom adjudication and what we are willing to trade off to achieve it.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",MeJWQ2

medical,"INTRODUCTION Several psychiatric and somatic medications are assumed to improve COVID-19-symptoms. These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants as well as anticoagulants, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS)-inhibitors for somatic comorbid conditions. All these agents may reduce the hyperinflammatory response to SARS/CoV-2 or the related negative cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes. METHODS In a retrospective longitudinal, multi-center inpatient study, we sought to explore the influence of psychiatric medications on COVID-19, comprising the period from diagnosing SARS/CoV-2-infection via PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) up to the next 21 days. Ninety-six psychiatric inpatients (mean age [SD] 65.5 (20.1), 54% females) were included. The primary outcome was the COVID-19-duration. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity and the presence of residual symptoms. RESULTS COVID-19-related symptoms emerged in 60 (62.5%) patients, lasting 6.5 days on average. Six (6.3%) 56-95 years old patients died from or with COVID-19. COVID-19-duration and residual symptom-presence (n=22, 18%) were not significantly related to any substance. Respiratory and neuro-psychiatric symptom-load was significantly and negatively related to prescription of antidepressants and anticoagulants, respectively. Fatigue was negatively and positively related to RAAS-inhibitors and proton-pump-inhibitors, respectively. These significant relationships disappeared with p-value adjustment owed to multiple testing. The mean total psychiatric burden was not worsened across the study. DISCUSSION None of the tested medications was significantly associated with the COVID-19-duration and -severity up to the end of post-diagnosing week 3. However, there were a few biologically plausible and promising relationships with antidepressants, anticoagulants, and RAAS-inhibitors before p-value adjustment. These should encourage larger and prospective studies to re-evaluate the influence of somatic and psychiatric routine medications on COVID-19-related health outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1pncB3

medical,"INTRODUCTION The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most widely used protocol for activating a stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and other stress-mediating systems. A number of variants of the TSST exist, including ones for children, groups, and virtual reality. All of these versions, though, require in-person assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person assessment impossible or extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. The purpose of this study was to validate a completely remote, online, version of the TSST for children. METHOD A sample of 68 (27 female) 15- and 16-year old participants were administered the TSST-Online (TSST-OL) during the late afternoon hours (3-6 p.m. start time). The participants, judges (one male, one female), and experimenter (female) all joined the assessment from their own homes via the online platform, ZOOM™. Two sessions were conducted, one to obtain consent, explain procedures, work with the family to arrange the computer and room set-up for the TSST-OL and one within two weeks to conduct the procedure. The participants were trained to take their own saliva samples and a saliva sampling kit was mailed to the home in between the first and second session. The samples were then mailed to the researchers within a day of collection. The participant was observed during saliva collection to determine correct procedures were followed. Salivary cortisol, salivary α-amylase and self-reports of stress were measured multiple times over the second session. RESULTS rmANOVAs yielded a significant effect of trials, for cortisol, F(1.37,90.46) = 15.13, p = .001, sAA, F(2.75,146.68) = 6.91, p = .001, and self-rated stress, F(3.43,222.69) = 118.73, p = .001. There were no significant sex by trials interactions for any measure, although females reported more stress than males, F(1,65) = 9.14, p = .004. For cortisol, from baseline to expected peak (30 min after the onset of speech preparation), the Cohen's effect size was dz = 0.57. Using 1.5 nmol/l (or 0.54 μg/dl) as the criterion for a response (Miller, Plessow, Kirschaum, & Stalder, 2013), 63% of the participants produced a significant increase in cortisol. CONCLUSIONS The responses to the TSST-OL are consistent with in-person responses among children and adolescents (see recent meta-analysis (Seddon et al., 2020). The protocol is a viable way of assessing reactivity of the HPA axis and other stress systems without needing to bring the participant into the research laboratory. This method will be useful during periods of widespread infection. It should also work to study populations who all live too far from the research laboratory to be assessed in person.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",punpwk

medical,"BACKGROUND Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH). PURPOSE To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults. (PROSPERO: CRD42020153753). DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged. LIMITATIONS Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available. CONCLUSION Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

We investigated organ dysfunction associated with changing serum SDC-1 levels for early detection of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. To evaluate the effect of SDC-1 on laboratory parameters measured the day after SDC-1 measurement with consideration for repeated measures, linear mixed effects models were constructed with each parameter as an outcome variable. A total of 94 patients were enrolled, and 831 samples were obtained. Analysis using mixed effects models for repeated measures with adjustment for age and sex showed that serum SDC-1 levels measured the day before significantly affected several outcomes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), antithrombin III, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. Moreover, serum SDC-1 levels of the prior day significantly modified the effect between time and several outcomes, including AST, ALT, CRE, and BUN. Additionally, increasing serum SDC-1 level was a significant risk factor for mortality. Serum SDC-1 may be a useful biomarker for daily monitoring to detect early signs of kidney, liver and coagulation system dysfunction, and may be an important risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Pk7DJ9

The seroprevalence of IDV was 87.2% (95% CI: 24–100%) in camels, 9.3% (95% CI: 0–24%) in cattle, 2.2% (95% CI: 0–4%) in small ruminants and 0.0% (95% CI: 0–2%) in pigs. In pigs, H1N1 and H1N1pdm09 IAVs were commonly detected. Notably, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was also detected in pigs. Other subtypes detected serologically and/or virologically included H3N8 and H7N7 in equids, H1N1, and H3N8 and H5N1 in dogs and cats. Furthermore, various wildlife animals were exposed to different IAV subtypes. For prudent mitigation of influenza epizootics and possible human infections, influenza surveillance efforts in Africa should not neglect non-human mammalian hosts. The impact of IAV and IDV in non-human mammalian hosts in Africa deserves further investigation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uvIvPA

medical,"BACKGROUND: Diaphragm dysfunction is highly prevalent in mechanically ventilated patients. Recent work showed that changes in diaphragm shear modulus (ΔSMdi) assessed using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) are strongly related to changes in Pdi (ΔPdi) in healthy subjects. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between ΔSMdi and ΔPdi in mechanically ventilated patients, and whether ΔSMdi is responsive to change in respiratory load when varying the ventilator settings. METHODS: A prospective, monocentric study was conducted in a 15-bed ICU. Patients were included if they met the readiness-to-wean criteria. Pdi was continuously monitored using a double-balloon feeding catheter orally introduced. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged using a linear transducer (SL10-2, Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, France). Ultrasound recordings were performed under various pressure support settings and during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). A breath-by-breath analysis was performed, allowing the direct comparison between ΔPdi and ΔSMdi. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) were used to investigate within-individual relationships between variables, and repeated measure correlations (R) were used for determining overall relationships between variables. Linear mixed models were used to compare breathing indices across the conditions of ventilation. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included and 930 respiratory cycles were analyzed. Twenty-five were considered for the analysis. A significant correlation was found between ΔPdi and ΔSMdi (R = 0.45, 95% CIs [0.35 0.54], p < 0.001). Individual correlation displays a significant correlation in 8 patients out of 25 (r = 0.55–0.86, all p < 0.05, versus r = − 0.43–0.52, all p > 0.06). Changing the condition of ventilation similarly affected ΔPdi and ΔSMdi. Patients in which ΔPdi–ΔSMdi correlation was non-significant had a faster respiratory rate as compared to that of patient with a significant ΔPdi–ΔSMdi relationship (median (Q1–Q3), 25 (18–33) vs. 21 (15–26) breaths.min(−1), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ultrasound SWE may be a promising surrogate to Pdi in mechanically ventilated patients. Respiratory rate appears to negatively impact SMdi measurement. Technological developments are needed to generalize this method in tachypneic patients.

medical,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is the most common infectious agent in humans, and infects approximately 10–20% of the world’s population, resulting in 3–5 million hospitalizations per year. A scientific literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) “Influenza A H1N1” and “Genetic susceptibility”. Due to the amount of information and evidence about genetic susceptibility generated from the studies carried out in the last influenza A H1N1 pandemic, studies published between January 2009 to May 2020 were considered; 119 papers were found. Several pathways are involved in the host defense against IAV infection (innate immune response, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, complement activation, and HLA molecules participating in viral antigen presentation). On the other hand, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a type of variation involving the change of a single base pair that can mean that encoded proteins do not carry out their functions properly, allowing higher viral replication and abnormal host response to infection, such as a cytokine storm. Some of the most studied SNPs associated with IAV infection genetic susceptibility are located in the FCGR2A, C1QBP, CD55, and RPAIN genes, affecting host immune responses through abnormal complement activation. Also, SNPs in IFITM3 (which participates in endosomes and lysosomes fusion) represent some of the most critical polymorphisms associated with IAV infection, suggesting an ineffective virus clearance. Regarding inflammatory response genes, single nucleotide variants in IL1B, TNF, LTA IL17A, IL8, IL6, IRAK2, PIK3CG, and HLA complex are associated with altered phenotype in pro-inflammatory molecules, participating in IAV infection and the severest form of the disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",c345nO

medical,"There is accumulating evidence that COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state. Reports of thrombotic events and autopsy findings of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy [1] in patients with COVID-19 are rising. Bompard et al. recently reported a cohort study of 137 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in which retrospective review of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans demonstrated a cumulative incidence of pulmonary emboli (PE) of 24% overall and 50% in intensive care [2]. Although it was initially thought that insidious venous thromboembolic events (VTE) were mainly confined to ventilated patients [3], we now understand thrombotic risk to be a wider problem in COVID-19. An overexuberant host inflammatory response, in selected patients with severe COVID-19, may contribute to the high mortality. We recently recommended screening for virally-driven hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and proposed that immunomodulation in this subgroup of patients, may improve outcomes [4]. There are several ongoing, randomised controlled trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in severe COVID-19 (table 1). JAKi have a purported advantage over other immunomodulatory strategies in COVID-19, as they may exert dual anti-inflammatory (blockade of multiple, pro-inflammatory cytokines simultaneously) and anti-viral effects (impeding cellular viral endocytosis [5, 6]) and have convenient oral administration, with relatively short half-lives. JAKi may interrupt the signalling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation, including interleukin (IL)-6, which has been the focus of several clinical trials in COVID-19. JAKi may also inhibit the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; baricitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor), is a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated viral endocytosis [5]. We recommend vigilance to the potentially increased thrombotic risk associated with JAKi, given the hypercoagulability of COVID-19 and our recent thromboprophylaxis recommendations for all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 [7].",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cBOv2b

In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are deliberately disregarded or ignored by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 617 participants took part in the online survey and answered several questions related to socio-demographic variables, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation, intellectual curiosity, trust in science, COVID-19 risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p <.001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",l9eqzI

medical,"Social stigma is the spoilation of the social image of an individual, which leads to the social disapproval of the individual by the community. Patients of many diseases like HIV, deafness, and reproductive disorders often face social disproval. Head & neck cancer survivors perceived stigma due to the mutilation that occurred after surgical treatment procedures. The novel coronavirus is a recently emerged zoonotic viral agent that affects the respiratory system of humans. Following its outbreak from the Wuhan city of China, the COVID-19 spreaded fiercely around the globe, forming a pandemic. Since COVID-19 is a contagious disease with no available treatment, social distancing is considered as the best strategy to prevent the geometric spread of infection. With the social distancing model, the head & neck cancer survivors along with the various other stakeholders perceived stigma being a high-risk group for COVID-19 infection. As the pool of caregivers is diminished due to pandemic, head & neck cancer survivors face increased social isolation and perceived stigma in asking for help from relatives. At the time of the pandemic, social support is critical to fighting against the disease. Social distancing should be maintained along with communication with the patients through calls, text, and online social platforms. It is not wise to stigmatize disease as, in that case, patients who are infected with the disease will try to hide it and avoid seeking medical care. With the promotion of social distancing, it is crucial to convey awareness regarding not to stigmatize the disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RYCj49

medical,"Context : Quebec's ""medical aid in dying"" (MAID) is a medical intervention mostly practiced in palliative care units. MAID results from a deep revolution within Quebec's ethics regarding end-of-life care. However, there is a lack of empirical studies regarding nursing practice within the context of MAID.Aim : To conduct a literature review of legal and scientific data, as well as data from the media, related to the patient experience of nursing practices in palliative care for patients in Quebec who have requested MAID.Methodology : Burn, Grove, and Sutherland's methodology allowed us to extract and analyze six empirical studies from the CINAHL database. We also analyzed 17 media articles and one legal paper that documents the legalization of MAID in Quebec.Results : There has been a strict law governing MAID since 2015, but some major social events and issues have recently allowed for the expansion of the practice. The literature review allowed us to identify two themes : 1). the nature of nursing practice within MAID, and 2). the need for nursing education that addresses the complex aspects of MAID.Discussion and conclusion : We discuss the effects of the domination of the biomedical narrative on MAID and the collapse of Quebec's health system, which both negatively impact nursing practice in the context of MAID.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",SglMzI

medical,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",VojtXS

As social distancing and stay-at-home orders came into effect, many turned to social media for socializing. This increase in social media usage has made it a prime vehicle for the spreading of misinformation. This paper presents a mechanism to detect COVID-19 health-related misinformation in social media following an interdisciplinary approach. Leveraging social psychology as a foundation and existing misinformation frameworks, we defined misinformation themes and associated keywords incorporated into the misinformation detection mechanism using applied machine learning techniques. Next, using the Twitter dataset, we explored the performance of the proposed methodology using multiple state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Our method shows promising results with at most 78% accuracy in classifying health-related misinformation versus true information using uni-gram-based NLP feature generations from tweets and the Decision Tree classifier.

medical,"Background and objective The recent pandemic due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a major concern for the people and governments across the world due to its impact on individuals as well as on public health. The infectiousness and the quick spread across the world make it an important event in everyone’s life, often evoking fear. Our study aims at assessing the overall knowledge and perceptions, and identifying the trusted sources of information for both the general public and healthcare personnel. Materials and methods This is a questionnaire-based survey taken by a total of 1,246 respondents, out of which 744 belonged to the healthcare personnel and 502 were laypersons/general public. There were two different questionnaires for both groups. The questions were framed using information from the World Health Organization (WHO), UpToDate, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Center for Disease Control (CDC), National Institute of Health (NIH), and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) website resources. The questions assessed awareness, attitude, and possible practices towards ensuring safety for themselves as well as breaking the chain of transmission. A convenient sampling method was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics [mean(SD), frequency(%)] were used to portray the characteristics of the participants as well as their awareness, sources of information, attitudes, and practices related to SARS-CoV-2. Results The majority (94.3%) of the respondents were Indians. About 80% of the healthcare professionals and 82% of the general public were worried about being infected. Various websites such as ICMR, WHO, CDC, etc., were a major source of information for the healthcare professional while the general public relied on television. Almost 98% of healthcare professionals and 97% of the general public, respectively, identified ‘Difficulty in breathing” as the main symptom. More than 90% of the respondents in both groups knew and practiced different precautionary measures.

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a well-known invasive pest that feeds on plant and fruit tissues. Despite numerous studies on egg parasitoids of H. halys, the natural enemies of the nymphs and adults remain poorly known. In this paper, we surveyed the parasitoids of adult H. halys by collecting overwintering H. halys populations. Our results showed that Pentatomophaga latifascia (Diptera: Tachinidae) had laid eggs on the surface of adult H. halys, and the hatched larvae of P. latifascia then penetrated the host body and fed internally to complete their development. The average parasitism rate of P. latifascia on H. halys was 2.42%. These results add an important piece of knowledge about the natural enemy community attacking H. halys in its native range and may have useful implications for biological control in the newly invaded areas. ABSTRACT: Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a serious pest in agriculture and forests, as both adults and nymphs feed by piercing the surface of the plant and fruit tissues, causing damage. The eggs of H. halys are commonly attacked by parasitoids, however, the nymph and the adult are rarely attacked by natural enemies. We surveyed the parasitoids of adult H. halys by collecting samples from overwintering populations at three different locations and checked their body surfaces for the presence of tachinid eggs. Any host adults carrying tachinid eggs were reared in a cage for further species identification. We found that the eggs of Pentatomophaga latifascia (Villeneuve) (Diptera: Tachinidae) were laid on the surface of H. halys, and the hatched larvae penetrated the host body and fed internally to develop. The last larval instar emerged from the host to develop into pupae, killing the host in the process. According to the field survey, the average parasitism of H. halys by P. latifascia was 2.42%. The parasitoids of adult H. halys in their native range have so far been little studied and may provide a complementary component of egg parasitoids for biological control against H. halys in invaded areas.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",aLdNww

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution of the national vaccination programme in Norway and how changes in national policy informed by risk and equity shaped international vaccine debates, public trust and vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Documentary analysis of publicly available statistics, government documents and media sources. RESULTS: Process equity founded on social solidarity was central to the approach taken to vaccination in Norway but within the context of a very low level of COVID-19 Infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of Norway with very low levels of infection, the risks associated with vaccine side effects were of a similar order to the risk of infection which led to an early decision to exclude the AstraZeneca vaccine and limit access to the Janssen vaccine. Public trust in the way the state managed the changes in the vaccination programme resulted in very limited public resistance to the vaccine programme, high levels of vaccine uptake and an acceptance of delays associated with the exclusion of two approved vaccines.

medical,"PURPOSE Little is presently known on the impact of device type for Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation/mucopexy (DGHAL) or circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy (CSH) when a surgical treatment is considered for hemorrhoidal disease (HD). In this study, we aimed to compare the outcome in terms of adverse events and recurrence rate, of patients included in the multicenter LigaLongo RCT ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01240772) according to the type of devices used. METHODS In the DGHAL arm (N = 193), the procedure was done with transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD)™ (THD, Correggio, Italy) (104 patients) and with HAL-RAR™ (Agency for Medical Innovations (AMI) GmbH, Feldkirch, Austria) (89 patients). In the CSH arm (N = 184), procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH)-03™ (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati OH) and hemorrhoidopexy and prolapse (HEM)™ (Covidien, Inc.) staplers were used in respectively 106 and 78 cases. Surgery-related morbidity at 90 postoperative days (POD) based on the Clavien-Dindo procedure-related complication score and clinical outcome in terms of recurrence and reoperation rate at 12 postoperative months (POM) was collected. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were randomized according to HD grade. In the DGHAL arm, the number of ligations and mucopexies was higher in the AMI group (p < 0.0001); at 90 POD, the overall morbidity was similar between the two groups. In the CSH arm, donut sizes were similar; at 90 POD, the PPH group had a higher risk of postoperative grade 1 morbidity (anal urgency or incontinence) compared to the HEM group (p = 0.003). At 12 POM, no statistical difference was found between the two groups of each arm in terms of grade III recurrence or reoperation. CONCLUSION Postoperative morbidity and outcome at 1 year were similar regardless of the type of devices used. These findings suggest that device type has little impact on HD treatment results.

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The immune system protects the human body against threats such as emerging cancers or infections, e.g., COVID-19. Mutated malignant cells may in many cases be controlled by the immune system to be kept at an unnoticed low amount. However, a severe infection may compromise the immune system in controlling such malignant clones leading to escape and fatal cancer progression. A novel mechanism based computational model coupling cancer and infection to the adaptive immune system is presented and analyzed. The model pin-points important physiological mechanisms responsible for cancer progression and explains numerous medical observations. The progression of a cancers and the effects of treatments depend on cancer burden, the level of infection and on the efficiency of the adaptive immune system. The model exhibits bi-stability, i.e., gravitate towards one of two stable steady states: a harmless dormant state or a full-blown cancer-infection disease state. A borderline exists and if infection exceeds this for a sufficiently long period of time the cancer escapes. Early treatment is vital for remission and may control the cancer back into the stable dormant state. CAR T-cell immunotherapy is investigated by help of the model. The therapy significantly improves its efficacy in combination with antibiotics or immunomodulation. ABSTRACT: Background: The immune system attacks threats like an emerging cancer or infections like COVID-19 but it also plays a role in dealing with autoimmune disease, e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases, and aging. Malignant cells may tend to be eradicated, to appraoch a dormant state or escape the immune system resulting in uncontrolled growth leading to cancer progression. If the immune system is busy fighting a cancer, a severe infection on top of it may compromise the immunoediting and the comorbidity may be too taxing for the immune system to control. Method: A novel mechanism based computational model coupling a cancer-infection development to the adaptive immune system is presented and analyzed. The model maps the outcome to the underlying physiological mechanisms and agree with numerous evidence based medical observations. Results and Conclusions: Progression of a cancer and the effect of treatments depend on the cancer size, the level of infection, and on the efficiency of the adaptive immune system. The model exhibits bi-stability, i.e., virtual patient trajectories gravitate towards one of two stable steady states: a dormant state or a full-blown cancer-infection disease state. An infectious threshold curve exists and if infection exceed this separatrix for sufficiently long time the cancer escapes. Thus, early treatment is vital for remission and severe infections may instigate cancer progression. CAR T-cell Immunotherapy may sufficiently control cancer progression back into a dormant state but the therapy significantly gains efficiency in combination with antibiotics or immunomodulation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dusqN5

medical,"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating on a global scale. The negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is closely related to clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Our study aimed to predict factors associated with prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data and treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Then univariate and multivariate analysis were used to screen out risk factors of influencing prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Thirty-two hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The general clinical symptoms were cough (78.1%), fever (75%), diarrhea (68.8%), expectoration (56.3%), and nausea (37.5%). More than 40% of the patients had decreased erythrocyte, hemoglobin and leucocyte and 93.8% patients were detected in abnormalities of chest CT. The median NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 19.5 days (IQR: 14.25-25). Univariate analysis found fever, nausea, diarrhea and abnormalities in chest CTs were positively associated with prolonged NCT of viral RNA (P< 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that fever [Exp (B), 0.284; 95% CI, 0.114-0.707; P<0.05] and nausea [Exp (B), 0.257; 95%CI, 0.096-0.689; P<0.05] were two significant independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: Fever and nausea were two significant independent factors in prolonged NCT of viral RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, which provided a useful references for disease progression and treatment of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1VziAU

We make use of the fact that the electron transparent specimen acts as a Fabry-Pérot interferometer for coherently emitted radiation. From the wavelength dependent interference pattern of thickness dependent measurements we calculate the refractive index of the studied material. We describe the limits of this approach and compare it with the determination of the refractive index by using valence electron energy loss spectrometry (VEELS).,Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OhTNMR

medical,"PURPOSE: Considering high risk of imported epidemic in port cities, it is necessary to estimate COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and to promote vaccination coverage of high-risk occupations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among the occupations in Yantai city, China, using an online questionnaire service platform. Targeted strategies were developed based on the survey results. In addition, periodic monitoring of the vaccination rate was provided in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. RESULTS: A total of 2231 (73.22%) of 3047 participants were willing to accept the vaccine, while 2.53% refused and 24.25% were not sure. Frontline port workers (133/152, 87.50%) and healthcare workers (999/1155, 86.49%) had higher intentions to accept, while public places and commercial service staff (584/1011, 57.76%) had the lowest. The reasons for refusal and hesitation were mainly “doubt of safety or effectiveness” (661/816, 81.00%) and “hearing previous news about vaccines” (455/816, 55.76%). Multilevel strategies such as adequate organizations, health education and promotion, and easy access to vaccination were promoted by local authorities in collaboration with schools, hospitals, enterprises and institutions. The study showed a significant increase in vaccination rate among these occupations after the implementation of these strategies (p<0.001), reaching 87.96%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among high-risk occupations was unsatisfactory before the stage of emergency vaccination. An advanced understanding of vaccine attitudes and acceptance can aid in the development of focused immunization promotion programs. It is worth emphasizing that wide strategies with the strong support and enthusiastic cooperation of the government and the industry executive can contribute to increasing occupations’ acceptance of the ongoing COVID-19 immunization project.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",7w1MRL

medical,"Abstract Two new papain inhibitors have been synthesized where the terminal α-carboxyl groups of Z-Phe-Ala-COOH and Ac-Phe-Gly-COOH have been replaced by a proton to give Z-Phe-Ala-H and Ac-Phe-Gly-H. We show that for papain, replacing the terminal carboxylate group of a peptide inhibitor with a hydrogen atom decreases binding 3–4 fold while replacing an aldehyde or glyoxal group with a hydrogen atom decreases binding by 300,000–1,000,000 fold. Thiohemiacetal formation by papain with aldehyde or glyoxal inhibitors is shown to be ~10,000 times more effective than hemiacetal or hemiketal formation with chymotrypsin. It is shown using effective molarities, that for papain, thiohemiacetal stabilization is more effective with aldehyde inhibitors than with glyoxal inhibitors. The effective molarity obtained when papain is inhibited by an aldehyde inhibitor is similar to the effective molarity obtained when chymotrypsin is inhibited by glyoxal inhibitors showing that both enzymes can stabilize tetrahedral adducts by similar amounts. Therefore the greater potency of aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors with papain is not due to greater thiohemiacetal stabilization by papain compared to the hemiketal and hemiacetal stabilization by chymotrypsin, instead it reflects the greater intrinsic reactivity of the catalytic thiol group of papain compared to the catalytic hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin. It is argued that while the hemiacetals and thiohemiacetals formed with the serine and cysteine proteases respectively can mimic the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate they are also analogues of the productive and non-productive acyl intermediates that can be formed with the cysteine and serine proteases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",R3Outq

medical,"PURPOSE. To assess and compare the serum 25OH-vitamin D levels in three cohorts of patients hospitalized due to acute illness, either related or not to a SARS-COV-2 infection. To investigate, in the patients group with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, the possible relationship between the serum vit- amin D levels and both disease severity and mortality risk. METHODS. This is a retrospective case-control study. Serum 25OH-vitamin D levels were compared between patients with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19 group, 52 patients), and two control groups, including patients with pneumonia not related to SARS-CoV-2 (NO COVID1 group, 52 patients) and patients with a non-respiratory acute disease (NO COVID2 group, 52 pa- tients). RESULTS. No differences were found in the serum 25 OH-Vitamin D levels among the three groups. In the COVID-19 group, serum 25 OH-Vitamin D levels did not show significant associa- tion with mortality risk (p=0.12), Intensive Care Unit admission risk (p=0.36), inpatients duration (p=0.40) and remission time (p=0.33). Similar results were found for parameters estimating the dis- ease severity, such as basal PO2/FiO2 (p=0.77), worse PO2/FiO2 (p=0.41), basal D-dimer (p=0.46) and basal LDH (p=0.52). CONCLUSIONS. Our data do not show lower 25OH-vitamin D levels in the patients with SARS- COV-2 pneumonia compared to patients hospitalized for other acute illnesses.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: The authors used cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to define unexplained dyspnea in patients with post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC). We assessed participants for criteria to diagnose myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of patients who recover from coronavirus disease (COVID) remain symptomatic. This syndrome is named PASC. Its etiology is unclear. Dyspnea is a frequent symptom. METHODS: The authors performed CPET and symptom assessment for ME/CFS in 41 patients with PASC 8.9 ± 3.3 months after COVID. All patients had normal pulmonary function tests, chest X-ray, and chest computed tomography scans. Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO(2)), slope of minute ventilation to CO(2) production (VE/VCO(2) slope), and end tidal pressure of CO(2) (PetCO(2)) were measured. Ventilatory patterns were reviewed with dysfunctional breathing defined as rapid erratic breathing. RESULTS: Eighteen men and 23 women (average age: 45 ± 13 years) were studied. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 59% ± 9%. Peak VO(2) averaged 20.3 ± 7 mL/kg/min (77% ± 21% predicted VO(2)). VE/VCO(2) slope was 30 ± 7. PetCO(2) at rest was 33.5 ± 4.5 mm Hg. Twenty-four patients (58.5%) had a peak VO(2) <80% predicted. All patients with peak VO(2) <80% had a circulatory limitation to exercise. Fifteen of 17 patients with normal peak VO(2) had ventilatory abnormalities including peak respiratory rate >55 (n = 3) or dysfunctional breathing (n = 12). For the whole cohort, 88% of patients (n = 36) had ventilatory abnormalities with dysfunctional breathing (n = 26), increased VE/VCO(2) (n = 17), and/or hypocapnia PetCO(2) <35 (n = 25). Nineteen patients (46%) met criteria for ME/CFS. CONCLUSIONS: Circulatory impairment, abnormal ventilatory pattern, and ME/CFS are common in patients with PASC. The dysfunctional breathing, resting hypocapnia, and ME/CFS may contribute to symptoms.

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether increasing time between admission and intubation was associated with mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who underwent mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who were admitted between January 30, 2020, and April 30, 2020, and underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to May 1, 2020. Patients were followed up through August 15, 2020. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, NY. PATIENTS: Adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A hospital-stratified time-varying Cox model was used to evaluate the effect of time from admission to intubation on in-hospital death. A total of 755 adult patients out of 5,843 admitted with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection underwent tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during the study period. The median age of patients was 65 years (interquartile range, 56–72 yr) and 64% were male. As of the time of follow-up, 121 patients (16%) who were intubated and mechanically ventilated had been discharged home, 512 (68%) had died, 113 (15%) had been discharged to a skilled nursing facility, and 9 (1%) remained in the hospital. The median time from admission to intubation was 2.3 days (interquartile range, 0.6–6.3 d). Each additional day between hospital admission and intubation was significantly associated with higher in-hospital death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, intubation earlier in the course of hospital admission may be associated with improved survival.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",FxOGlN

medical,"This report describes the development of a centrifugally controlled microfluidic dynamic solid-phase extraction (dSPE) platform to reliably obtain amplification-ready nucleic acids (NAs) directly from buccal swab cuttings. To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout. We describe an automatable, portable microfluidic platform for the nucleic acid preparation device that could permit practical, in situ use by nontechnical personnel.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",89YCSX

medical,"With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the major concerns is the burden COVID-19 will impose on the United States (U.S.) health care system. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation model representing the U.S. population and what can happen to each person who gets infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). We estimate resource use and direct medical costs per infection and at the national level, with various ""attack rates"" (infection rates) to understand the potential economic benefits of reducing the burden of the disease. A single symptomatic COVID-19 infection would cost a median of $3,045 in direct medical costs incurred only during the course of the infection. Eighty percent of the U.S. population getting infected could result in a median of 44.6 million hospitalizations, 10.7 million ICU admissions, 6.5 million ventilators used, and 249.5 million hospital bed days, costing $654.0 billion in direct costs over the course of the pandemic. If 20% were to become infected, there would be a median of 11.2 million hospitalizations, 62.3 million hospital bed days, and 1.6 million ventilators used, costing $163.4 billion.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes albopictus is an important vector for many pathogens. Understanding the virome in Ae. albopictus is critical for assessing the risk of disease transmission, implementation of vector control measures, and health system strengthening. METHODS: In this study, viral metagenomic and PCR methods were used to reveal the virome in adult Ae. albopictus captured in different areas and during different seasons in Guangzhou, China. RESULTS: The viral composition of adult Ae. albopictus varied mainly between seasons. Over 50 viral families were found, which were specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. In rural areas, Siphoviridae (6.5%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during winter and spring, while Luteoviridae (1.1%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during summer and autumn. Myoviridae (7.0% and 1.3%) was the most common viral family in mosquitoes captured in urban areas during all seasons. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was detected by PCR in a female mosquito pool. The first near full-length HBV genome from Ae. albopictus was amplified, which showed a high level of similarity with human HBV genotype B sequences. Human parechovirus (HPeV) was detected in male and female mosquito pools, and the sequences were clustered with HPeV 1 and 3 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of viral species were found in adult Ae. albopictus, including viruses from vertebrates, insects, and plants. The viral composition in Ae. albopictus mainly varied between seasons. Herein, we are the first to report the detection of HPeV and HBV in mosquitoes. This study not only provides valuable information for the control and prevention of mosquito-borne diseases, but it also demonstrates the feasibility of xenosurveillance.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety is highly prevalent and has increased in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since social anxiety negatively impacts interpersonal functioning, identifying aspects of social cognition that may be impaired can increase our understanding of the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorder. However, to date, studies examining associations between social anxiety and social cognition have resulted in mixed findings. METHODS: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the literature on the association between social anxiety and social cognition, while also considering several potential moderators and covariates that may influence findings. RESULTS: A systematic search identified 52 studies. Results showed mixed evidence for the association between social anxiety and lower-level social cognitive processes (emotion recognition and affect sharing) and a trend for a negative association with higher-level social cognitive processes (theory of mind and empathic accuracy). Most studies examining valence-specific effects found a significant negative association for positive and neutral stimuli. LIMITATIONS: Not all aspects of social cognition were included (e.g., attributional bias) and we focused on adults and not children, limiting the scope of the review. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies would benefit from the inclusion of relevant moderators and covariates, multiple well-validated measures within the same domain of social cognition, and assessments of interpersonal functioning outside of the laboratory. Additional research examining the moderating role of attention or interpretation biases on social cognitive performance, and the potential benefit of social cognitive skills training for social anxiety, could inform and improve existing cognitive behavioral interventions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9VFOQN

medical,"The phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) family comprises a group of lipolytic enzymes that typically hydrolyze the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to give rise to fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The mammalian genome encodes more than 50 PLA(2)s or related enzymes, which are classified into several subfamilies on the basis of their structures and functions. From a general viewpoint, the PLA(2) family has mainly been implicated in signal transduction, producing bioactive lipid mediators derived from fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Recent evidence indicates that PLA(2)s also contribute to phospholipid remodeling for membrane homeostasis or energy production for fatty acid β-oxidation. Accordingly, PLA(2) enzymes can be regarded as one of the key regulators of the quality of lipids, which I herein refer to as lipoquality.

medical,"Mental health is a major public health issue that affects social development. This study aims to explore the psychological state of residents of Hainan Island and its influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of psychological counseling measures to be used after the pandemic. We used the nonprobability snowball sampling method to conduct an online survey from February 21 to February 28, 2020, and collected a sample of 533 respondents. Using a binary logistic regression model and network analysis, the psychological state of residents and the main factors were analyzed during the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 (from January 20 to February 16, 2020). The study found that during the pandemic, 92.7% of the respondents were in a poor state of mind, and 54.2% experienced severe psychological stress. The mental state is spatially expressed as a pattern of “high in the middle and low in the surroundings.” Second, within the four-week sample, the overall psychological tension showed an inverted U-shaped trend. Respondents feeling stressed were most common in the second week, when they accounted for 87.99% of the total. Third, individual characteristics such as gender, age, fixed expenditure, and family size significantly affect the mental state. Women, the elderly, residents with fixed expenditures, and residents with large families are at greater risk of psychological stress. Finally, external factors such as the distance between residents and the location of cases and the node degree of the pandemic transmission network have a significant impact on the psychological state. However, residents in the least developed areas of Hainan Island, which are far away from active cases and have a low node degree, are more prone to psychological pressure. The government needs to pay special attention to these groups when constructing a long-term mechanism of psychological crisis intervention and increase public health resource investment in underdeveloped areas.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",qnK7kc

medical,"Auditory neuronal responses are modified by background noise. Inferior colliculus (IC) neuronal responses adapt to the most frequent sound level within an acoustic scene (adaptation to stimulus statistics), a mechanism that may preserve neuronal and behavioral thresholds for signal detection. However, it is still unclear if the presence of foreground stimuli and/or task involvement can modify neuronal adaptation. To investigate how task-engagement interacts with this mechanism, we compared the response of IC neurons to background noise, which caused adaptation to stimulus statistics, while macaque monkeys performed a masked tone detection task (task-driven condition) with responses recorded when the same background noise was presented alone (passive listening condition). In the task-dependent condition, monkeys performed a Go/No-Go task while 50 ms tones were embedded within an adaptation-inducing continuous background noise, whose level changed every 50 ms and were drawn from a probability distribution. The adaptation to noise stimulus statistics in IC neuronal responses was significantly enhanced in the task-driven condition compared to the passive listening condition, showing that foreground stimuli and/or task-engagement can modify IC neuronal responses. Additionally, the response of IC neurons to noise was significantly affected by the preceding sensory information (history effect) regardless of task involvement. These studies show that dynamic range adaptation in IC preserves behavioral and neurometric thresholds irrespective of noise type, and a dependence of neuronal activity on task-related factors at subcortical levels of processing.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",r61fBy

medical,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth provides health care to a patient from a provider at a distant location. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of telehealth modalities was increasing slowly but steadily. During the public health emergency, rapid widespread telehealth implementation has been encouraged to promote patient and provider safety and preserve access to health care. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was acquired from English language Internet searches of the medical and business literature and following breaking news on the COVID-19 pandemic and responses from health care stakeholders, including policymakers, payers, physicians, health care organizations, and patients. We also had extensive discussions with colleagues who are developing telehealth techniques relevant to neuro-ophthalmology. RESULTS: Regulatory, legal, reimbursement, and cultural barriers impeded the widespread adoption of telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the increased use of telehealth in response to the public health emergency, we are rapidly accumulating experience and an evidence base identifying opportunities and challenges related to the widespread adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. One of the major challenges is the current inability to adequately perform funduscopy remotely. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is an increasingly recognized means of health care delivery. Tele-Neuro-Ophthalmology adoption is necessary for the sake of our patients, the survival of our subspecialty, and the education of our trainees and students. Telehealth does not supplant but supplements and complements in-person neuro-ophthalmologic care. Innovations in digital optical fundus photography, mobile vision testing applications, artificial intelligence, and principles of channel management will facilitate further adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology and bring the specialty to the leading edge of health care delivery.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Lb-2Ln

It also investigates the degree to which knowledge management affects such a relationship in the context of Saudi Arabia. The study includes developing a survey as a data collection method. The responses from 136 SMEs were used to make an analysis and, consequently, draw a conclusion.

medical,"OBJECTIVES To explore and synthesise the evidence relating to features of quality in rural health student placements. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, Informit, Scopus, ERIC and several grey literature data sources (1 January 2005 to 13 October 2020). STUDY SELECTION The review included peer-reviewed and grey literature from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development listed countries that focused on quality of health student placements in regional, rural and remote areas. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted regarding the methodological and design characteristics of each data source, and the features suggested to contribute to student placement quality under five categories based on a work-integrated learning framework. RESULTS Of 2866 resulting papers, 101 were included for data charting and content analysis. The literature was dominated by medicine and nursing student placement research. No literature explicitly defined quality in rural health student placements, although proxy indicators for quality such as satisfaction, positive experiences, overall effectiveness and perceived value were identified. Content analysis resulted in four overarching domains pertaining to features of rural health student placement quality: (1) learning and teaching in a rural context, (2) rural student placement characteristics, (3) key relationships and (4) required infrastructure. CONCLUSION The findings suggest that quality in rural health student placements hinges on contextually specific features.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety impact up to 1 in 5 pregnant and postpartum women worldwide. Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with &#8805; 5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of &#8805; 10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04153864 .

medical,"The localization of neuronal generators during an ERP study, using a high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) equipment was made on three Evoked Related Potential (ERP) components, i.e., the Mismatch Negativity (MMN), the P300 and the N400. Furthermore, the ERP characteristics, their field distribution and the area of their maximum field intensity were extracted and compared between young and elderly, as well as between females and males. A two tone oddball experiment was conducted, involving 27 young adults and 18 elderly, healthy and right handed, and HD-EEG data were acquired. These data were then subjected to auditory ERPs extraction and thorough statistical analysis. The derived experimental results revealed significant age-related differences to both the latencies and the amplitudes of the MMN and the P300 and the topographic distribution of the HD-EEG amplitudes. Additionally, a shift in the maximum intensities from frontal to temporal lobe with aging appeared in the case of the P300, whereas no effect was observed for the MMN component. No statistical significant differences (p>0.05) due to age was found in N400 characteristics. Finally, gender-related differences were significant in the response time of the subjects, finding males response faster. The level and the location of the maximum intensity of sources also differed between genders, especially in young subjects. These findings justify the enhanced potential of HD-EEG data to accurately reflect the age and gender dependencies at the three components of simple auditory ERPs and pave the way for the investigation of neurodegenerative pathologies, such as the Alzheimer's disease.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",aAiHBr

This is underscored by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), some of which appear to be less effectively targeted by current monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies, using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures, we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering. We also identified the energetic and conservation features of epitope residues and assessed the capacity of viral variant mutations to disrupt antibody recognition, revealing sets of antibodies predicted to effectively target recently described viral variants.

medical,"Neutrophils are key players during host defense and sterile inflammation. Neutrophil dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the acquired immunodeficiency during kidney disease. We speculated that the impaired renal clearance of the intrinsic purine metabolite soluble uric acid (sUA) may account for neutrophil dysfunction. Indeed, hyperuricemia (HU, serum UA of 9-12 mg/dL) related or unrelated to kidney dysfunction significantly diminished neutrophil adhesion and extravasation in mice with crystal- and coronavirus-related sterile inflammation using intravital microscopy and an air pouch model. This impaired neutrophil recruitment was partially reversible by depleting UA with rasburicase. We validated these findings in vitro using either neutrophils or serum from patients with kidney dysfunction-related HU with or without UA depletion, which partially normalized the defective migration of neutrophils. Mechanistically, sUA impaired β2 integrin activity and internalization/recycling by regulating intracellular pH and cytoskeletal dynamics, physiological processes that are known to alter the migratory and phagocytic capability of neutrophils. This effect was fully reversible by blocking intracellular uptake of sUA via urate transporters. In contrast, sUA had no effect on neutrophil extracellular trap formation in neutrophils from healthy subjects or patients with kidney dysfunction. Our results identify an unexpected immunoregulatory role of the intrinsic purine metabolite sUA, which contrasts the well-known immunostimulatory effects of crystalline UA. Specifically targeting UA may help to overcome certain forms of immunodeficiency, for example in kidney dysfunction, but may enhance sterile forms of inflammation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZEZn-Y

medical,"Prior literature has demonstrated the power of zero pricing to boost consumer demand, but the current research shows a novel “boomerang effect”: a zero (vs. low, nonzero) price can lower demand when the offer comes with high incidental costs (e.g., the time cost in commuting to an offline class; the physical risk of getting a new vaccine). Five studies show that zero pricing, relative to low pricing, has a boosting (boomerang) effect on demand when incidental costs are low (high). The diverging effects of zero pricing on demand are explained by a dual-process model with a positive affective pathway and negative scrutiny pathway. Zero pricing triggers both positive affect and cognitive scrutiny of incidental costs; when incidental costs are high, the scrutiny pathway overrides the affective pathway and decreases demand. The finding has managerial implications as incidental costs often vary widely between marketing channels and over a product’s life cycle.

Moreover, a German study revealed a pronounced deficit of serum selenium and SELENOP concentrations in COVID-19 patients, and selenium deficiency was associated with mortality risk from COVID-19. The present study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of host selenoproteins which mediate many beneficial actions of selenium. We found that SARS-CoV-2 suppressed mRNA expression of selenoproteins associated with ferroptosis (GPX4), endoplasmic reticulum stress (SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS) and DNA synthesis (TXNRD3), while SARS-CoV-2 increased gene expression of IL-6 (an inflammatory cytokine positively correlated with severity of COVID-19), in Vero cells.

The virus and associated social restriction measures have been linked to an increase in mental health conditions. A considerable body of evidence shows that spending time in and engaging with nature can improve human health and wellbeing. Our study explores nature's role in supporting health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created web-based questionnaires with validated health instruments and conducted spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS). We collected data (n = 1184) on people's patterns of nature exposure, associated health and wellbeing responses, and potential socioecological drivers such as relative deprivation, access to greenspaces, and land-cover greenness. The majority of responses came from England, UK (n = 993). We applied a range of statistical analyses including bootstrap-resampled correlations and binomial regression models, adjusting for several potential confounding factors. We found that respondents significantly changed their patterns of visiting nature as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People spent more time in nature and visited nature more often during the pandemic. People generally visited nature for a health and wellbeing benefit and felt that nature helped them cope during the pandemic. Greater land-cover greenness within a 250 m radius around a respondent's postcode was important in predicting higher levels of mental wellbeing. There were significantly more food-growing allotments within 100 and 250 m around respondents with high mental wellbeing scores.

Regarding the first question, the best available evidence applied to the ethical principles of Beauchamp and Childress shows that treatments (such as chemotherapy) with clinical benefit are fair and beneficial. Indeed, the suspension or delay of such treatments should be considered malefic. Regarding the second question, applying the doctrine of double-effect, we show that the potential beneficial effect of vaccines in the population with cancer (or those one that has had cancer) is much higher than the potential adverse effects of these vaccines.

medical,"Pancreatic cysts: Pancreatic cysts are saclike pockets of fluid on or in your pancreas, a large organ behind the stomach that produces hormones and enzymes that help digest food. Most pancreatic cysts aren't cancerous, and many don't cause symptoms. They're typically found during imaging testing for another problem. Some are actually noncancerous (benign) pockets of fluids lined with scar or inflammatory tissue, not the type of cells found in true cysts (pseudocysts). But some pancreatic cysts can be or can become cancerous. Your doctor might take a sample of the pancreatic cyst fluid to determine if cancer cells are present. Or your doctor might recommend monitoring a cyst over time for changes that indicate cancer. You may not have symptoms from pancreatic cysts, which are often found when imaging tests of the abdomen are done for another reason. When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include: - Persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to your back   - A mass you can feel in your upper abdomen   - Nausea and vomiting When to see a doctor Rarely, cysts can become infected. See a doctor if you have a fever and persistent abdominal pain. A ruptured pseudocyst can be a medical emergency, but fortunately is rare. Fluid released by the pseudocyst can damage nearby blood vessels and cause massive bleeding. A ruptured pseudocyst can also cause infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). Seek emergency medical treatment if you have signs or symptoms of internal bleeding and shock, including: - Fainting   - Severe abdominal pain   - Decreased consciousness   - Weak and rapid heartbeat   - Vomiting of blood The cause of most pancreatic cysts is unknown. Some cysts are associated with rare illnesses including von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic disorder that can affect the pancreas and other organs. Pseudocysts often follow a bout of a painful condition in which digestive enzymes become prematurely active and irritate the pancreas (pancreatitis). Pseudocysts can also result from injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident. Heavy alcohol use and gallstones are risk factors for pancreatitis, and pancreatitis is a risk factor for pseudocysts. Abdominal injury is also a risk factor for pseudocysts. Pancreatic cysts are diagnosed more often than in the past because improved imaging technology finds them more readily. Many pancreatic cysts are found during abdominal scans for other problems. The main challenge in diagnosis is to determine whether the cyst might become cancerous. These procedures are often used to help with diagnosis and treatment planning: - Medical history. Previous abdominal injury or pancreatitis might indicate a pseudocyst. - CT scan. This imaging test can provide detailed information about the size and structure of a pancreatic cyst. - MRI scan. This imaging test can highlight subtle details of a pancreatic cyst, including whether it has any components that suggest a higher risk of cancer. - Endoscopic ultrasound. This test, like MRI, can provide a detailed image of the cyst. Also, fluid can be collected from the cyst for analysis in a laboratory for possible signs of cancer. The characteristics and location of the pancreatic cyst, with your age and sex, can help doctors pinpoint the type of cyst you have: - Serous cystadenoma can become large enough to displace nearby organs, causing abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness. Serous cystadenomas occur most frequently in women older than 60 and only rarely become cancerous. - Mucinous cystadenoma is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in middle-aged women. Mucinous cystadenoma is precancerous, which means it might become cancer if left untreated. Larger cysts might already be cancerous when found. - Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a growth in the main pancreatic duct or one of its side branches. IPMN may be precancerous or cancerous. It occurs most often in men and women older than 50. Depending on its location and other factors, IPMN may require surgical removal. - Papillary cystic tumor is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in women younger than 35. Also known as papillary cystic neoplasm, it's rare and usually cancerous. - Cystic islet cell tumor is mostly solid but can have cystlike components. Cystic islet cell tumors are rare. They can be confused with other pancreatic cysts and may be precancerous or cancerous. Watchful waiting or treatment depends on the type of cyst you have, its size, its characteristics and whether it's causing symptoms. Watchful waiting A benign pseudocyst, even a large one, can be left alone as long as it isn't bothering you. Serous cystadenoma rarely becomes cancerous, so it also can be left alone unless it causes symptoms or grows. But all pancreatic cysts should be monitored. Drainage A pseudocyst that is causing bothersome symptoms or growing larger can be drained. A small flexible tube (endoscope) is passed through your mouth to your stomach and small intestine. The endoscope is equipped with an ultrasound probe (endoscopic ultrasound) and a needle to drain the cyst. Sometimes drainage through the skin is necessary. Surgery Surgery might be needed to remove an enlarged pseudocyst or a serous cystadenoma that's causing pain or other symptoms. Other types of pancreatic cysts generally require surgical removal because of the risk of cancer. A pseudocyst may recur if you have ongoing pancreatitis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",EJDaEA

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started to spread globally since December 2019 from Wuhan, China. Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1st December 2019 and 3rd April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (&#8805;18 years) and paediatric (<18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05-81.80, I2 = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24-56.48, I2 = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59-18.32, I2 = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69-3.22, p<0.00001, I2 = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21-3.51, p<0.00001, I2 = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.44, p = 0.16, I2 = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature. Prevalence and risk of low and medium-grade fevers were higher compared to high-grade fever.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",61J4kn

medical,"Emerging viruses will continue to be a threat to human health and wellbeing into the foreseeable future. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the necessity for rapid viral sensing and inhibitor screening in mitigating viral spread and impact. Here, we present a platform that uses a label-free electronic readout as well as a dual capability of optical (fluorescence) readout to sense the ability of a virus to bind and fuse with a host cell membrane, thereby sensing viral entry. This approach introduces a hitherto unseen level of specificity by distinguishing fusion-competent viruses from fusion-incompetent viruses. The ability to discern between competent and incompetent viruses means that this device could also be used for applications beyond detection, such as screening antiviral compounds for their ability to block virus entry mechanisms. Using optical means, we first demonstrate the ability to recapitulate the entry processes of influenza virus using a biomembrane containing the viral receptor that has been functionalized on a transparent organic bioelectronic device. Next, we detect virus membrane fusion, using the same, label-free devices. Using both reconstituted and native cell membranes as materials to functionalize organic bioelectronic devices, configured as electrodes and transistors, we measure changes in membrane properties when virus fusion is triggered by a pH drop, inducing hemagglutinin to undergo a conformational change that leads to membrane fusion.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",w5dnkF

I used to have childcare support and I could often go outside to work, to run errands or for any other reason.

When she wakes up, I stay with her until around 7:00 PM. Then it is TV and dinnertime for her and work time for me again. She typically goes to bed at 8:30 PM, and I stay in her room until about 9:30 PM. At that point, I am exhausted. I can rarely work at that time. I have been in self‐isolation at home with my elderly mother, who is at high risk for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

medical,"PURPOSE: Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a widely used disinfectant and preservative which is effective against a wide range of viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), bacteria and fungi. However, it is toxic to the eye and skin. This study investigated the neutralization of BAK using ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an effort to reduce BAK toxicity potential. METHODS: BAK solutions were irradiated with a germicidal UVC lamp at various doses. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) were then exposed to the UVC-irradiated BAK solutions for 5 minutes. After exposure, the cultures were assessed for metabolic activity using PrestoBlue; for cell viability using confocal microscopy with viability dyes; and for tight junction proteins using immunofluorescence staining for zonula occludens (ZO)-1. RESULTS: UVC radiation reduced BAK toxicity on cell metabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the solution depth of BAK was 1.7 mm, the UVC doses needed to completely neutralize the toxicity of BAK 0.005% and 0.01% were 2.093 J/cm2 and 8.374 J/cm2, respectively. The cultures treated with UVC-neutralized BAK showed similar cell metabolic activity and cell viability to those treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (p = 0.806 â¼ 1.000). The expression of ZO-1 was greatly disturbed by untreated BAK; in contrast, ZO-1 proteins were well maintained after exposure to UVC-neutralized BAK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the cell toxicity of BAK can be neutralized by UVC radiation, which provides a unique way of detoxifying BAK residues. This finding may be of great value in utilizing the antimicrobial efficacy of BAK (e.g. fighting against SARS-CoV-2) while minimizing its potential hazards to human health and the environment.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pPahUR

medical,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. Development of a vaccine has been hindered by the risk of developing enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon natural exposure to the virus. Generation of higher quality neutralizing antibodies with stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigens has been proposed as a strategy to prevent ERD. We sought to test whether there was evidence of ERD in naïve BALB/c mice immunized with an unadjuvanted, stabilized pre-fusion F protein, and challenged with RSV line 19. We further sought to determine the extent to which formulation with a Th2-biased (alum) or a more Th1/Th2-balanced (Advax-SM) adjuvant influenced cellular responses and lung pathology. When exposed to RSV, mice immunized with pre-fusion F protein alone (PreF) exhibited increased airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was further exacerbated by formulation of PreF with Alum (aluminum hydroxide). Conversely, formulation of PreF with a Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvant, Advax-SM, not only suppressed RSV viral replication, but also inhibited airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was associated with lower numbers of lung innate lymphocyte cells (ILC2s) and CD4+ T cells producing IL-5+ or IL-13+ and increased IFNγ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in addition to RSV F-specific CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that in the absence of preimmunity, stabilized PreF antigens may still be associated with aberrant Th2 responses that induce lung pathology in response to RSV infection, and can be prevented by formulation with more Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvants that enhance CD4+ and CD8+ IFNγ+ T cell responses. This may support the use of stabilized PreF antigens with Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvants like, Advax-SM, as safer alternatives to alum in RSV vaccine candidates.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",H7HYLF

Method Scientific databases (Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, AgeLine, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SocArXiv, PsyArXiv) will be searched for. Google searches, snowballing, and key-informant strategies also will be used, including with a focus on the grey literature (e.g. official reports). Peer-reviewed and preprint publications will be covered in six languages, and the grey literature in English. Publications are included if they address: people with disabilities; the COVID-19 pandemic or subsequent social-economic or occupational impacts; and 3) individual or social vulnerabilities, including any form of discrimination, marginalization, or social disadvantage. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility decisions and key data extractions. Beyond mapping the literature, the results will thematically analyse any disproportionate risks people with disabilities and other form(s) of vulnerability experience in terms of: being infected by the COVID-19; having severe health consequences; and facing negative socio-economic impacts. Actions taken or recommended to reduce identified inequalities also will be synthesized. The whole research team, with diverse backgrounds, will be involved in the synthesis. Conclusion The review, planned to be expedited, aims to timely inform policy-makers, health authorities, disability advocates, and other stakeholders about needs and ways to promote equity and disability-inclusive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant socio-economic shockwaves.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",L0mxc6

medical,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, portions of the U.S. government implemented social distancing policies that, while necessary, yield unintended consequences. This article explores how risk for gender-based violence (GBV) has been exacerbated across the social-ecological model (SEM; e.g., by increasing economic stress and decreasing social support) and highlights differential impact across social locations (e.g., considering race, gender, social class). METHOD: Drawing on gender-based violence prevention and response research, considerations for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners are delineated. RESULTS: A comprehensive framework adapting an intersectional lens and the SEM is used to explain the changes in risk and protective factors for GBV. Policy recommendations that serve to augment (not replace) social distancing policies are proposed. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has uprooted life in a way that impacts GBV prevention and response. Yet, this is also an opportunity to define a new way forward rather than return to ""business as usual""; psychologists should strive to improve social services by utilizing the SEM and intersectionality.

medical,"The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has recently affected each corner of the world. Many governments of different countries have imposed strict measures in order to reduce the severity of the infection. In this present paper, we will study a mathematical model describing COVID‐19 dynamics taking into account the government action and the individuals reaction. To this end, we will suggest a system of seven fractional deferential equations (FDEs) that describe the interaction between the classical susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed (SEIR) individuals along with the government action and individual reaction involvement. Both human‐to‐human and zoonotic transmissions are considered in the model. The well‐posedness of the FDEs model is established in terms of existence, positivity, and boundedness. The basic reproduction number (BRN) is found via the new generation matrix method. Different numerical simulations were carried out by taking into account real reported data from Wuhan, China. It was shown that the governmental action and the individuals' risk awareness reduce effectively the infection spread.

medical,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive and physical difficulties are common in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA); both survivors and close family members are also at risk of developing mood disorders. In the UK, dedicated follow-up pathways for OHCA survivors and their family are lacking. A cohort of survivors and family members were surveyed regarding their experience of post-discharge care and their recommended improvements. METHOD: 123 OHCA survivors and 39 family members completed questionnaires during an educational event or later online. Questions addressed both the actual follow-up offered and the perceived requirements for optimal follow-up from the patient and family perspective, including consideration of timing, professionals involved, involvement of family members and areas they felt should be covered. RESULTS: Outpatient follow-up was commonly arranged after OHCA (77%). This was most often conducted by a cardiologist alone (80%) but survivors suggested that other professionals should also be involved (e.g. psychologist/counsellor, 64%). Topics recommended for consideration included cardiac arrest-related issues (heart disease; cause of arrest) mental fatigue/sleep disturbance, cognitive problems, emotional problems and daily activities. Most survivors advocated an early review (<1month; 61%). Most family members reported some psychological difficulties (95%); many of them (95%) advocated a dedicated follow-up appointment for family members of survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of OHCA survivors advocated an early follow-up following hospital discharge and a holistic, multidimensional assessment of arrest sequelae. These results suggest that current OHCA follow-up often fails to address patient-centred issues and to provide access to professionals deemed important by survivors and family members.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",NdYOz4

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns for population mental health and the effective provision of mental health services in the light of increased demands and barriers to service delivery [1]. Particular attention is being directed toward the possible neuropsychiatric sequelae of both COVID-19 and of the stringent societal mitigation steps deployed by national governments, concerns that are informed by historical increases in the incidence of psychotic disorders following influenza pandemics [2]. However, so far there has been scant attention paid to other important areas of psychiatry during COVID-19, including medico-legal aspects and human rights. In this paper, we discuss the legal implications for psychiatry of the COVID-19 pandemic and report a novel situation in which psychiatric patients may experience diminution of their statutory protections. We believe that this represents a paradigm shift in psychiatric care and that the consideration of the fundamental rights of psychiatric patients as ""less important"" than infection control measures compel mental health professionals to ""advocate for patients and their caregivers"" in this time of crisis [1].",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2ALwec

medical,"BACKGROUND We recently showed that vedolizumab is effective in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with prior anti-TNF failure in a multicentre compassionate early-access programme before marketing authorisation was granted to vedolizumab. AIMS To assess effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab at week 54 in patients UC and CD. METHODS Between June and December 2014, 173 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 121 with ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated with vedolizumab induction therapy. Among those 294 patients, 272 completed the induction period and were evaluated at the week 14 visit (161 patients with CD and 111 with UC). Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission at week 54. RESULTS At week 54, steroid-free clinical remission rates at week 54 were 27.2% and 40.5% in patients with CD and UC respectively. In addition, the sustained steroid-free clinical remission (from week 14 to week 54) rates were 8.1% and 19.0% respectively. No deaths were observed. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 (7.2%) patients, including six (2.5%) leading to vedolizumab discontinuation. CONCLUSION Vedolizumab is able to maintain steroid-free clinical remission in up to one-third of patients with UC and CD at week 54 with a reasonable safety profile.

medical,"As an important measure to involve services for older adults, the government procurement practices have become a key link for public health services. However, the information asymmetry between public health service purchasers and public health service undertakers triggers a supervision dilemma. Based on this background, this study uses the evolutionary game theory to analyze the symbiotic evolution between local governments and public health service institutions under different reward and punishment mechanisms, explore game evolution, strategy adjustment, and influencing factors of different game subjects, and analyze the necessity and appropriate intensity of dynamic rewards and punishment mechanisms. The results show that: under the static condition, the penalty can change the strategies of local governments to a certain extent, but it is still difficult to achieve complete self-discipline management of public health service institutions. If local governments implement a dynamic reward or penalty mechanism in the supervision process of public health services for older adults, the equilibrium between them tends to be evolutionary stable. For three dynamic mechanisms, a dynamic reward mechanism is more conducive to adopting a self-discipline behavior of public health service institutions, which is helpful to realize the supervision of public health services for older adults. Also, there is a positive correlation between the proportion of public health service institutions who adopt a “self-discipline behavior” strategy and the maximum punishment intensity, and a negative correlation with the reward intensity. This study provides theoretical and decision-making references for governments to explore the promotion and implementation of public health services in older adults.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",82F1DH
medical,"Bronchoscopy during mechanical ventilation of patients' lungs significantly affects ventilation because of partial obstruction of the tracheal tube, and may thus be omitted in the most severely ill patients. It has not previously been possible to reduce the external diameter of the bronchoscope without reducing the diameter of the suction channel, thus reducing the suctioning capacity of the device. We believed that a better-designed bronchoscope could improve the safety of bronchoscopy in patients whose lungs were ventilated. We designed a flexible bronchoscope prototype with a drumstick-shaped head consisting of a long, thin proximal portion; a short and large distal portion for camera docking; and a large suction channel throughout the length of the device. The aims of our study were to test the impact of our prototype on mechanical ventilation when inserted into the tracheal tube, and to assess suctioning capacity. We first tested the efficiency of the suction channel, and demonstrated that the suction flow of the prototype was similar to that of conventional adult bronchoscopes. We next evaluated the consequences of bronchoscopy when using the prototype on minute ventilation and intrathoracic pressures during mechanical ventilation: firstly, in vitro using a breathing simulator; and secondly, in vivo using a porcine model of pulmonary ventilation. The insertion of adult bronchoscopes into the tracheal tube immediately impaired the protective ventilation strategy employed, whereas the prototype preserved it. For the first time, we have developed an innovative flexible bronchoscope designed for bronchoscopy during invasive mechanical ventilation, that both preserved the protective ventilation strategy, and enabled efficient suction flow.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",xa-Art

medical,"Abstract Importance: Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients have a high mortality risk after COVID-19 and an altered humoral response to vaccines, but vaccine clinical efficacy remains unknown in this population. Objective: To estimate the association between vaccination and COVID-19 hospitalization rate in MHD patients Design: Using Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the expected number of SARS-CoV-2 severe infections (infections with hospital admission) in MHD patients from simultaneous cases in the general population. Setting: French population-based retrospective analysis in MHD and non-dialysis patients. Participants: Models were fitted from 3620 hospitalizations of MHD patients and 457,160 hospitalizations in the general population. Exposure: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population and vaccine exposure. Main Outcome and Measure: Weekly incidence of severe infections in MHD patients. Results: During the first epidemic wave, incidence of severe infections in MHD patients was approximately proportional to incidence in the general population. However, our model overestimated incidence during the second wave, suggesting an effect of prevention measures during the 2nd wave. A second model (based on data up to the end of the 2nd wave) estimated that the risk in MHD patients decreased between waves 1 and 2, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.76). Moreover, while this model correctly estimated the reported MHD cases up to the end of the 2nd wave, predictions overestimated the expected number of cases from the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Using vaccination coverages as additional predictors permitted to correctly fit the weekly reported number of cases, with IRR in MHD patients of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.58) for vaccine exposure in MHD patients and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.61) per 10% increase in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that both individual and herd immunity due to vaccination may yield a protective effect against severe forms of COVID-19 in MHD patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ni3eQI
medical,"Microaspiration of subglottic secretions through channels formed by folds in high volume-low pressure poly-vinyl chloride cuffs of endotracheal tubes is considered a significant pathogenic mechanism of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore a series of prevention measures target the avoidance of microaspiration. However, although some of these can minimize microaspiration, benefits in terms of VAP prevention are not always obvious. Polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tubes successfully reduce microaspiration but high quality data demonstrating VAP rate reduction are lacking. An analogous conclusion can be made regarding taper-shaped cuffs compared with classic barrel-shaped cuffs. More clinical data regarding these endotracheal tube designs are needed to demonstrate clinical value in addition to in vitro-based evidence. The clinical usefulness of endotracheal tubes developed for subglottic secretions drainage is established in multiple studies and confirmed by meta-analysis. Any change in cuff design will fail to prevent microaspiration if the cuff is insufficiently inflated. At least one well-designed trial demonstrated that continuous cuff pressure monitoring and control decrease the risk of VAP. Gel lubrication of the cuff prior to intubation temporarily hampers microaspiration through sludging the channels formed by folds in high volume-low pressure cuffs. As the beneficial effect of gel lubrication is temporarily, its potential to reduce VAP risk is probably nonsignificant. A minimum positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cmH2O can be recommended as it reduces the risk of microaspiration in vitro and in vivo. One randomized controlled study demonstrated a reduced risk of VAP in patients ventilated with PEEP (5-8 cmH2O). Regarding head-of-bed elevation, it can be recommended to avoid supine positioning. Whether a 45° head-of-bed elevation is to be preferred above 25-30° head-of-bed elevation remains unproven.

medical,"Objectives: To report a COVID-19 outbreak among workers and inpatients at a medical ward for especially vulnerable patients. Methods: Descriptive study of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10 inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in 2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10 with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean workers age was 42.1±10.9. One healthworker required Intensive Care Unit admission, and all of them recovered completely. Conclusions: In the hospital setting, close patients surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is essential, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Replacing nebulizations or high-flow oxygen therapies, when other equivalent options were available, to reduce dispersion, and controlling ventilation ducts, together with hygiene measures and an active follow-up on inpatients, visitors and workers appear to be important in preventing nosocomial outbreaks.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ROyL0x

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcomas are rare tumours with considerable heterogeneity. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to optimise patient outcomes in terms of local disease control, overall survival (OS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Time to diagnosis is variable in bone as well as soft tissue sarcoma. Possible factors for a long time from first symptom to diagnosis (the total interval) include patient, tumour and healthcare characteristics, but until now the most relevant risk factors and its association with outcomes remain unknown. Our study aims to (1) quantify total interval, the time interval from first symptom until (histological) diagnosis; (2) identify factors associated with interval length and (3) determine the association between total interval and HRQoL, stage and tumour size at diagnosis, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a longitudinal, prospective, international, multicentre cohort study among patients aged ≥18 years with newly diagnosed bone or soft tissue sarcoma at eight centres (three in UK, five in The Netherlands). Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at five points in time; one at diagnosis and at follow-up points of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Questionnaire data is collected within the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry: an international data management system for collection of patient-reported outcomes.

medical,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major challenge to health systems worldwide. Recently, numbers of epidemiological studies have illustrated that climate conditions and air pollutants are associated with the COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide. Researches also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in fecal and wastewater samples. These findings provided the possibility of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic from an environmental perspective. With this review, the main purpose is to summarize the relationship between the atmospheric and wastewater environment and COVID-19. In terms of the atmospheric environment, the evidence of the relationship between atmospheric environment (climate factors and air pollution) and COVID-19 is growing, but currently available data and results are various. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze their associations to provide constructive suggestions in responding to the pandemic. Recently, large numbers of studies have shown the widespread presence of this virus in wastewater and the feasibility of wastewater surveillance when the pandemic is ongoing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to clarify the occurrence and implication of viruses in wastewater and to understand the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology of pandemic. Overall, environmental perspective-based COVID-19 studies can provide new insight into pandemic prevention and control, and minimizes the economic cost for COVID-19 in areas with a large outbreak or a low economic level.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oYl_BN
medical,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address complex global challenges and cover aspects of social development, environmental protection, and economic growth. However, the holistic and complicated nature of the goals has made their attainment difficult. Achieving all goals by 2030 given countries’ limited budgets with the economic and social disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused is over-optimistic. To have the most profound impact on the SDGs achievement, prioritising and improving co-beneficial goals is an effective solution. This study confirms that countries’ geographic location and income level have a significant relationship with overall SDGs achievement. This article applies the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to identify the top five SDGs that drive the overall SDG score. The results show that the influential SDGs vary for countries with a specific income level located in different regions. In Europe and Central Asia, SDG10 is among the most influential goals for high-income countries, SDG9 for upper-middle-income, SDG3 in low and lower-middle-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, and SDG5 in Latin America and the Caribbean upper-middle-income countries.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported decreased trauma admissions and increased physical abuse in children resulting from stay-at-home measures. However, these studies have focused on a limited period after the implementation of lockdown policies. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of quarantine and reopening initiatives on admissions for varying types of injuries in pediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Registry data for an urban Level I pediatric trauma center were evaluated from April 1, 2018, to March 30, 2021. A timeline of local shutdown and reopening measures was established and used to partition the data into 6-month intervals. Data about demographics and injury characteristics were compared with similar intervals in 2018 and 2019 using appropriate statistical methodology for categorical, parametric, and nonparametric data. RESULTS: A total of 3,110 patients met criteria for inclusion. A total of 1,106 patients were admitted the year after the closure of schools and nonessential businesses. Decreases in overall admissions and evaluations for suspected child abuse noted early in the pandemic were not sustained during shutdown or reopening periods. However, we observed a 77% increase in all-terrain vehicle injuries, along with a 59% reduction in sports injuries (chi-square [8, N = 3,110] = 49.7; p < 0.001). Significant shifts in demographic and payor status were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to comprehensively examine the effects of quarantine and reopening policies on admission patterns for a pediatric trauma center in a metropolitan area. Total admissions and child abuse evaluations were not impacted. If shutdown measures are re-instituted, preventative efforts should be directed towards ATV use and recreational activities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vpGeVN

medical,"Employing the salutogenic approach, this longitudinal study explored the effects of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as it evolved from an acute to a chronic stress situation, during the first year. We examined the role of individual [sense of coherence (SOC)], social (perceived social support), and national [sense of national coherence (SONC)] coping resources, as well as situational and demographic factors, in predicting mental health and anxiety. Data was collected in five phases between March 2020 and February 2021 via a repeated panel sample and included 198 Jewish Israelis (52% males) age 18–64 (M = 43.5). The results confirmed the expected pattern of moving from acute to chronic stressful situation: levels of general anxiety were higher in the first phase of the pandemic outbreak as compared to the other phases. Levels of social and national coping resources significantly decreased over time. However, as expected, the salutogenic resource of the individual sense of coherence remained stable and was also found as the main predictor of both anxiety and mental health in the 5 phases of the study. Beyond the explanatory factor of SOC, mental health was better explained by the social and national coping resources, while anxiety was explained by situational factors (level of financial risk and gender). The discussion delineates the longitudinal effects of individual, social, and national coping resources on mental health and anxiety during the dynamic process of the long period of 1 year of the pandemic, evolving from acute to chronic phases of the complicated health, economic, social, and political crisis",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BVT2Wj

medical," Lung cancer - small cell Cancer - lung - small cell Small cell lung cancer SCLC Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-growing type of lung cancer. It spreads much more quickly than non-small cell lung cancer. There are two types of SCLC: Small cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer) Combined small cell carcinoma Most SCLCs are of the oat cell type. Causes About 15% of all lung cancer cases are SCLC. Small cell lung cancer is slightly more common in men than women. Almost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is very rare in people who have never smoked. SCLC is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) in the center of the chest. Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors. These tumors often spread rapidly (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone. Symptoms Symptoms of SCLC include: Bloody sputum (phlegm) Chest pain Cough Loss of appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss Wheezing Other symptoms that may occur with this disease, especially in the late stages, include: Facial swelling Fever Hoarseness or changing voice Swallowing difficulty Weakness Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked whether you smoke, and if so, how much and for how long. When listening to your chest with a stethoscope, the provider may hear fluid around the lungs or areas where the lung has partially collapsed. Each of these findings may suggest cancer. SCLC has usually spread to other parts of your body by the time it is diagnosed. Tests that may be performed include: Bone scan Chest x-ray Complete blood count (CBC) CT scan Liver function tests MRI scan Positron emission tomography (PET) scan Sputum test (to look for cancer cells) Thoracentesis (removal of fluid from the chest cavity around the lungs) In most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs or other areas to be examined under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do a biopsy: Bronchoscopy combined with biopsy CT scan-directed needle biopsy Endoscopic esophageal or bronchial ultrasound with biopsy Mediastinoscopy with biopsy Open lung biopsy Pleural biopsy Video-assisted thoracoscopy Usually, if a biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. SCLC is classified as either: Limited: cancer is only in the chest and can be treated with radiation therapy. Extensive: cancer has spread outside the area that can be covered by radiation. Treatment Because SCLC spreads quickly throughout the body, treatment will include cancer-killing drugs (chemotherapy), which are usually given through a vein (by IV). Treatment with chemotherapy and radiation may be done for people with SCLC that has spread throughout the body (most cases). In this case, the treatment only helps relieve symptoms and prolongs life, but does not cure the disease. Radiation therapy can be used with chemotherapy if surgery is not possible. Radiation therapy uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation may be used to: Treat the cancer, along with chemotherapy, if surgery is not possible. Help relieve symptoms caused by the cancer, such as breathing problems and swelling. Help relieve cancer pain when the cancer has spread to the bones. Often, SCLC may have already spread to the brain. This can occur even when there are no symptoms or other signs of cancer in the brain. As a result, some people with smaller cancers, or who had a good response in their first round of chemotherapy may receive radiation therapy to the brain. This therapy is done to prevent spread of the cancer to the brain. Surgery helps very few people with SCLC because the disease has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Surgery may be done when there is only one tumor that has not spread. If surgery is done, chemotherapy or radiation therapy is still needed. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on how much the lung cancer has spread. SCLC is very deadly. Not many people with this type of cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis. Treatment can often prolong life for 6 to 12 months, even when the cancer has spread. In rare cases, if SCLC is diagnosed early, treatment may result in a long-term cure. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you have symptoms of lung cancer, particularly if you smoke. Prevention If you smoke, now is the time to quit. If you are having trouble quitting, talk with your provider. There are many methods to help you quit, from support groups to prescription medicines. Also try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you smoke or used to smoke, talk with your provider about getting screened for lung cancer. To get screened, you need to have a CT scan of the chest.

medical,"Introduction: Improving care coordination for people with rare conditions may help to reduce burden on patients and carers and improve the care that patients receive. We recently developed a taxonomy of different ways of coordinating care for rare conditions. It is not yet known which models of care coordination are appropriate in different situations. This study aimed to: i) explore what types of care coordination may be appropriate in different situations, and ii) use these findings to develop hypothetical models of care coordination for rare conditions. Methods: To explore appropriateness of different types of care coordination, we conducted interviews (n=30), four focus groups (n=22) and two workshops (n=27) with patients, carers, healthcare professionals, commissioners, and charity representatives. Participants were asked about preferences, benefits and challenges, and the factors influencing coordination. Thematic analysis was used to develop hypothetical models of care coordination. Models were refined following feedback from workshop participants. Results: Stakeholders prefer models of care that: are nationally centralised or a hybrid of national and local care, involve professionals collaborating to deliver care, have clear roles and responsibilities outlined (including administrative, coordinator, clinical and charity roles), provide access to records and offer flexible appointments (in terms of timing and mode). Many factors influenced coordination, including those relating to the patient (e.g., condition complexity, patient's location and ability to coordinate their own care), the healthcare professional (e.g., knowledge and time), the healthcare environment (e.g., resources) and societal factors (e.g., availability of funding). We developed and refined ten illustrative hypothetical models of care coordination for rare conditions. Conclusion: Findings underline that different models of care coordination may be appropriate in different situations. It is possible to develop models of care coordination which are tailored to the individual in context. Findings may be used to facilitate planning around which models of care coordination may be appropriate in different services or circumstances. Findings may also be used by key stakeholders (e.g. patient organisations, clinicians and service planners) as a decision-making tool.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HNsoJA

medical,"A survey was conducted through a web link on the students and staff of the Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy in the period 14-30 April 2020. It was anonymous at the source and included history of COVID-19-related questions (fever, headache, cold, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal complaints and separately fever over 38.5°C) in the previous three weeks, and similar information on cohabitants. A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5°C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5°C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases.

medical,"Summary: Introduction. Due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and the national emergency state, virtual visits were implemented as an alternative to in-person visits. With this study we aimed to establish asthma patients' general satisfaction with the quality of health care provided by virtual visits (phone or video calls). Materials and methods. A questionnaire (9 questions) was published on the Facebook page of the Portuguese Association of Asthmatics. It was available online for general self-reported asthmatic patients to answer for one month, starting on 11st May 2020. The survey only allowed one answer per registered user. Results. Fifty-five responses were obtained. Patients were satisfied with communication with providers (greater than 88%); nevertheless, one-half evaluated the virtual visit as inferior when compared to in-person visits. About one third attributed a classification of 6 or less (0-10 scale, 0 being the worst and 10 the best consultation possible), but still most of the patients would either recommend it or use this kind of medical visits in the future, even outside the actual pandemic context. Patients also referred some important limitations, as lack of physical examination and the fact that the medical visit was more impersonal. Only 27% had technical issues accessing virtual visits. Positive aspects were also named, such as virtual visits being practical and avoiding the need to move to the hospital. Discussion and conclusions. Our survey revealed that small changes could further increase patients' satisfaction, adherence, and confidence in telemedicine. Although presenting some limitations, virtual visits seem to be generally well accepted by asthmatic patients and it might be a good alternative for in-person visits, at least in such difficult times when social distancing is recommended.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DI5lb3

medical,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast all around the world with more than fourteen millions of detected infected cases and more than 600.000 deaths by 20th July 2020. While scientist are working to find a vaccine, current epidemiological data shows that the most common comorbidities for patients with the worst prognosis, hypertension and diabetes, are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). BODY: Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs induce overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which has been identified as the main receptor used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter into the alveolar cells of the lungs. While cannabinoids are known to reduce hypertension, the studies testing the hypotensive effects of cannabinoids never addressed their effects on ACE-2 receptors. However, some studies have linked the endocannabinoid system (ECS) with the renin angiotensin system (RAS), including a cross-modulation between the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and angiotensin II levels. CONCLUSION: Since there are around 192 million people using cannabis worldwide, we believe that the mechanism underlying the hypotensive properties of cannabinoids should be urgently studied to understand if they can also lead to ACE-2 overexpression as other antihypertensive drugs do.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dAFWC0

medical,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between the number of prenatal care visits and the occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes in an average city in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS This was a prospective and observational study. The variables analyzed were obtained through a questionnaire administered to postpartum women (between 1 and 48 h postpartum) and information contained in prenatal cards. The pregnant women were classified into three groups: Group I, <3 prenatal care visits; Group II, 3-5 prenatal care visits; and Group III, ≥6 prenatal care visits. RESULTS Group I had a lower median weight (57.0 vs. 64.0 kg, p<0.001), body mass index (22.1 vs. 24.3 kg/m2, p<0.001), and weight gain (9.0 vs. 12 kg, p=0.002) than Group III. The prevalence of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (11.6 vs. 4.2%, p=0.02) and the newborn mortality rate within the first 72 h of life (2.3 vs. 0%, p<0.001) were higher in Group I than in Group III. Group II had a higher prevalence of admission to the adult intensive care unit (5.7 vs. 0.6%, p<0.001) and a higher newborn mortality rate within the first 72 h of life (1.6% vs. 0%, p<0.001) than Group III.

medical,"Background: The wearing of medical and non-medicaal masks by the general public in community settings is one intervention that is important for the reduction of SARS-COV-2 transmission, and has been the subject of considerable research, policy, advocacy and debate. Several observational studies have used ecological (population-level) data to assess the effect of masks on transmission, hospitalization, and mortality at the region or community level. Methods: We undertook this systematic review to summarize the study designs, outcomes, and key quality indicators of using ecological data to evaluate the association between mask wearing and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 global literature database up to 4 March 2021 for studies reporting the impact of mask use in community settings on outcomes related to SARS-COV-2 transmission using ecologic data. Findings: 21 articles were identified that analysed ecological data to assess the protective effect of policies mandating community mask wearing. All studies reported SARS-COV-2 benefits in terms of reductions in either the incidence, hospitalization, or mortality, or a combination of these outcomes. Few studies assessed compliance to mask wearing policies or controlled for the possible influence of other preventive measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, and information about compliance to these policies was lacking. Interpretation: Ecological studies have been cited as evidence to advocate for the adoption of universal masking policies. The studies summarized by this review suggest that community mask policies may reduce the population-level burden of SARS-CoV-2. Methodological limitations, in particular controlling for the actual practice of mask wearing and other preventive policies make it difficult to determine causality. There are several important limitations to consider for improving the validity of ecological data.Funding Statement: None.Declaration of Interests: None.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Yaxzq6

medical,"The corona pandemic has a huge impact on the mental wellbeing of the Dutch population. Based on a large-scale panel survey (N = 22,696) on the social impact of COVID-19, this article firstly examines which social groups are most susceptible to the mental health consequences of the pandemic. Secondly, we examine whether social capital provides protection against this impact. We find that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is considerable and that it increased over the course of 2020. Women, young people, respondents with low incomes and/or poor self-perceived health, experience relatively more fear and stress due to the pandemic. We do not find a difference between respondents with or without a migration background. Social capital (received support, trust in people and in institutions) has the expected effect: the more support and trust, the less fear and stress. There is a mediation effect. Older people, respondents with high incomes and/or good health experience less fear and stress, partly because they have more social capital. This is different for females. They would experience even more fear and stress, compared to men, were it not for the fact that they have more social capital. Hence we conclude that social capital indeed provides some protection against the negative mental health consequences of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sOKHvS

In this regard, intensive medical and biological research leading to the development of an arsenal of vaccines, albeit incomplete preconditioned evaluation, due to emergency. The subsequent scientific gap raises some concerns in the medical community and the general public. More specifically, the accelerated vaccine development downgraded the value of necessary pre-clinical studies to elicit medium- and long-term beneficial or harmful consequences. Previous experience and pathophysiological background of coronaviruses’ infections and vaccine technologies, combined with the global vaccines’ application, underlined the obligation of a cautious and qualitative approach, to illuminate potential vaccination-related adverse events. Moreover, the high SARS-CoV-2 mutation potential and the already aggregated genetical alterations provoke a rational vagueness and uncertainty concerning vaccines’ efficacy against dominant strains and the respective clinical immunity.

Thus, it is currently unknown whether liver-transplant recipients are at a higher risk of developing complications related to COVID-19. Here, we report the case of liver-transplant recipients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. A 20-year-old man who had undergone living-donor liver transplantation from his father at 5 years of age because of congenital biliary atresia was referred to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest computed tomography did not show any abnormalities; however, laboratory results revealed liver dysfunction. He received tacrolimus as maintenance therapy that was continued at the same dose. He has not developed severe pulmonary disease and was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Limited data are available on post-transplant patients with COVID-19, and this case of a young patient without metabolic comorbidities did not show any association of severe COVID-19 under tacrolimus treatment.

medical,"Background Machine learning can assist clinicians in forecasting patients with COVID-19 who develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. This analysis aimed to determine a 48 hours prediction of moderate to severe respiratory failure, as assessed with PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This was an observational study that comprised all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University Hospital of Modena, Italy from 21 February to 6 April 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed with PCR positive nasopharyngeal swabs while the presence of pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. Patients received standard of care according to national guidelines for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients' full medical history, demographic and epidemiological features, clinical data, complete blood count, coagulation, inflammatory and biochemical markers were routinely collected and aggregated in a clinically-oriented logical framework in order to build different datasets. The dataset was used to train a learning framework relying on Microsoft LightGBM and leveraging a hybrid approach, where clinical expertise is applied alongside a data-driven analysis. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify the positive or negative impact of each variable included in the model on the predicted outcome. The study outcome was the onset of moderate to severe respiratory failure defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150 mmHg ([≥] 13.3 kPa) in at least one of two consecutive arterial blood gas analyses in the following 48 hours. Results A total of 198 patients contributed to generate 1068 valuable observations which allowed to build 3 prediction models based respectively on 31-variables signs and symptoms, 39-variables laboratory biomarkers and 91-variables as a composition of the two. A fourth boosted mixed model which included 20 variables was selected from the model 3, achieved the best predictive performance (AUC=0.84). Its clinical performance was applied in a narrative case report as an example. Conclusion This study developed a machine learning algorithm, with a 84% prediction accuracy, which is potentially able to assist clinicians in decision making process with therapeutic implications.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",JVCg3W

medical,"Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed in seven tigers with the use of a vessel-sealing device and a three-port technique. A comparison group of seven tigers that underwent traditional ovariohysterectomy was assembled with the use of a medical records search. Mean operative times for laparoscopic ovariectomy were compared to standard ovariohysterectomy, and mean combined laparoscopic incision length compared to standard ovariohysterectomy incision lengths. Significance was set at P < or = 0.05. Mean surgical time for laparoscopic ovariectomy (82 min, range 71-126 min) was significantly shorter than standard ovariohysterectomy surgical time (129 min, range 80-165 min, P = 0.007). Mean combined laparoscopic incision length (8.07 cm, range 3.80-9.50 cm) was significantly shorter than the mean incision length for standard ovariohysterectomy (13.57 cm, range 12.00-20.00 cm, P = 0.009). There were no clinically important complications observed in either group. Laparoscopic ovariectomy has a significantly shorter surgical time and combined incision length compared to standard ovariohysterectomy in tigers, and appears to be a safe and rapid sterilization method for tigers. Equipment cost and the necessity for advanced training may limit its use in some institutions.

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are highly threatened in the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, but evidence of risk factors for mortality in this population is still lacking. METHODS: We followed outcomes of the overall MHD population of Wuhan, including 7154 MHD patients from 65 hemodialysis centers, from January 1 to May 4, 2020. Among them, 130 were diagnosed with COVID‐19. The demographic and clinical data of them were collected and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: Compared to the corresponding period of last year, the all‐cause mortality rate of the Wuhan MHD population significantly rose in February, and dropped down in March 2020. Of the 130 COVID‐19 cases, 51 (39.2%) were deceased. Advanced age, decreased oxygen saturation, low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on admission, and complications including acute cardiac injury (HR 5.03 [95% CI 2.21–11.14], p < 0.001), cerebrovascular event (HR 2.80 [95% CI 1.14–6.86], p = 0.025) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 3.50 [95% CI 1.63–7.51], p = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for the death of COVID‐19. The median virus shedding period of survivors was 25 days, longer than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance hemodialysis patients are a highly vulnerable population at increased risk of mortality and prolonged virus shedding period in the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic. Advanced age, decreased oxygen saturation, low DBP on admission, and complications like acute cardiac injury are parameters independently associated with poor prognosis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",bKpJV0

After 7 days I still had bad chest pains and no productive cough. I called him and he ordered a chest X-ray . The X-ray came back clear so he ruled out pneumonia . The chest pains worsened so much that it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest and I became very hot and sweaty, difficult to breathe etc... I am a single mom so I was trying not to scare my 9 year old daughter. My brother and mother came over and while my mom watched my daughter my brother took me to the ER.

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the consumption habits of tourists to benefit sustainable destinations that are not overcrowded, such as rural tourism destinations. However, the periods of compulsory lockdown have had devastating effects on tourism businesses operating in rural areas and have even jeopardised their economic viability. The aim of this article is to quantify in relative terms the effects that the period of compulsory lockdown in a markedly tourist country, such as Spain, between March and May 2020 has had on rural accommodation in one of the most rural provinces of Spain (Cáceres). Based on a random sample of 225 rural accommodation establishments and the consideration of various factors, statistical techniques of comparison of means and proportions were used to detect differences in the intensity of the effects of the compulsory lockdown on the economic-financial management, bookings, facilities, and input of rural accommodation establishments in the province. The results obtained show that the economic, labour, and management effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural tourism businesses in the province of Cáceres have been very substantial. In particular, the businesses with the highest level of tourist services on supply, i.e., those that, in addition to accommodation, also offer other tourist activities, have been the most affected. In view of this situation, urgent emergency measures have been put in place at a provincial level to alleviate the economic loss and the destruction of jobs caused by this pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1cfH7H
medical,"Abstract With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), predictive maintenance (PdM) for smart manufacturing receives attentions recently. For the monitoring of machines with rotary components, sound and vibration emitted from the machines have been utilized as the meaningful information. However, sound sensors are susceptible to external noise and the costs for signal conditioning should be considered. In this paper, a stethoscope is utilized as an internal sound sensor which are capable of noise reduction and affordable as IoT solutions. After the stethoscope was assembled with a microphone, a frequency range for measurement was identified as 0~255Hz using the swept-sine technique. Two stethoscope sensors were attached to an industrial robot, and the capability of noise reduction is verified by similarity of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms from sounds with and without existence of factory noise. Next, impact tests were performed to detect collision when the robot was stationary, and collisions by human hand during robot operation were detected from STFT spectrogram analysis. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from the spectrograms was established to estimate a rotating joint axis during operation, showing 91% and 90.83% accuracy for each stethoscope, respectively.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pgm7Kh

This review presents the first comprehensive, up-to-date information and research progression on the nutritional value, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and toxicity of the genus Merremia. Using the key search term “Merremia”, relevant documents and information were retrieved from electronic databases. Relevant documents were uploaded in RStudio with installed bibliometric software packages and used for data retrieval, tabulation, and network visualization. Bibliometric analysis revealed that ca. 55% of the studies related to Merremia were published in the last decade, which can be grouped into four thematic areas: (i) drug formulation, (ii) taxonomy, (iii) chemical analysis, and (iv) treatment of diseases. Ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and biological activities studies showed that species in the genus are promising medicinal plants with various pharmaceutical potentials. However, clinical studies to validate the efficacy of the reported bioactivities and the mechanisms underlying the various activities are lacking and should constitute a future research focus.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to attempt remote consultation, but there are limited data on the use of telepsychiatry in general, and almost none about the experience of telepsychiatry in a consultation-liaison context. OBJECTIVE: We looked for attributes that correlated with satisfactory tele-encounters. METHODS: Eleven consultation-liaison attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March to June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: A vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty in using the platform was less common for female patients (odds ratio = 0.239, P = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 9.059, P < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 0.189, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it. However, abrupt transition to the use of telepsychiatry to limit contagion risk was mostly satisfactory in our center; identifying for which patient encounters it is most and least appropriate will help guide future use.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8Or6kb

This situation had the potential to lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which could result in an increase in severe cases and deaths. This analysis was based on findings from a field visit, carried out between June 30th and July 1st, 2020, to a warehouse, to two health facilities, and a meeting with a community health worker, and an descriptive epidemiologic data analysis of health information system (HIS) to evaluate trends of the number of people tested for malaria and number of malaria cases reported, by comparing data from 2018, 2019 and 2020 for the period between January and May. The two health facilities and the warehouse had about two months of stock of antimalarial drugs, and patients with malaria symptoms were being tested for malaria at the COVID-19 screening site. The HIS data showed that the number of reported malaria cases decreased by 3.0% (177.646/172.246) in April, and 7.0% (173.188/161.812) in May, when comparing 2019 and 2020 data. People tested for malaria in community increased by 39.0% (190.370/264.730), between 2019 and 2020.

medical,"Résumé Introduction: La Société Française de Chirurgie Rachidienne (SFCR) a des recommandations pendant la pandémie COVID. L’objectif de ce travail est de rapporter l’organisation et l’activité en chirurgie rachidienne pendant le premier mois de confinement de 6 centres en France. L’objectif secondaire est de contrôler l’adéquation de nos pratiques avec les recommandations de la SFCR. Matériel et méthode: Il s’agit d’une étude observationnelle multicentrique prospective entre le 16 Mars et le 16 Avril 2020 rapportant l’activité chirurgicale rachidienne dans chaque institution, ainsi que les modifications organisationnelles appliquées. L’activité chirurgicale était comparée à celle de la même période en 2019 dans chaque centre et évaluée en fonction des recommandations de la SCFR afin de contrôler l’adéquation de nos pratiques en période de pandémie. Résultats: Pendant le pic de l’épidémie 246 patients dont 6 patients COVID+ ont été pris en charge chirurgicalement. Les baisses d’activité les plus importantes étaient retrouvées à Strasbourg (-81,5%) et à Paris (-65%), régions dans lesquelles la situation sanitaire était la plus critique, mais également à Bordeaux (-75%) malgré une circulation virale moins importante. Un fonctionnement de 20 à 50% des capacités normales des salles opératoires était noté. La diminution importante des procédures pour rachis dégénératif ou déformations était en adéquation avec les recommandations de la SFCR. Conclusion: Le maintien d’une activité chirurgicale rachidienne est possible et souhaitable même en période de crise sanitaire. Les indications doivent être réfléchies selon les critères d’urgences élaborés par les sociétés savantes et adaptées à l’évolution sanitaire et aux possibilités techniques de prise en charge par centre.

medical,"1) In seasonal environments, fluctuating early-season weather conditions and short breeding windows limit reproductive opportunities, such that breeding earlier or later than the optimum may be particularly costly. Given the risk of early-season energy limitations, time- and energy-based carry-over effects stemming from environmental conditions across the annual cycle may have pronounced consequences for breeding phenology and fitness. Generally, when and where environmental conditions are most influential are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict the future of climate sensitive populations. 2) For an alpine-breeding, migratory population of horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) in northern British Columbia, Canada (54.8°N), we assessed how weather conditions across the annual cycle influenced clutch initiation date and offspring development. We also addressed how cross-seasonal effects on breeding parameters combine to influence reproductive fitness. 3) With 12 years of breeding data and 3 years of migration data, we used a sliding window approach to identify points during the annual cycle when weather events most influenced breeding phenology and offspring development. Consequences for breeding success were assessed using nest survival simulations. 4) Average clutch initiation date varied up to 11 days among years but did not advance from 2003 to 2019. Warmer temperatures at stopover and breeding sites advanced clutch initiation, but winter conditions had no effect. Sub-zero stopover temperatures carried over to prolong offspring development independent of clutch initiation date, potentially indicating energy-based carry-over effects acting on parental investment. Nest survival decreased with both later clutch initiation and prolonged offspring development, such that females nesting earlier and fledging offspring at a younger age were up to 45% more likely to reproduce successfully. 5) We demonstrate that stronger carry-over effects originated from environmental conditions closer to the breeding site in time and space, as well as the potential for energy-based mechanisms to link pre-breeding conditions to reproductive fitness. We also highlight the importance of extended stopovers for songbirds breeding in seasonal environments, particularly given that climatic conditions are becoming increasingly decoupled across stages of the annual cycle. Understanding the cross-seasonal mechanisms shaping breeding decisions in stochastic environments allows for more accurate predictions of population-level responses to climate change.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vOE4nA

medical,"We aimed to assess the effectiveness of remifentanil used as intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for the pain of labour. We performed a systematic literature search in December 2015 (updated in December 2016). We included randomised, controlled and cluster-randomised trials of women in labour with planned vaginal delivery receiving patient-controlled remifentanil compared principally with other parenteral and patient-controlled opioids, epidural analgesia and continuous remifentanil infusion or placebo. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction with pain relief and the occurrence of adverse events for mothers and newborns. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and applied the GRADE approach for the quality of evidence. We included total zero event trials, using a constant continuity correction of 0.01 and a random-effect meta-analysis. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative analysis; within these, 3713 participants were randomised and 3569 analysed. Most of our pre-specified outcomes were not studied in the included trials. However, we found evidence that women using patient-controlled remifentanil were more satisfied with pain relief than women receiving parenteral opioids (four trials, 216 patients, very low quality evidence) with a standardised mean difference ([SMD] 95%CI) of 2.11 (0.72-3.49), but were less satisfied than women receiving epidural analgesia (seven trials, 2135 patients, very low quality evidence), -0.22 (-0.40 to -0.04). Data on adverse events were sparse. However, the relative risk (95%CI) for maternal respiratory depression for patient-controlled remifentanil compared with epidural analgesia (three trials, 687 patients, low-quality evidence) was 0.91 (0.51-1.62). Compared with continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil (two trials, 135 patients, low-quality evidence) no conclusion could be reached as all study arms showed zero events. The relative risk (95%CI) of Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 min after birth compared with epidural analgesia (five trials, 1322 participants, low-quality evidence) was 1.26 (0.62-2.57).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RDPLPI
medical,"Intraoperative frozen section analysis can be used to improve the accuracy of tumour margin estimation during cancer resection surgery through rapid processing and pathological assessment of excised tissue. Its applicability is limited in some cases due to the additional risks associated with prolonged surgery, largely from the time-consuming staining procedure. Our work uses a measurable property of bulk tissue to bypass the staining process: as tumour cells proliferate, they influence the surrounding extra-cellular matrix, and the resulting change in elastic modulus provides a signature of the underlying pathology. In this work we accurately localise atomic force microscopy measurements of human liver tissue samples and train a generative adversarial network to infer elastic modulus from low-resolution images of unstained tissue sections. Pathology is predicted through unsupervised clustering of parameters characterizing the distributions of inferred values, achieving 89% accuracy for all samples based on the nominal assessment (n = 28), and 95% for samples that have been validated by two independent pathologists through post hoc staining (n = 20). Our results demonstrate that this technique could increase the feasibility of intraoperative frozen section analysis for use during resection surgery and improve patient outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",8DEPrb

medical,"The gut microbiota has been shown to play diverse roles in human health and disease although the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Large cohort studies can provide further understanding into inter-individual differences, with more precise characterization of the pathways by which the gut microbiota influences human physiology and disease processes. Here, we aimed to profile the stool microbiome of children and adults from two population-based cohort studies, comprising 2,111 children in the age-range of 9 to 12 years (the Generation R Study) and 1,427 adult individuals in the range of 46 to 88 years of age (the Rotterdam Study). For the two cohorts, 16S rRNA gene profile datasets derived from the Dutch population were generated. The comparison of the two cohorts showed that children had significantly lower gut microbiome diversity. Furthermore, we observed higher relative abundances of genus Bacteroides in children and higher relative abundances of genus Blautia in adults. Predicted functional metagenome analysis showed an overrepresentation of the glycan degradation pathways, riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis pathways in children. In contrast, the gut microbiome of adults showed higher abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, beta-lactam resistance, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pantothenic (vitamin B5) biosynthesis pathways. A predominance of catabolic pathways in children (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation) as compared to biosynthetic pathways in adults (valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis) suggests a functional microbiome switch to the latter in adult individuals. Overall, we identified compositional and functional differences in gut microbiome between children and adults in a population-based setting. These microbiome profiles can serve as reference for future studies on specific human disease susceptibility in childhood, adulthood and specific diseased populations.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WCK-NX

Eleven Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs) support family caregivers across the state of California, providing services such as assessment, counseling and respite. This presentation is part of a larger evaluation study and addresses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family caregivers and systems supporting them. We interviewed directors, clinical staff and family consultants (n=35) from CRCs across diverse communities and geography in California, conducting semi-structured focus group interviews by Zoom. Questions explored perceptions of staff about effects on caregivers and implications for systems of support for caregivers. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using the Dedoose software. Caregiver effects included increased isolation, higher stress, loss of support, neglected health needs, and accelerated technology adoption. Caregivers at particular risk were those facing multiple demands and experiencing compromised resources under the pandemic, such as closure of adult day care. System effects included challenges with hastened virtual delivery, disruption in services, and new opportunities to serve clients virtually. Community resources, such as internet connectivity, exacerbated disparities for family caregivers. We make recommendations to mitigate these challenges including technology platforms to support service delivery and education, training and preparedness for both caregivers and providers.

medical," Bulimia nervosa Overview Bulimia nervosa, often called bulimia, is a type of eating disorder. People with bulimia eat large amounts of food at one time, then try to get rid of the food or weight gain by throwing up, taking laxatives, fasting (not eating anything), or exercising a lot more than normal. Bulimia affects more girls and women than boys and men. Bulimia is a serious health problem, but people with bulimia can get better with treatment. What is bulimia? Bulimia nervosa, often called bulimia, is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. Women with bulimia eat a lot of food in a short amount of time and feel a lack of control over eating during this time (called binging). People with bulimia then try to prevent weight gain by getting rid of the food (called purging). Purging may be done by: Women with bulimia may also try to prevent weight gain after binging by exercising a lot more than normal, eating very little or not at all (fasting), or taking pills to urinate often. Women with bulimia usually have self-esteem that is closely linked to their body image. What is the difference between bulimia and other eating disorders? Women with eating disorders, such as bulimia, anorexia, and binge eating disorder, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike women with anorexia, women with bulimia often have a normal weight. Unlike women with binge eating disorder, women with bulimia purge, or try to get rid of the food or weight after binging. Binging and purging are usually done in private. This can make it difficult to tell if a loved one has bulimia or another eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Who is at risk for bulimia? Bulimia affects more women than men. It affects up to 2% of women1 and happens to women of all races and ethnicities.2 Bulimia affects more girls and younger women than older women. On average, women develop bulimia at 18 or 19.3 Teen girls between 15 and 19 and young women in their early 20s are most at risk. But eating disorders are happening more often in older women. In one recent study, 13% of American women over 50 had signs of an eating disorder.4 What are the symptoms of bulimia? Someone with bulimia may be thin, overweight, or have a normal weight. It can be difficult to tell based on a person's weight whether someone has bulimia. This is because binging and purging is most often done in private. However, family or friends may see empty food wrappers in unexpected places or vomit in the home. Over time, some symptoms of bulimia may include:5 Girls or women with bulimia may also have behavior changes such as: People with bulimia often have other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.6 What causes bulimia? Researchers are not sure exactly what causes bulimia and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Researchers are also studying unusual activity in the brain, such as changing levels of serotonin or other chemicals, to see how it may affect eating. Learn more about current research on bulimia. How does bulimia affect a woman's health? Purging through vomiting or taking laxatives can prevent your body from getting the important nutrients it needs from food. Over time, bulimia can affect your body in the following ways:5,7,8 Long-term studies of 20 years or more show that women who had an eating disorder in the past usually reach and maintain a healthy weight after treatment.9 How is bulimia diagnosed? Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating, purging, or exercise behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you get better. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may do blood or urine tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. Your doctor may also do other tests to see whether you have any other health problems caused by bulimia. These tests may include kidney function tests or an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to see if or how repeated binging and purging has affected your health. How is bulimia treated? Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following:6 Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat and exercise in healthy ways again.12 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. How does bulimia affect pregnancy? Bulimia can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Repeated purging and binging can make your menstrual cycle irregular (your period comes some months but not others) or your period may stop for several months. Irregular or missing periods mean you may not ovulate, or release an egg from the ovary, every month. This can make it difficult to get pregnant.13 However, if you do not want to have children right now and you have sex, you should use birth control. Bulimia can also cause problems during pregnancy. Bulimia raises your risk for: If I had an eating disorder in the past, can I still get pregnant? Women who have recovered from bulimia and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. If you had an eating disorder in the past, it may take you a little longer to get pregnant (about six months to a year) compared to women who never had an eating disorder.17 Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. If I take medicine to treat bulimia, can I breastfeed my baby? Maybe. Some medicines used to treat bulimia can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding section. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and any about possible side effects for your nursing baby.

medical,"Thermal stability of polypropylene (PP) over a broad temperature is critical for many applications. Hindered phenol (HP) groups have been utilized in PP for thermal-oxidative protection. This paper studies thermal stability of the electret property of PP linked with 0.2 mol% HP. It is observed that small amount of chemically linked HP groups improves electret thermal stability as reflected by the higher peak temperature of the thermally stimulated discharge curve and about 65% increase in the trap level. In addition, the HP groups in PP generate “rigid backbones” which maintain the PP film shapes to temperatures near the melting (~ 150 °C), compared with pristine PP at 70 °C.

medical,"Obesity (Alternative medicine): Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often questionable. Herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals, all considered dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration, don't have the same rigorous testing and labeling process as over-the-counter and prescription medications do. Yet some of these substances, including products labeled as ""natural,"" have drug-like effects that can be dangerous. Even some vitamins and minerals can cause problems when taken in excessive amounts. Ingredients may not be standard, and they can cause unpredictable and harmful side effects. Dietary supplements also can cause dangerous interactions with prescription medications you take. Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements.

In this introductory article, we first provide a brief overview of the growing scholarship on the impact of the pandemic on both national welfare systems and EU policies. We then contextualise the initial pandemic policy responses by highlighting the economic challenges to European welfare states leftover from the Great Recession and Eurozone crisis before outlining the timeline of the EU reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, culminating in the Next Generation EU deal. Finally, we summarize the distinctive empirical and theoretical perspectives of each contribution to this Special Issue. Taken together, the articles in this issue offer a much-needed analysis of the interplay between EU level and member state politics that furthers our understanding of the social and economic policies implemented in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Zwy8tO

medical,"COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2020. In light of the global shortage of PPE and concerns regarding the safety of healthcare providers, clinicians have resorted to the use of novel protective barriers, such as aerosol boxes and plastic sheets, during aerosol generating procedures, especially tracheal intubation. We compared the effect of these barriers on the tracheal intubation of simulated patients with severe COVID-19 in a crossover study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of King Faisal Specialist Hospital, and the procedures were compliant with the COVID-19 airway management guidelines of the Saudi Anesthesia Society. The time to intubation was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included number of optimization maneuvers, number of intubation attempts, time to glottic view and ventilation of the lungs, and damage to PPE. Thirteen consultant anesthetists performed 39 tracheal intubations on a manikin using each of three approaches (aerosol box, plastic sheet, and no-barrier). Data were collected via direct and video observation. The plastic sheet approach demonstrated the highest time to intubation (mean ± StE [95% CI]: 33.3s ± 3.5 [25.8– 40.9]) compared to the aerosol box (22.0s ± 2.5 [16.5 – 27.5], P < 0.01) and no-barrier approaches (16.1s ± 1.1 [13.7 – 18.4], P < 0.0001). Similarly, the plastic sheet approach had the highest time to glottic view, and ventilation intervals compared to the other two approaches, while the no-barrier approach had the shortest time intervals. There were no failed intubations or damage to the PPE sustained during the use of any of the three approaches. The aerosol box does not impose a significant delay in tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopy, unlike the plastic sheet barrier. Further research on the aerosolization risk is warranted before these protective barriers can be considered as mainstay approaches during aerosol generating procedures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",GVWu8u
medical,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated the crucial effect of the public's compliance with the government's health instructions on the population's health. However, evidence shows that some communities are less likely to comply with such instructions than others. This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them. Policy-makers and health authorities should consider providing information about the risks and negative outcomes of the crisis as well as the expected effectiveness of the recommended behaviors. Future research should examine other minority groups and other types of instructions in different stages of a crisis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5IVZQ_

I didn t take any medication for the depression. A few months back I was prescribed Inderal for anxiety and breathlessness especially related to work. I noticed that my usual blood pressure (65-75) dropped further to around 60-65 after Inderal. I took the drastic decision of quitting my job and Inderal.

medical,"Abstract Digital twin (DT) is one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0 as it is a critical component in driving real-time simulation and decision making in complex systems. The existing scientific literature on Digital twin primarily refers to a product entity or a physical machine but the core concept can be applied to the entire product lifecycle, particularly the assembly process of a complex product system. In addition, majority of existing work focus on the Digital Twins of individual machines on a shop-floor. This paper focuses on aspects the process to build DTs of a production schedule for a complex defence weapon system. The process is inherently high variety and low quantity in a very manual assembly process. This paper consists of three elements. (1) It reviews the current state of art along with the research gap and discusses how DT can become a tool to the manual assembly process. (2) A data-driven simulation algorithm is proposed to model the complex and manual manufacturing process in a generic-reusable way. (3) Finally, an appropriate complex industrial case study is studied to exemplify the proposed framework. Results demonstrate that the production managers can make more informed early decisions that can help bring assembly schedules in check and limit wasteful efforts when disruptions in the supply chain of parts sourced for the assembly occur.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",vBfffG

medical,"We present the kinematic and chemical profiles of red giant stars observed by the APOGEE-2 survey in the direction of the Jhelum stellar stream, a Milky Way substructure located in the inner halo of the Milky Way at a distance from the Sun of $\approx$ 13 kpc. From the six APOGEE-2 Jhelum pointings, we isolate stars with log($g$) $<$ 3.5, leaving a sample of 289 red giant stars. From this sample of APOGEE giants, we identified seven stars that are consistent with the astrometric signal from $Gaia$ DR2 for this stream. Of these seven, one falls onto the RGB along the same sequence as the Jhelum stars presented by \cite{ji20}. This new Jhelum member has [Fe/H]=-2.2 and is at the tip of the red giant branch. By selecting high orbital eccentricity, metal-rich stars, we identify red giants in our APOGEE sample that are likely associated with the $Gaia$-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger. We compare the abundance profiles of the Jhelum stars and GES stars and find similar trends in $\alpha$-elements, as expected for low-metallicity populations. However, we find that the orbits for GES and Jhelum stars are not generally consistent with a shared origin. The chemical abundances for the APOGEE Jhelum star and other confirmed members of the stream are similar to stars in known stellar streams and thus are consistent with an accreted dwarf galaxy origin for the progenitor of the stream, although we cannot rule out a globular cluster origin.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",VVISwk

METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of SMA1 patients and their outcomes according to the following choices: letting nature take its course (NT); tracheostomy and invasive mechanical ventilation (TV); continuous noninvasive respiratory muscle aid (NRA), including noninvasive ventilation; and mechanically assisted cough. RESULTS Of 194 consecutively referred patients enrolled in this study (103 males, 91 females), NT, TV, and NRA were chosen for 121 (62.3%), 42 (21.7%), and 31 (16%) patients, respectively. Survival at ages 24 and 48 months was higher in TV than NRA users: 95% (95% confidence interval: 81.8%-98.8%) and 67.7% (95% confidence interval: 46.7%-82%) at age 24 months (P < .001) and 89.43% and 45% at age 48 months in the TV and NRA groups, respectively (P < .001). The choice of TV decreased from 50% (1992-1998) to 12.7% (2005-2010) (P < .005) with a nonstatistically significant increase for NT from 50% to 65%. The choice of NRA increased from 8.1% (1999-2004) to 22.7% (2005-2010) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Long-term survival outcome is determined by the choice of the treatment.

medical,"The main goal of this online survey was to investigate the attitudes of Brazilians towards “cell-based meat”, which has become the subject of great scientific and media enthusiasm. The answers of 4471 respondents concluded that 46.6% of them thought “cell-based meat” was promising and acceptable. More than 66% would be willing to try this novel product compared to 23% who expressed reluctance to do so. Nearly 40% of the total respondents did not want to eat “cell-based meat” regularly at all, whereas 29%, 43.2%, and 39.9% were willing to eat it regularly in restaurants, at home, and/or in ready-made meals, respectively. However, the majority of respondents (71%) were keen to pay much less for “cell-based meat” than conventionally produced meat (or even nothing at all), compared to 24.3% who were willing to pay the same price as conventional meat, whereas only 4.8% were willing to pay more. Approximately 51% of them considered that “cell-based meat” should not be called “meat” for marketing purposes. Job, monthly income, age, and gender were major factors impacting consumer acceptance. Meat professionals and consumers with higher incomes were less willing to eat “cell-based meat” regularly. Women (especially younger women) were the most concerned about the ethical and environmental issues related to meat production and were the most convinced that reducing meat consumption could be a good solution to the meat industry’s problems. Respondents who did not accept “cell-based meat” and did not eat meat substitutes had a negative attitude to this novel food (they considered it absurd and/or disgusting) and did not believe that “cell-based meat” should be called “meat” for marketing purposes. In contrast, the people who thought that “cell-based meat” could be called “meat” perceived it in a rather positive way. These results are important for consumers of meat and meat substitutes and for companies aiming to enter the potential future Brazilian market of “cell-based meat”.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",66VNZg

medical," Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare IBS Mucus colitis IBS-D IBS-C Summary Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. Your health care provider will talk about things you can do at home to manage your condition. What to Expect at Home Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be a lifelong condition. You may be suffering from cramping and loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, or some combination of these symptoms. For some people, IBS symptoms may interfere with work, travel, and attending social events. But taking medicines and making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. Diet Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone. Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating. This will help you look for a pattern of foods that may make your symptoms worse. Avoid foods that cause symptoms. These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley. Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones. Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly. Medicines No one drug will work for everyone. Medicines your provider may have you try include: Antispasmodic medicines that you take before eating to control colon muscle spasms and abdominal cramping Antidiarrheal medicines such as loperamide Laxatives, such as lubiprostone, bisacodyl , and other ones bought without a prescription Antidepressants to help relieve pain or discomfort Rifaximin, an antibiotic that is not absorbed from your intestines It is very important to follow your provider's instructions when using medicines for IBS. Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems. Stress Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including: Not being able to do activities because of your pain Changes or problems at work or at home A busy schedule Spending too much time alone Having other medical problems A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed. Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry. Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations. Reach out to other people. Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress.

medical,"The global measles vaccination program has been extraordinarily successful in reducing measles-related disease and deaths worldwide. Eradication of measles is feasible because of several key attributes, including humans as the only reservoir for the virus, broad access to diagnostic tools that can rapidly detect measles-infectious persons, and availability of highly safe and effective measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). All 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions have established measles elimination goals. Globally, during 2000–2018, measles incidence decreased by 66% (from 145 to 49 cases per million population) and deaths decreased by 73% (from 535 600 to 142 300), drastically reducing global disease burden. Routine immunization with MCV has been the cornerstone for the control and prevention of measles. Two doses of MCV are 97% effective in preventing measles, qualifying MCV as one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. Mild adverse events occur in <20% of recipients and serious adverse events are extremely rare. The economic benefits of measles vaccination are highlighted by an overall return on investment of 58 times the cost of the vaccine, supply chains, and vaccination. Because measles is one of the most contagious human diseases, maintenance of high (≥95%) 2-dose MCV coverage is crucial for controlling the spread of measles and successfully reaching measles elimination; however, the plateauing of global MCV coverage for nearly a decade and the global measles resurgence during 2018–2019 demonstrate that much work remains. Global commitments to increase community access to and demand for immunizations, strengthen national and regional partnerships for building public health infrastructure, and implement innovations that can overcome access barriers and enhance vaccine confidence, are essential to achieve a world free of measles.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gqqemE

However, their successful use in China, South Korea and the Czech Republic has encouraged their widespread use, and the shortage that already existed. This has caused that companies and individuals are looking at the best way to reuse them, and to manufacture, homemade or not, of non-certified masks. This paper is based on two objectives: to consult the scientific literature to identify the main strategies for disinfecting them, and to determine the effectiveness of non-certified disposable masks. A rapid review has been conducted in which the main publications and other information available online have been analyzed. Results showed that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam are not fully recommended. Regarding the effectiveness of surgical masks compared to PPE, the former have been seen to be slightly less effective than PPE. As for other types of masks the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified masks is very low.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",czeW0O
medical,"It is well known that the new coronavirus pandemic has global environmental, public health, and economic implications. In this sense, this study aims to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Goiânia, which processes wastewater from more than 700,000 inhabitants, and to correlate the molecular and clinical data collected. Influent and effluent samples were collected at Dr. Helio de Seixo Britto’s wastewater treatment plant from January to August 2021. Viral concentration was performed with polyethylene glycol before viral RNA extraction. Real-time qPCR (N1 and N2 gene assays) was performed to detect and quantify the viral RNA present in the samples. The results showed that 43.63% of the samples were positive. There is no significant difference between the detection of primers N1 (mean 3.23 log10 genome copies/L, std 0.23) and N2 (mean 2.95 log10 genome copies/L, std 0.29); also, there is no significant difference between the detection of influent and effluent samples. Our molecular data revealed a positive correlation with clinical data, and infection prevalence was higher than clinical data. In addition, we developed a user-friendly web application to predict the number of infected people based on the detection of viral load present in wastewater samples and may be applied as a public policy strategy for monitoring ongoing outbreaks.

However, if the patient presents to a hospital without pPCI capacity, and it is anticipated that pPCI cannot be performed within 120 min of first medical contact, fibrinolytic therapy is indicated (if there are no contraindications) (class I indication, level of evidence A). Our review of the pertinent literature shows that the current recommendation for inferior STEMI is based on the level of evidence lower than A.

Variability in TLR3 expression may play an important role in disease susceptibility of white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses, which are dsRNA viruses. Because little is known about TLR3 in WTD, our objective was to sequence WTD TLR3 mRNA and to determine baseline levels of tissue expression. A 209-base pair sequence of TLR3 mRNA was obtained from WTD peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dot blots confirmed that the sequence obtained was part of total WTD mRNA. Variable expression or ligand binding of TLR3 may contribute to observed susceptibility differences between populations of WTD, so the level of TLR3 in small intestine, skin, spleen, heart, cecum, rumen, lymph node, lung, kidney, and liver from WTD fawns (n=2) was analyzed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Fourteen of these 23 research objectives met the predefined threshold for selection and so were prioritised based on the following set of criteria: (1) the impact on ASF management; (2) the feasibility or practicality to carry out the study; (3) the potential implementation of study results in practice; (4) a possible short time‐frame study (< 1 year); (5) the novelty of the study; and (6) if it was a priority for risk managers. Finally, after further elimination of three of the proposed research objectives due to overlapping scope of studies published during the development of this opinion, 11 research priorities were elaborated into short research proposals, considering the potential impact on ASF management and the period of one year for the research activities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fpcJQf

medical,"BACKGROUND: South Africa has a high burden of perinatal common mental disorders (CMD), such as depression and anxiety, as well as high levels of poverty, food insecurity and domestic violence, which increases the risk of CMD. Yet public healthcare does not include routine detection and treatment for these disorders. This pilot study aims to evaluate the implementation outcomes of a health systems strengthening (HSS) intervention for improving the quality of care of perinatal women with CMD and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape Town. METHODS: Three antenatal care facilities were purposively selected for delivery of a HSS programme consisting of four components: (1) health promotion and awareness raising talks delivered by lay healthcare workers; (2) detection of CMD and domestic violence by nurses as part of routine care; (3) referral of women with CMD and domestic violence; and (4) delivery of structured counselling by lay healthcare workers in patients’ homes. Participants included healthcare workers tasked with delivery of the HSS components, and perinatal women attending the healthcare facilities for routine antenatal care. This mixed methods study used qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and pregnant women, a patient survey, observation of health promotion and awareness raising talks, and a review of several documents, to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, fidelity of delivery, and fidelity of receipt of the HSS components. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative interviews, while the quantitative findings for adoption and fidelity of receipt were reported using numbers and proportions. RESULTS: Healthcare workers found the delivery and content of the HSS components to be both acceptable and appropriate, while the feasibility, adoption and fidelity of delivery was poor. We demonstrated that the health promotion and awareness raising component improved women’s attitudes towards seeking help for mental health conditions. The detection, referral and treatment components were found to improve fidelity of receipt, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of women undergoing routine detection and referral, and decreased feelings of distress in women who received counselling. However, using a task-sharing approach did not prove to be feasible, as adding additional responsibilities to already overburdened healthcare workers roles resulted in poor fidelity of delivery and adoption of all the HSS components. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of receipt of the HSS programme components, and poor feasibility, fidelity of delivery and adoption suggest the need to appoint dedicated, lay healthcare workers to deliver key programme components, at healthcare facilities, on the same day.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",MrSrR_

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread non-essential business closures in the U.S., which may have disproportionately impacted food consumption in lower-income communities, in part due to reduced access to healthy and affordable foods, as well as occupations that may have required working outside the home. The aims of this study were to examine restaurant dining behaviors (including drive-through, takeout, and delivery) at fast-food and non-fast-food (i.e., fast casual and full-service [‘other’]) restaurants and the impact on diet quality among racially/ethnically diverse low-income adults during the early months of the pandemic. Participants completed an online survey using CloudResearch regarding restaurant dining behaviors in the past week (during June 2020) and during a typical week prior to the pandemic. Diet quality was measured using the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS). Surveys from 1,756 low-income adults (incomes <250% of the Federal Poverty Level) were analyzed using chi-squared tests to examine differences in demographic characteristics among those dining at restaurants during the pandemic, as well as to examine differences in dining frequency compared with prior to COVID-19. Negative binomial regressions were used to examine the mean frequency of eating food from fast-food and other restaurants, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. This study found reductions in fast-food and other restaurant dining compared with prior to COVID-19, although overall restaurant consumption remained high with over half of participants reporting fast-food consumption in the week prior (average consumption of twice per week). Greater fast-food consumption was associated with poorer diet quality. In conclusion, while fast-food consumption was slightly lower during the pandemic, the overall high levels observed among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults remains concerning, highlighting the continued need for initiatives and policies to encourage greater access to and consumption of affordable and healthier foods.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",c0u2iO

medical,"Background: From mid-March to mid-April 2020, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle suffered a COVID-19 outbreak. An investigation was performed to describe the outbreak, including how the virus was introduced on board. We present the clinical pictures of COVID-19 cases with risk factors for infection and severity, effectiveness of preventive measures, and we discuss the real collective protective rate.Methods: A confirmed case was any service member with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and/or who presented symptoms of anosmia and/or ageusia. We considered the entire crew as a cohort and questioned them about individual, epidemiological, and clinical data. We performed viral genome sequencing and searched for SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.Results: The attack rate was 65% (1085/1767). The sex ratio was 6·9, and median age was 29 years. There were four clinical profiles: asymptomatic (13·0%), non-specific symptomatic (8·1%), specific symptomatic (76·3%), and severe (i.e. requiring oxygen therapy, 2·6%). Active smoking prevented severe COVID-19;age and obesity were risk factors.The instantaneous reproduction rate Rt and viral sequencing supported the hypothesis of several introductions of the virus on board, with an acceleration of the Rt when preventive measures were lifted. Physical distancing prevented infection (ORa, 0·55, 95% CI, 0·40-0·76). In the end, transmission stopped when the proportion of infected personnel was large enough to prevent the virus from circulating (65%, 95% CI, 62-68).Discussion: Asymptomatic and non-specific clinical pictures of COVID-19, combined with a lack of knowledge at that time about the specific symptoms of COVID-19 (anosmia, ageusia), delayed detection of the outbreak. Once it was identified, the lack of an isolation ward made it difficult to manage transmission on board, and the outbreak spread until a collective protective rate was reached. However, physical distancing was effective when applied. Syndromic surveillance and point-of-care biology could enable early detection of such viral emergences or outbreaks.Funding Information: No funding to declare.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: This was not an experimental protocol, but an outbreak investigation with routine care provided to infected individuals, so no ethical approval from any named institutional and/or licensing/ethics committee was required. We obtained individual informed consent to analyze data. No administrative authorization was required to access and use medical records.

medical,"Objective: Perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease (CD) are the main challenges in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Some of the fistulas are refractory to any therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a novel promising modality for the treatment of fistulizing CD. Materials and Methods: This case series clinical interventional study was conducted from 2014 to 2017 at Shariati Hospital, an IBD referral center in Tehran, Iran. Refractory adult patients with CD who had draining perianal fistulas were enrolled in this study. All patients were examined by a colorectal surgeon and the fistula imaging studies were performed by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After autologous bone marrow (BM) aspiration and MSCs isolation, the cells were cultured and passaged under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) conditions. Four intra-fistula injections of cells, each containing 40×106 MSCs suspended in fibrin glue, were administered by an expert surgeon every 4 weeks. Procedure safety, feasibility and closure of the perianal fistulas at week 24 were assessed. Clinical examination and MRI findings were considered as the primary end points. Results: In total, 5 patients (2 males and 3 females) were enrolled in this study. No adverse events were observed during the six-month follow-up in these patients. Both the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) scores decreased in all patients after cell injections and one patient achieved complete remission with closure of fistulas, discontinuation of fistula discharge, and closure of the external opening. Conclusion: Local injection of MSCs combined with fibrin glue is potentially a safe and effective therapeutic approach for complex perianal fistulas in patients with CD.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BC8Y3_

medical,"OBJECTIVE: Globally, interest in excellence has grown exponentially, with public and private institutions shifting their attention from meeting targets to achieving excellence. Centres of Excellence (CoEs) are standing at the forefront of healthcare, research and innovations responding to the world’s most complex problems. However, their potential is hindered by conceptual ambiguity. We conducted a global synthesis of the evidence to conceptualise CoEs. DESIGN: Scoping review, following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and methodological enhancement by Levac et al and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Google engine until 1 January 2021. ELIGIBILITY: Articles that describe CoE as the main theme. RESULTS: The search resulted in 52 161 potential publications, with 78 articles met the eligibility criteria. The 78 articles were from 33 countries, of which 35 were from the USA, 3 each from Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and India, and 2 each from Ethiopia, Canada, Russia, Colombia, Sweden, Greece and Peru. The rest 17 were from various countries. The articles involved six thematic areas—healthcare, education, research, industry, information technology and general concepts on CoE. The analysis documented success stories of using the brand ‘CoE’—an inﬂuential brand to stimulate best practices. We identified 12 essential foundations of CoE—specialised expertise; infrastructure; innovation; high-impact research; quality service; accreditation or standards; leadership; organisational structure; strategy; collaboration and partnership; sustainable funding or financial mechanisms; and entrepreneurship. CONCLUSIONS: CoEs have significant scientific, political, economic and social impacts. However, there are inconsistent use and self-designation of the brand without approval by an independent, external process of evaluation and with high ambiguity between ‘CoEs’ and the ordinary ‘institutions’ or ‘centres’. A comprehensive framework is needed to guide and inspire an institution as a CoE and to help government and funding institutions shape and oversee CoEs.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",mDtIgm

medical,"Increased nasopharyngeal pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) colonization density has been associated with invasive pneumococcal disease, but factors that increase pneumococcal density are poorly understood. We evaluated pneumococcal densities in nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic young children from Peru and their association with subsequent acute respiratory illness (ARI). Total pneumococcal densities (encompassing all present serotypes) during asymptomatic periods were significantly higher when a respiratory virus was detected versus when no virus was detected (p<0.001). In adjusted analyses, increased pneumococcal density was significantly associated with the risk for a subsequent ARI (p<0.001), whereas asymptomatic viral detection alone was associated with lower risk for subsequent ARI. These findings suggest that interactions between viruses and pneumococci in the nasopharynx during asymptomatic periods might have a role in onset of subsequent ARI. The mechanisms for these interactions, along with other potentially associated host and environmental factors, and their role in ARI pathogenesis and pneumococcal transmission require further elucidation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Ep6eIj

medical,"Objective: To provide guidelines to healthcare workers for performing a focused neurological examination via telemedicine during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. Methods: We reviewed our department’s outpatient clinic visits after the implementation of a telemedicine protocol in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crossover rates from telehealth to in-person visits were evaluated and guidelines for performing a telemedicine neurological exam were created based on the consensus of 16 neurosurgical attending providers over a four-month period. Results: From March 23, 2020 to July 20, 2020, some 2157 telehealth visits were performed in our department. Some 26 were converted to in-person visits by the provider request with the most cited reason for conversion being the need for a more detailed patient evaluation. Based on these experiences, we created a graphical tutorial to address the key components of the neurological exam with adaptations specific to the telehealth visit. Conclusions: In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of neurosurgeons’ daily practice. Telemedicine failures remain low but primarily occur due to a need for more comprehensive evaluations. We provide guidelines for the neurosurgical exam during telehealth visits in an effort to assuage some of these issues.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UWAfDM

medical,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown could be considered a ‘perfect storm’ for increases in emotional distress. Such increases can only be identified by studies that use data collected before and during the pandemic. Longitudinal data are also needed to examine (1) the roles of previous distress and stressors in emotional distress during the pandemic and (2) how COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies are associated with emotional distress when pre-pandemic distress is accounted for. METHODS: Data came from a cohort study (N = 768). Emotional distress (perceived stress, internalizing symptoms, and anger), COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were measured during the pandemic/lockdown when participants were aged 22. Previous distress and stressors were measured before COVID-19 (at age 20). RESULTS: On average, participants showed increased levels of perceived stress and anger (but not internalizing symptoms) during the pandemic compared to before. Pre-COVID-19 emotional distress was the strongest predictor of during-pandemic emotional distress, followed by during-pandemic economic and psychosocial stressors (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions) and hopelessness, and pre-pandemic social stressors (e.g. bullying victimization and stressful life events). Most health risks to self or loved ones due to COVID-19 were not uniquely associated with emotional distress in final models. Coping strategies associated with reduced distress included keeping a daily routine, physical activity, and positive reappraisal/reframing. CONCLUSIONS: In our community sample, pre-pandemic distress, secondary consequences of the pandemic (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions), and pre-pandemic social stressors were more consistently associated with young adults' emotional distress than COVID-19-related health risk exposures.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tUH2hb

medical,"Previous literature has shown age-related increases in prosociality (i.e., the tendency to engage in behaviors that benefit others). Can such age-related differences be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, or would young adults’ higher levels of COVID-19-related stress alter the relation between age and prosociality given the prior findings that stress may promote prosocial behaviors? Can empathy, one of the factors highly related to prosociality, explain any observed age-related differences? The current study examined the above questions, as well as whether age differences exist in target of prosocial behaviors (i.e., distant- versus close-others). To this end, participants (aged 18-89) enrolled in an ongoing study examining their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were asked to complete a series of surveys on dispositional empathy and prosocial behaviors during the pandemic. In the present analyses, the data were used from 330 participants from the USA who completed all of the surveys. Compared to younger adults, results indicate that older adults showed greater prosocial behaviors during the pandemic despite their higher risk of physical-health complications from COVID-19. Unexpectedly, empathy did not explain such age-related increases in prosocial behaviors even though it was positively related to individuals’ prosociality. Interestingly, older adults reported increased prosocial behaviors towards close-others (i.e., family, friends) compared to young adults, suggesting that older adults seem to devote more resources into emotionally meaningful relationships. The current study contributes to our understanding of how prosociality differs with age during the stressful period of need that marks the COVID-19 pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_ojOl6

medical,"Objective of this study is to analyze the lockdown effect on economic activities in Nigeria as the lockdown response measure to COVID-19 pandemic claim to pose a serious and potentially long-term socio-economic threat to individuals households businesses as well as public sectors in Nigeria. This study considered four regions in Nigeria (Northwest North-Central South-South and Southeast) and adopted a quantitative research approach which entails systematic evaluation of individuals’ behavior towards an unprecedented economic shock and their response to the manner in which the situation might unfolds by lifting the lockdown measure in Nigeria. This is achievable with a systematic random sample and a well-structured survey questionnaire. All these regions experienced the imposition of lockdown measure by their respective state authorities. The results indicated that most socio-economic challenges including job loss increase social vices rise in poverty level fall in economic activities as well as fall in the level of GDP faced by individuals was not a resultant of the lockdown. Consequently, authority’s inefficiency was also challenged in spite of their efforts to mitigate and control the emerging economic consequences faced by households during the lockdown periods. The study recommends that lifting of lockdown would be the best action for the government to take for socio-economic resilience. The study also revealed that both public and individuals need to establish democratic preferences and trust on health professionals or experts.

medical,hello my name is ryan. I believe i may have seratonin syndrome . I was put on an anitdepressant called paxil for my anxiety. i started taking 5 mg for one week then i increased to 10 mg about two days after switching to the 10 i started to notice having a weird feeling i have never experienced before. i was feeling agitatied irrated depressed and very anxious and my nerves were on edge. i believed that it might be a side effect of the drug i tryied to push through it hearing that the side effects do go away after 4 days of this it became unbareable and i was so afraid that i quit taking it. the physical side effects went away within 2 days but i still felt aggition and depression and my anxiety was worse than before the medicine. i stopped taking it last tuesday. i told me doctor about this and he prescribed me a new antidepressant zoloft . both of the medications were generic brand. i took my first pill 25mg on this tuesday around noon. i did feel a little optimistic after taking it hoping it may help me. around 7 oclock that evening i started to feel this rush of fear and thoughts about all the bad things going on in my life. i started to panic and pace around my room crying and feeling like im going crazy. I ran outside to see if it would help but it didnt. I really wanted to go to the hospital but instead to calm me down i drank 2 glasses of whiskey in 20 mins. Ever since then i have become extremely aggitated and very anxious worse than before when i expeienced these symtoms on paxil. i wake up in the morning around 5 or 6 every day very anxious and racing thoughts. i fall asleep ok around midnight after being awake around 18 hours. In the past month me and my girlfriend broke up after being together for 2 years and i know it was because of my anxiety that our relationship failed. my car broke down so me and my dad are fixing it in his garage. ive been having problems at work because of my anxiety. Ive been smoking weed everyday for my anxiety over the past 2 years and just recently about a month ago decided to quit to get healthy and in shape. just everything pilling up it very overwhelming and depressing. i read online that seratonin syndrome can occur when you increase a dose in a ssri anitdepressant. Im wondering if my taking the zoloft agitated this and made my symtoms worse. I saw the doctor on thursday to tell him about this. he seemed he like he didnt know too much about mental health so he called a psychiatrist to fit me into an appointment on monday morning. in the mean time he prescribed me antivan to calm me down. i took the first pill thursday around 2 it was .5 mg. I didnt experience any change in my anxiety and mabye a less slightly aggitated but not enought to calm me down. i decided to up the dose to 1 mg too see if it would be any different i took that at 7 pm thursday evening after 2 hours of waiting for anything i didnt experience any change either. i became very upset and panicky becuase i thought something was seriously mentally wrong with me for this not to work. I had to resort to smoking marijuana just to calm my nerves and its my only option right now or going to the emergency room. im trying to hold on to seeing the psychiatrist on monday but im afraid it may effect my work this weekend i work at a resaurant and it really busy on the weekends.

medical,"In this paper, we study how different categories of crucial COVID-19 information influence price dynamics in stock and option markets during the period from 01/21/20 to 01/31/21. We present a theoretical model in which the behavioral traders make perceptual errors based on the intensity of sentiment arising from different types of news. In addition to the magnitude and direction of the news and its payoff relevance to security prices, other factors such as fear, emotion, and social media can influence the sentiment level. Using Google search data, we construct novel proxies for the sentiment levels induced by five categories of news, COVID, Market, Lockdown, Banking, and Government relief efforts. If the relative presence of behavioral traders in the stock market exceeds that in the option market, different predictions obtain for the effect of sentiment indices on jump volatility of the VIX index, the S&P 500 index, and the S&P 500 Banks index. We find that the jump component in the VIX index is increasing significantly with COVID index, Market index, Lockdown index, and Banking index. However, only COVID index and Market index increase the jump component of realized volatility of the stock indices (S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index). The Government relief efforts index decreases this jump component. Banking and Lockdown index reduce jump volatility in the S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index, but only with a delay of 5 days.

medical,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary antibody immunodeficiency, characterized by reduced serum levels of IgG, IgA, and/or IgM. The vast majority of CVID patients have polygenic inheritance. Immune dysfunction in CVID can frequently involve the gastrointestinal tract and lung. Few studies have started to investigate the gut microbiota profile in CVID patients. Overall, the results suggest that in CVID patients there is a reduction of alpha and beta diversity compared to controls. In addition, these patients can exhibit increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and markers (sCD14 and sCD25) of systemic immune cell activation. CVID patients with enteropathy exhibit decreased IgA expression in duodenal tissue. Mouse models for CVID unsatisfactorily recapitulate the polygenic causes of human CVID. The molecular pathways by which gut microbiota contribute to systemic inflammation and possibly tumorigenesis in CVID patients remain poorly understood. Several fundamental questions concerning the relationships between gut microbiota and the development of chronic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders or cancer in CVID patients remain unanswered.

medical,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a heritable cancer-predisposition syndrome with multiorgan involvement. Pancreatic lesions are detected in approximately two-thirds of patients with VHL disease at some point during their lifetime. In these patients, cystic pancreatic lesions are almost exclusively benign and, unless symptomatic, do not require surgical or endoscopic intervention; however, solid pancreatic lesions can often be recognized through imaging screens, and are commonly found to be nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) with malignant potential. The natural history of these VHL-associated pNETs is variable, and lacks clinical or imaging features that predict disease progression or metastatic potential, and generally needs to be managed more conservatively than their sporadic counterparts. Treatment options for such lesions, which range from active surveillance to surgical intervention, can nevertheless be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality. Of note, although several guidelines have been established for the management of tumours associated with VHL syndrome, none of these have specifically focused on pancreatic lesions. Thus, we aim to characterize the types of pancreatic lesions associated with VHL disease and their natural history, to identify particular lesions that necessitate treatment, and to define what forms of treatment should be undertaken.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WzuFFu
medical,"BACKGROUND Wavelet transformed reconstructions of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion (wavelet-MRP) are a new and elegant way of visualizing vascularization. Wavelet-MRP maps yield a clear depiction of hypervascular tumor regions, as recently shown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible connection of the wavelet-MRP power spectrum in glioblastoma (GBM) with local vascularity and cell proliferation. METHODS For this IRB-approved study 12 patients (63.0+/-14.9y; 7m) with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM were included. Target regions for biopsies were prospectively marked on tumor regions as seen on preoperative 3T MRI. During subsequent neurosurgical tumor resection 43 targeted biopsies were taken from these target regions, of which all 27 matching samples were analyzed. All specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for endothelial cell marker CD31 and proliferation marker Ki67 and correlated to the wavelet-MRP power spectrum as derived from DSC perfusion weighted imaging. RESULTS There was a strong correlation between wavelet-MRP power spectrum (median = 4.41) and conventional relative cerebral blood volume (median = 5.97 ml/100g) in Spearman's rank-order correlation (κ = .83, p < .05). In a logistic regression model, the wavelet-MRP power spectrum showed a significant correlation to CD31 dichotomized to no or present staining (p = .04), while rCBV did not show a significant correlation to CD31 (p = .30). No significant association between Ki67 and rCBV or wavelet-MRP was found (p = .62 and p = .70, respectively). CONCLUSION The wavelet-MRP power spectrum derived from existing DSC-MRI data might be a promising new surrogate for tumor vascularity in GBM.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ejPzCG

However, differences began to emerge in China, Italy, and South Korea after the second week. Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea. On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey. The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.

medical,"BACKGROUND: An innovative medical student elective combined student-directed, faculty-supported online learning with COVID-19 response field placements. This study evaluated students’ experience in the course, the curriculum content and format, and its short-term impact on students’ knowledge and attitudes around COVID-19. METHODS: Students responded to discussion board prompts throughout the course and submitted pre−/post-course reflections. Pre−/post-course questionnaires assessed pandemic knowledge and attitudes using 4-point Likert scales. Authors collected aggregate data on enrollment, discussion posts, field placements, and scholarly work resulting from course activities. After the elective, authors conducted a focus group with a convenience sample of 6 participants. Institutional elective evaluation data was included in analysis. Authors analyzed questionnaire data with summary statistics and paired t-tests comparing knowledge and attitudes before and after the elective. Reflection pieces, discussion posts, and focus group data were analyzed using content analysis with a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-seven students enrolled. Each student posted an average of 2.4 original discussion posts and 3.1 responses. Mean knowledge score increased from 43.8 to 60.8% (p < 0.001) between pre- and post-course questionnaires. Knowledge self-assessment also increased (2.4 vs. 3.5 on Likert scale, p < 0.0001), and students reported increased engagement in the pandemic response (2.7 vs. 3.6, p < 0.0001). Students reported increased fluency in discussing the pandemic and increased appreciation for the field of public health. There was no difference in students’ level of anxiety about the pandemic after course participation (3.0 vs. 3.1, p = 0.53). Twelve students (44.4%) completed the institutional evaluation. All rated the course “very good” or “excellent.” Students favorably reviewed the field placements, suggested readings, self-directed research, and learning from peers. They suggested more clearly defined expectations and improved balance between volunteer and educational hours. CONCLUSIONS: The elective was well-received by students, achieved stated objectives, and garnered public attention. Course leadership should monitor students’ time commitment closely in service-learning settings to ensure appropriate balance of service and education. Student engagement in a disaster response is insufficient to address anxiety related to the disaster; future course iterations should include a focus on self-care during times of crisis. This educational innovation could serve as a model for medical schools globally.

medical,"BACKGROUND Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a technique to evaluate intestinal perfusion based on the elaboration of the Indocyanine Green fluorescence signal. The aim of the study was to assess FLER's performances in evaluating perfusion in an animal model of long-lasting intestinal ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS An ischemic segment was created in 18 small bowel loops in 6 pigs. After 2 h (n = 6), 4 h (n = 6), and 6 h (n = 6), loops were evaluated clinically and by FLER to delineate five regions of interest (ROIs): ischemic zone (ROI 1), presumed viable margins (ROI 2a-2b), and vascularized areas (3a-3b). Capillary lactates were measured to compare clinical vs. FLER assessment. Basal (V 0 ) and maximal (V max) mitochondrial respiration rates were determined according to FLER. RESULTS Lactates (mmol/L) at clinically identified resection lines were significantly higher when compared to those identified by FLER (2.43 ± 0.95 vs. 1.55 ± 0.33 p = 0.02) after 4 h of ischemia. Lactates at 2 h at ROI 1 were 5.45 ± 2.44 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6 (2a-2b; p < 0.0001) vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 (3a-3b; p < 0.0001).

medical,"Undergraduate biology students often graduate without exposure to authentic research experiences. Laboratory courses follow a one or two week fail-proof experiment resembling a cookbook recipe, lacking the uncertainty of genuine research. Techniques in molecular biology cover an array of skills essential to succeed in a biotechnological laboratory today. I have been developing an evolving molecular biology lab course based on the teaching of concepts while imparting the skills and applications of modern techniques, providing students with theoretical concepts and laboratory skills. We prepare students to carry-out scientific protocols that can be applied to a future workforce setting. Students are immersed in a 10-week series of labs with the objective to use molecular cloning to make a novel gene therapy vector; therapies are designed to inhibit the expression of genes of the virus that causes Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Students are introduced to PubMed and GenBank to research the background of SARS-CoV-2 and its target genes; the Spike gene (S), the membrane gene (M) the nucleocapsid gene (N) and the envelope gene (E). Students use the DNA software, Serial Cloner, as a tool to evaluate DNA sequences and mFOLD to analyze RNA structure. Students generate and visualize the design of an antisense gene therapy directed against one of the target viral genes. Using our gene therapy platform, students generate a vector with a unique target. Subsequently student-generated vectors were transfected into mammalian tissue culture cells that express one of the target genes (S, M, N or E) and RNA and protein was collected to measure the efficacy of the gene therapy vector to reduce the expression of the target viral gene. In our initial experiments, we observed greater than 2.5-fold reduction in the Spike Covid mRNA. Currently, students are testing additional therapies to maximize efficacy.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",s2GLe9

Charts, just like statistical tests, are selected based on the objective of the study, the types of variable, and the statistical analyzes to be illustrated. Some of the most commonly used charts in clinical practice are frequency histograms, which illustrate qualitative variables or frequencies; also error charts, that are used for normally distributed quantitative variables; box plots or violin plots are used for distribution-free quantitative variables, and survival curves are for variables that include the person-time variable. The aforementioned charts can be used to illustrate the comparisons between maneuvers and outcome depending on the type of variable that is being analyzed. When two groups are compared and the dependent variable is dichotomous, forest plots are used; for multivariate models, the chart depends on the type of analysis. As for logistic regression and linear regression, tree diagrams are used; and scatter plots are used for linear regression. Survival plots are used for Cox proportional hazards. Although charts can be very useful, if they are misused, they can show differences where there are none, which leads to a misinterpretation of the studies.

Within 2.5 months (by March 18, 2020) over 191,127 COVID-19 patients have been identified in 161 countries. By then, over 700 pediatric patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 in China, with only about 58 diagnosed elsewhere. By now, there are thousands of children and adolescents infected. Chinese pediatricians would like to share their experience on how these patients were managed in China and the key recommendations that had guided them in meeting the evolving challenges. A group of experts were summoned by the Chinese Pediatric Society and Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics to extract informative data from a survey on confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in China. Consensus on diagnosis, management, and prevention of pediatric COVID-19 were drawn up based on the analysis of such data plus insights gained from the past SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The use of diagnostic laboratory tests is increasing worldwide. Improper test utilization (ITU) is a common problem for all healthcare systems as it costs substantial expenses for the health systems and impacts optimal patient care. PURPOSE: The present small-scale survey aims to highlight the current practice of ITU among the labs and physicians, and investigate the actions of diagnostic laboratories towards ITU, and identify the reasons affecting test ordering decisions among physicians. METHODS: A cross sectional study based on two different surveys was developed and distributed from March 2017 to April 2017 to laboratory supervisors and physicians (clinicians) at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Qatar. Fourteen laboratory supervisors and eighty-nine physicians were surveyed about improper test utilization practices. The overall results are descriptive data. RESULTS: The overall proportion of improperly utilized tests detected by the laboratory supervisors were 50.0%, 35.7%, and 14.3% for overused, misused, and underused lab tests, respectively. Among the physicians, 91% used the electronic ordering template to select the appropriate tests. Moreover, 78.7% of the physicians used the clinical guidelines, while 73% were not employing the laboratory handbook. Furthermore, 95.5%% of the physicians preferred to get feedback about inappropriate tests, while 51.1% were not receiving any, and 40.9% were rarely receiving. Finally, 67.4% were unaware of the tests’ costs among surveyed physicians, and 63.6% showed a willingness to reduce their orders if the cost was high and unnecessary. CONCLUSION: The physician’s and the laboratories’ communication were inadequate and not systematized, causing ITU practices. The improvement strategy should focus on the communication between clinical labs and physicians and enhance physician implementation to order appropriate lab tests. This could be achieved by conducting legitimate educational methodologies, continuous feedback reviews, ongoing audits, executing health information technology instruments, engaging laboratory practice guidelines, and applying demand management and testing algorithms.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",LGUB2K

medical,"OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess the malnutrition parameters among school children in a rural school near Mumbai, India. A nutritional intervention was carried out by supplementing high protein foods to the midday meal to study its impact on stunting and wasting parameters. METHODS: In January 2020, anthropometric measurements of 60 students from a rural school located in Neral, Maharashtra were taken. The age, height (cm), and weight (kg) of 60 students were recorded and analyzed. In addition to the midday meal, 2 eggs were supplied every day to every student from 1st-5th grade and one egg to students from 6th-8th grade. It was made compulsory that any student who was stunted or wasted, independent of their age/grade, had to have two eggs a day. This was continued routinely from Monday through Saturday and at the end of three months, the same data was collected. RESULTS: The anthropometric measurements of all the students were taken in the month of January 2020 and the beginning of April 2020 (the school was prematurely shut down due to COVID-19 lockdown). In January, after assessing the anthropometric it was concluded that out of 60 children, 19 students were underweight, 9 were stunted, and 14 were wasted. Additionally, 3 were overweight/obese. In April, it was observed that only 12 students were underweight, a 37% decrease in number of underweight students. The was a significant decline in the number of stunted students which went down to 2 students, a 78% decrease. The number of wasted students fell to 11, showing a 21% decrease. The number of obese students fell by 50%, causing the number of overweight students to rise. CONCLUSIONS: The three-month data is considerably encouraging as it shows a significant decrease in the number of wasted undernourished and stunted students in a short period of time. This implies that the high protein diet can be helpful in significantly alter the stunting prevalent in rural school children. Although this study was conducted on a smaller scale, the significant decrease in stunted students consuming two eggs a day shows the effectiveness of protein supplementation.

MHL was assessed using the Mental Health Literacy Scale for Healthcare Students. A paired sample t-test was performed to examine the immediate and delayed effects of the MHL curriculum. The total MHL score significantly improved, and a moderate effect size was found directly after the intervention and six weeks later. There were significant differences in the recognition of mental illness (p < 0.01), help-seeking efficacy (p < 0.05), and help-seeking attitude (p < 0.05) in the five components of MHL between pre- and post-test. Furthermore, significant improvements were obtained for the maintenance of positive mental health (p < 0.05) and reduction of mental illness stigma (p < 0.001) between the pre-test and follow-up.

medical,"Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group.

medical,"COVID-19 is an unprecedented global pandemic. On 12 March 2020, a lockdown order was issued in Italy in attempt to contain the health crisis. The study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on diet, physical activity, sleep quality, and distress in an Italian cohort. An online anonymous interview, which included validated questionnaires was created to compare lifestyle habits pre- and during the lockdown. Data analysis from 604 subjects with a mean age of 29.8 years was carried out using multivariate analysis. Compared to pre-COVID-19 times, 67% of people changed their eating habits and increased consumption of foods containing added sugars. Women and men with low adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) were more likely to be physically inactive (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Results from logistic regression showed a three times higher risk of being inactive if adherence to the MedDiet was low (p < 0.0001), especially in men between 26 and 35 years. Lower levels of distress were reported in males who were physically active (89%) (p < 0.001).

medical,"Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been widely adopted as cathode in sodium ion battery devices. Nevertheless, the weak intrinsic conductivity and serious structural collapse limit the further development. Herein, a simultaneous modified strategy of doping K/Co and integrating carbon quantum dots (CQD) is proposed. Substituting K+ is beneficial to afford amount of Na+ transport within the stabled and expanded lattice. The introduction of Co2+ generates beneficial hole carriers to improve conductivity. Furthermore, the bonding of conductive CQD guides to obtain nano-sized NVP grains, reducing the pathway for ionic migration to accelerate the diffusion capability. Importantly, a unique p-n type heterojunction construction is established in the interface between CQD (n-type) and NVP (p-type). This heterojunction structure enhances the mobility of electrons owing to the free pathways, in which the electrons transport in a relatively lower energy level without the scatter and collision of anions dopants. Ultimately, K0.1Na2.95V1.95Co0.05(PO4)3@CQD exhibits with the best energy output level. It's initial capacity under 5C is 109.8 mA h g-1 and the retention is 87.6% after cycle 400 cycles.

medical,"Background Diabetes has been a major source of disease burden in Canada. Moreover, untreated diabetes can lead to complications and severe conditions. A few studies exist on the prevalence of diabetes and the adequacy of diabetes management for the Canadian population, and so this study aims to estimate the diabetes prevalence rates using biomarkers and the treatment statuses of non-institutionalized Canadian patients. Methods The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) cycles 1 to 4 were conducted between 2007 and 2015 as interviews with non-institutionalized Canadians. Four blood diabetic markers were measured: insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin percentages, random-spot glucose, and fasting glucose. Subjects with levels higher than normal ranges were considered to have pre-diabetes or diabetes. Treatment statuses were categorized into treated (using anti-diabetic agents or diagnosed with diabetes), probably treated (taking prescriptions or diagnosed with chronic conditions), potentially treated (taking any medications or diagnosed with chronic conditions), and untreated (not taking any medications and not diagnosed with chronic conditions). Weights were applied to generate nationally representative statistics. Results The blood insulin levels in cycle 4 were significantly higher than those in cycle 1 (ratio = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.79). The proportions of patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes were estimated differently at 0.75% using random-spot glucose and 42.17% using glycosylated hemoglobin percentages, respectively. The proportions of Canadians with uncontrolled pre-diabetes or diabetes varied from 0.59% using random-spot glucose levels to 4.63% using fasting glucose levels, respectively. Through cycles 1 to 4, the proportions of untreated Canadians with pre-diabetes or diabetes ranged from 3.86% to 3.73%. More than 93% of those with high fasting glucose levels were taking prescription medications or had been diagnosed with chronic conditions (probably treated). Less than 33% of those with high fasting glucose levels were diagnosed or actively being treated with anti-diabetic agents (treated). Conclusion Diabetes biomarkers might be useful for screening untreated and undertreated patients with pre-diabetes or diabetes. The treatment categories we used indicated different intensities of intervention that might be useful for determining levels of patient outreach and for planning targeted screening in Canada.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zseN-e

medical,"BACKGROUND: In the global chronic diseases, type 2 diabetes shows a significant upward trend, and there are more people before prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance). Many patients with impaired glucose tolerance and undiagnosed diabetes do not know that their glucose metabolism system has been in a state of disorder. Every year, about 5% to 10% of prediabetics develop diabetes. One of the important achieving factors may be the increase in blood lipids. However, it is not clear whether the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in the Chinese population. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein and impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in the Chinese population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the health screening program. The study included 116,855 participants from 32 locations in China, all of whom were adults over 20. Participants measured fasting blood glucose levels at each visit and collected information about their diabetes history. Impaired glucose tolerance was diagnosed as fasting blood glucose ≥6.00 mmol and self-reported diabetes mellitus. The patient was measured on the date of diagnosis or on his last visit (whichever comes first). RESULTS: The results showed that, after adjusting the potential confounding factors, the ratio of TG/HDL was positively correlated with the occurrence of prediabetes and diabetes, and there was a saturation effect. The inflection points were 1.04 and 1.33, respectively. The effect value and 95% confidence interval before and after the inflection point of impaired glucose tolerance patients were 1.57 and (1.42, 1.73) and 1.03 and (1.01, 1.05), respectively.

Thus, we analysed prospective data of stroke alerts referred to our stroke centre between 1 December 2019 and 16 June 2020, and compared them between two periods-15 weeks before and 13 weeks during the state-wide lockdown declared in Lithuania on 16 March 2020. Among 719 referrals for suspected stroke, there was a decrease in stroke alerts (rate ratio 0.61, 95% CI (0.52-0.71)), stroke admissions (0.63, 95% CI (0.52-0.76)), and decrease in prehospital stroke triage quality (positive predictive value 72.1% vs. 79.9%, p = 0.042) during the lockdown. The onset-to-door time was longer (153.0 vs. 120.5 min, p = 0.049) and seizures and intracranial tumours were more common among stroke mimics (16.9% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.012 and 9.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.037, respectively). We conclude that there was a decline in prehospital stroke triage quality during the lockdown despite low COVID-19 incidence in the country.

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performed in patients with a history of COVID-19, comparing subjects according to the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed. Consecutive patients > 18 years with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test and a CPET performed between 45 and 120 days after the viral episode were included. The association between variables related to CPET and post-COVID-19 syndrome was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 200 patients (mean age 48.8 ± 14.3 years, 51% men) were included. Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome showed significantly lower main peak VO(2) (25.8 ± 8.1 mL/min/Kg vs. 28.8 ± 9.6 mL/min/Kg, p=0.017) as compared to asymptomatic subjects. Moreover, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome developed symptoms more frequently during CPET (52.7% vs. 13.7%, p<0.001) and were less likely to reach the anaerobic threshold (50.9% vs. 72.7%, p=0.002) when compared to asymptomatic subjects. These findings were not modified when adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Our data suggest that post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with less peak VO(2), a lower probability of achieving the anaerobic threshold and a higher probability of presenting symptoms during the CPET. Future studies are needed to determine if these abnormalities during CPET would have prognostic value.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",z967ft

medical,"Prospective planning of COVID-19 vaccines allocation will be essential to maximize public health and societal benefits while preserving equity. Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7–39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9–27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PKqsyt

The COVID-19 pandemic, which has been rampant since 2020, has caused anxiety and stress in the population. Distancing measures to combat the pandemic have affected mental health. Our objective was to examine the impact of the 3rd lockdown in Germany in December 2020 and January 2021 on the apprehension of patients with FD and IBS.Patients diagnosed with FD or IBS treated in a tertiary or primary care hospital in the South of Baden-Württemberg in 2020 voluntarily participated in an anonymous online survey. Questions about concomitant diseases, concern about COVID-19 and stress perception were answered.A total of 106 patients (♀=67, ♂=38, 1 diverse) participated in the survey. Of these, 16 had FD (♀=9, ♂=6, diverse=1), 80 had IBS (♀=52, ♂=28), and 10 had both (♀=6, ♂=4). The average age was 43.6 years. Depressive and anxiety disorders were most frequently reported comorbidities in both the FD (25% each) and IBS group (20% each), followed by joint wear and tear (FD: 13%, RDS: 14%). In a direct comparison of participants with FD and IBS, those with IBS showed significantly higher scores for an increase in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during the pandemic (p=0.007), more frequent presentation to a physician during the pandemic, and greater social withdrawal due to GI symptoms (p=0.05). In direct comparison, those with IBS showed higher scores for fear that vaccination against COVID-19 would adversely affect GI symptoms compared to FD (p=0.05).In times of the pandemic, interdisciplinary collaboration in the care of patients with FD or IBS seems more necessary than ever to address concerns and provide good patient care.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rUhS6F

We reviewed the NZ RF surveillance sector, aiming to identify potential improvements which would support optimal RF control and prevention activities. METHODS: This review used a recently developed surveillance sector review method. Interviews with 36 key informants were used to describe the sector, assess it and identify its gaps. Priorities for improvement and implementation strategies were determined following discussion with these key informants, with policy advisors and within the research team. RESULTS: Key improvements identified included the need for a comprehensive RF surveillance strategy, integrated reporting and an online national RF register. At a managerial level this review provided evidence for system change and built support for this across the surveillance sector. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance sector review approach can be added to the small set of tools currently available for developing and evaluating surveillance systems.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression including high-dose calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) is essential after lung transplantation. Dosing is usually guided by therapeutic drug monitoring adjusted to target trough levels of CNIs to keep the balance between over-dose causing severe toxicity and increased risk of infections or under-dose with a risk of graft injury. Adaptation of CNI-based immunosuppression by monitoring of torque teno virus (TTV), a latent nonpathogenic DNA virus, measured in the whole blood in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring may reduce the toxicity of immunosuppression with similar efficacy. METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial in lung transplant recipients will be conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring as an add-on to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring. Adult lung transplant recipients 21 to 42 days after transplantation are eligible to participate. Patients (N = 144) will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental intervention (arm 1: immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels) and control intervention (arm 2: conventional therapeutic drug monitoring). Outcomes will be assessed 12 months after randomization with the change in glomerular filtration rate as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be additional measurements of renal function, allograft function, incidence of acute rejections, incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, graft loss, and infections. DISCUSSION: The results of this randomized controlled trial may reduce the toxicity of immunosuppression after lung transplantation while maintaining the efficacy of immunosuppression.

medical,"Background: Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Results: SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",TS3j-e

The rapid spread of COVID-19 necessitates the development of cost-effective technology platforms for the production of vaccines, drugs, and protein reagents for appropriate disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explored the possibility of producing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and an anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR3022 in Nicotiana benthamiana. Both RBD and mAb CR3022 were transiently produced with the highest expression level of 8 µg/g and 130 µg/g leaf fresh weight respectively at 3 days post-infiltration. The plant-produced RBD exhibited specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the plant-produced mAb CR3022 binds to SARS-CoV-2, but fails to neutralize the virus in vitro. This is the first report showing the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and mAb CR3022 in plants. Overall these findings provide a proof-of-concept for using plants as an expression system for the production of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies or similar other diagnostic reagents against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly, especially during epidemic or pandemic situation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",L3L4KY

medical,"Background Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at the local, national, and international levels were directed primarily to mitigate the spread of the disease. However, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health were not thoroughly investigated yet, and studies that report the mental health risks of COVID-19 are still scarce. Objectives This study aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated national measures. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P=0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress scores (P=0.0013). Concerning severity, most of the respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P= 0.035), (P=0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P<0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was Spending more time on social media (n=269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-10 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern. Conclusion The COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.

medical,"INTRODUCTION Efficient pain management by nursing staff initially needs accurate knowledge and proper attitude in this field. The aim of present study was to compare the effects of lecture and electronic education on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of nursing staff regarding pain management. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present superiority randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms was conducted on 78 occupied nurses of surgery wards of X. The participants were recruited randomly and divided into two groups of lecture and electronic education through random blocking (4 and 6 blocks). For allocation concealment, coded nontransparent pockets numbered 1-78 containing the type of intervention were used. Educational material was presented using teacher-centered method in lecture group, as well as through multimedia program using FLASH software in e-learning group through 1-h sessions for 4 weeks. Data on nurses were collected before and 4 weeks after the training using demographic questionnaire, Pain Management Principles Assessment Tool, Nurses' Attitude Survey, and nursing practice checklist. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24) utilizing descriptive and analytic statistical test such as Chi-square, Fisher, independent t-test, and ANCOVA. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Mean ± standard deviation of nurses' knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding pain management had significant increase in both groups post-training (P < 0.001). According to ANCOVA the mean postintervention knowledge score in e-learning group by controlling baseline score had significant increase compared to the lecture group (adjusted mean difference [aMD] = 1.8: 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-2.1, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean of total scores of post-intervention attitude and practice in e-learning group adjusted for baseline score significantly increased compared to lecture group (aMD = 1.8: 95% CI = 1.5-2.1, P < 0.001) and (aMD = 3.2: 95% CI = 2.7-3.6, P < 0.001).

medical,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people's sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic, and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. CONCLUSION: During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China. Li W, Li G, Xin C, et al.

medical,"Globally, there is an urgency to develop effective, low-cost therapeutic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We previously generated the stable and ultrapotent homotrimeric Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 (PiN-21). Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation treatment quickly reverses animals’ weight loss after infection, decreases lung viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology, and prevents viral pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production cost, this innovative therapy may provide a convenient and cost-effective option to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6bO64s
medical,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a fatal epizootic swine coronavirus that presents a financial threat to the global swine industry. Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018-19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018-2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",G4snMX

The goal of this study was to explore the mediating role of resilience and life satisfaction in the relationship between perceived stress and burnout among medical students in the context of COVID-19. A transversal assessment was performed using an online questionnaire, to which 462 students responded. The instruments applied were the Perceived Stress Scale-10, the Resilience Scale-25 items, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Burnout Scale (Oldenburg Inventory). A regression model was estimated for each dimension of burnout. The results revealed that resilience and life satisfaction play a mediating role in the association between stress and the dimensions of burnout.

medical,"Contacts between people are the absolute drivers of contagious respiratory infections. For this reason, limiting and tracking contacts is a key strategy for the control of the COVID-19 epidemic. Digital contact tracing has been proposed as an automated solution to scale up traditional contact tracing. However, the required penetration of contact tracing apps within a population to achieve a desired target in the control of the epidemic is currently under discussion within the research community. In order to understand the effects of digital contact tracing, several mathematical models have been proposed. In this article, we survey the main ones and we propose a compartmental SEIR model with which it is possible, differently from the models in the related literature, to derive closed-form conditions regarding the control of the epidemic as a function of the contact tracing apps penetration and the testing efficiency. Closed-form conditions are crucial for the understandability of models, and thus for decision makers (including digital contact tracing designers) to correctly assess the dependencies within the epidemic. With our model, we find that digital contact tracing alone can rarely tame an epidemic: for unrestrained COVID-19, this would require a testing turnaround of around 1 day and app uptake above 80% of the population, which are very difficult to achieve in practice. However, digital contact tracing can still be effective if complemented with other mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and mask-wearing.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pAPAtz

medical,"Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HtwCRB

medical,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the ability of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers to maintain personal safety during the treatment and transport of patients potentially infected. Increased rates of COVID-19 infection in EMS providers after patient care exposure, and notably after performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), have been reported. With an already strained workforce seeing rising call volumes and increased risk for AGP-requiring patient presentations, development of novel devices for the protection of EMS providers is of great importance.Based on the concept of a negative pressure room, the AerosolVE BioDome is designed to encapsulate the patient and contain aerosolized infectious particles produced during AGPs, making the cabin of an EMS vehicle safer for providers. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the tent in mitigating simulated infectious particle spread in varied EMS transport platforms during AGP utilization. METHODS Fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled and distributed amongst three EMS vehicles: a ground ambulance, an aeromedical-configured helicopter, and an aeromedical-configured jet. Sodium chloride particles were used to simulate infectious particles and particle counts were obtained in numerous locations close to the tent and around the patient compartment. Counts near the tent were compared to ambient air with and without use of AGPs (non-rebreather mask, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] mask, and high-flow nasal cannula [HFNC]). RESULTS For all transport platforms, with the tent fan off, the particle generator alone, and with all AGPs produced particle counts inside the tent significantly higher than ambient particle counts (P <.0001). With the tent fan powered on, particle counts near the tent, where EMS providers are expected to be located, showed no significant elevation compared to baseline ambient particle counts during the use of the particle generator alone or with use of any of the AGPs across all transport platforms. CONCLUSION Development of devices to improve safety for EMS providers to allow for use of all available therapies to treat patients while reducing risk of communicable respiratory disease transmission is of paramount importance. The AerosolVE BioDome demonstrated efficacy in creating a negative pressure environment and workspace around the patient and provided significant filtration of simulated respiratory droplets, thus making the confined space of transport vehicles potentially safer for EMS personnel.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UO1_53

While various approaches have been published online to tackle this problem, our work presents a systematic study with comprehensive quantitative analysis of different deep learning models on multiple datasets. We experimented with two types of one-stage pedestrian detection models and further optimised their performance with a repulsion loss to address occlusions in crowds. We also propose a distance computation technique with locally adaptive threshold to approximate the actual spatial distance between pedestrians in the real world. In addition, since there is no existing dataset providing ground truth annotations of distances, we manually annotated three public datasets with such information to perform quantitative evaluation of our crowd detection method.

medical,"Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus. This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the “big picture” of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years. A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6PdiqE

medical,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) provides the reducing agent NADPH to meet the cellular needs for reductive biosynthesis and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE(2) occurred upon TNF-α stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF-α-induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-κB. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF-α treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF-α-mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF-α-mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",N0qYx3

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide. The HCC generally develops in the liver of patients already suffering from chronic liver disease. There have been significant advances in both the curative and palliative treatment of HCC. Although liver resection is a curative treatment for HCC, its indication is often limited due to an impaired liver function reservoir. There is still a need to understand how to control liver regeneration after resection and find better cancer immunotherapy and anticancer drugs for advanced HCC. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) negatively regulate cytokine signaling related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune response; therefore, SOCS are thought to play an important role in HCC development and liver regeneration. ABSTRACT: Cytokines are secreted soluble glycoproteins that regulate cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins negatively regulate cytokine signaling and form a classical negative feedback loop in the signaling pathways. There are eight members of the SOCS family. The SOCS proteins are all comprised of a loosely conserved N-terminal domain, a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a highly conserved SOCS box at the C-terminus. The role of SOCS proteins has been implicated in the regulation of cytokines and growth factors in liver diseases. The SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins are involved in immune response and inhibit protective interferon signaling in viral hepatitis. A decreased expression of SOCS3 is associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DNA methylations of SOCS1 and SOCS3 are found in HCC. Precise regulation of liver regeneration is influenced by stimulatory and inhibitory factors after partial hepatectomy (PH), in particular, SOCS2 and SOCS3 are induced at an early time point after PH. Evidence supporting the important role of SOCS signaling during liver regeneration also supports a role of SOCS signaling in HCC. Immuno-oncology drugs are now the first-line therapy for advanced HCC. The SOCS can be potential targets for HCC in terms of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and immune response. In this literature review, we summarize recent findings of the SOCS family proteins related to HCC and liver diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",H9O_F7
medical,"BACKGROUND: The use of data in targeting malaria control efforts is essential for optimal use of resources. This work provides a practical mechanism for prioritizing geographic areas for insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution campaigns in settings with limited resources. METHODS: A GIS-based weighted approach was adopted to categorize and rank administrative units based on data that can be applied in various country contexts where Plasmodium falciparum transmission is reported. Malaria intervention and risk factors were used to rank local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria for prioritization during mass ITN distribution campaigns. Each factor was assigned a unique weight that was obtained through application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weight was then multiplied by a value based on natural groupings inherent in the data, or the presence or absence of a given intervention. Risk scores for each factor were then summated to generate a composite unique risk score for each LGA. This risk score was translated into a prioritization map which ranks each LGA from low to high priority in terms of timing of ITN distributions. RESULTS: A case study using data from Nigeria showed that a major component that influenced the prioritization scheme was ITN access. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that changes to the methodology used to quantify ITN access did not modify outputs substantially. Some 120 LGAs were categorized as ‘extremely high’ or ‘high’ priority when a spatially interpolated ITN access layer was used. When prioritization scores were calculated using DHS-reported state level ITN access, 108 (90.0%) of the 120 LGAs were also categorized as being extremely high or high priority. The geospatial heterogeneity found among input risk factors suggests that a range of variables and covariates should be considered when using data to inform ITN distributions. CONCLUSION: The authors provide a tool for prioritizing regions in terms of timing of ITN distributions. It serves as a base upon which a wider range of vector control interventions could be targeted. Its value added can be found in its potential for application in multiple country contexts, expediated timeframe for producing outputs, and its use of systematically collected malaria indicators in informing prioritization.

medical,"Pure and drinkable water will be rarer and more expensive as the result of pollution induced by industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth. Among the numerous sources of water pollution, the textile industry has become a major issue because effluents containing dyes are often released in natural water bodies. For instance, about two years are needed to biodegrade dye-derived, carcinogenic aromatic amines, in sediments. Classical remediation methods based upon physicochemical reactions are costly and still generate sludges that contain amine residues. Nonetheless, recent research shows that nanomaterials containing biopolymers are promising to degrade organic pollutants by photocatalysis. Here, we review the synthesis and applications of biopolymeric nanomaterials for photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes. We focus on conducting biopolymers incorporating metal, metal oxide, metal/metal oxide and metal sulphide for improved biodegradation. Biopolymers can be obtained from microorganisms, plants and animals. Unlike fossil-fuel-derived polymers, biopolymers are carbon neutral and thus sustainable in the context of global warming.

To date we lack a marker to unify mononuclear phagocytes in humans or that informs us about their origin. Here, we reassess Mononuclear Phagocyte ontogeny in human blood through the lineage receptor CSF1R, in the steady state and in COVID-19. We define CSF1R as the first sensitive and reproducible pan-phagocyte lineage marker, to identify and enumerate all conventional monocytes, and the myeloid dendritic cells. In the steady state CSF1R is sufficient for sorting and immuno-magnetic isolation. In pathology, changes in CSF1R are more sensitive than CD14 and CD16. In COVID-19, a significant drop in membrane CSF1R is useful for stratifying patients, beyond the power of cell categories published thus far, which fail to capture COVID-19 specific events. Importantly, CSF1R defines cells which are neither conventional monocytes nor DCs, which are missed in published analysis. CSF1R decrease can be linked ex vivo to high CSF1 levels. Blood assessment of CSF1R+ cells opens a developmental window to the Mononuclear Phagocyte System in transit from bone marrow to tissues, supports isolation and phenotypic characterisation, identifies novel cell types, and singles out CSF1R inhibition as therapeutic target in COVID-19 and other diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",s7xeZ2

BIPOC/Latinx people have undergone hospitalizations and death at magnitudes greater than White people in the US. The untold second casualties are health care workers that are suffering from increased risk of infection, death, and mental health crisis. Many health care workers are abandoning the profession all together. Although Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) mean to guide the ethical allocation of scare resources, they frequently use scoring systems that are inherently biased. This raises concern for the application of equity in CSC. Data examining the impact of these protocols on health equity is scarce. Structural maltreatment in healthcare and inequities have led to cumulative harms, physiologic weathering and structural adversities for residents of the US. We propose the use of Restorative Justice (RJ) practices to develop CSC rooted in inclusion and equity. The RJ framework utilizes capacity building, circle process, and conferences to convene groups in a respectful environment for dialogue, healing, accountability, and action plan creation. A phased, non-faith-based facilitated RJ approach for CSC development (or revision) that fosters ethically equitable resource distribution, authentic community engagement, and accountability is shared. This opportunity for local, inclusive decision making and problem solving will both reflect the needs and give agency to community members while supporting the dismantling of structural racism and oppressive, exclusive policies.

Because abdominal pain can indicate a number of problems, your doctor will need to rule out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely start with a physical examination, including checking your abdomen for tenderness. Women, in addition, generally have a pelvic examination to rule out pelvic disease. After that, your doctor will likely recommend: - Blood and urine tests, to check for signs of infection. - Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, to rule out pregnancy as a cause of abdominal pain. - Liver function tests, to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. - Stool test, to rule out infection in people who have diarrhea. - CT scan, which can indicate inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment.

medical,"Contributing to the literature on aptitude-treatment interactions between worked examples and problem-solving, this paper addresses differential learning from the two approaches when students are positioned as domain experts learning new concepts. Our evaluation is situated in a team project that is part of an advanced software engineering course. In this course, students who possess foundational domain knowledge but are learning new concepts engage alternatively in programming followed by worked example-based reflection. They are either allowed to finish programming or are curtailed after a pre-specified time to participate in a longer worked example-based reflection. We find significant pre- to post-test learning gains in both conditions. Then, we not only find significantly more learning when students participated in longer worked example-based reflections but also a significant performance improvement on a problem-solving transfer task. These findings suggest that domain experts learning new concepts benefit more from worked example-based reflections than from problem-solving.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-3uuCP

medical,"To realize a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the dose of low molecular weight heparin to be administered, preventing thromboembolism events in COVID-19 patients with active cancer. Methods: We used a dataset comprising 131 patients with active cancer and COVID-19. We considered five ML models: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and Gaussian naive Bayes. We decided to implement the logistic regression model for our study. A model with 19 variables was analyzed. Data were randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Model performance was assessed by confusion matrix metrics on the testing data for each model as positive predictive value, sensitivity and F1-score. Results: We showed that the five selected models outperformed classical statistical methods of predictive validity and logistic regression was the most effective, being able to classify with an accuracy of 81%. The most relevant result was finding a patient-proof where python function was able to obtain the exact dose of low weight molecular heparin to be administered and thereby to prevent the occurrence of VTE. Conclusions: The world of machine learning and artificial intelligence is constantly developing. The identification of a specific LMWH dose for preventing VTE in very high-risk populations, such as the COVID-19 and active cancer population, might improve with the use of new training ML-based algorithms.

medical,"Background and Objectives: Providing a proper quality control of drugs is essential for efficient treatment of various diseases minimizing the possible side effects of pharmaceutical active substances and potential impurities. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that certain heavy metalloids and metals interfere with protein folding of nascent proteins in cells and their biological function can be altered. It is unknown whether the drug impurities including heavy metals may affect the tertiary protein structure. Materials and Methods: ReciGen and Rebif are pharmaceutical interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a) contained in preparations that are used for parenteral administration. Heavy metal impurities of these samples have been studied by gel electrophoresis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis (ICP MS). The concentration of heavy metals including mercury, arsenic, nickel, chromium, iron, and aluminum did not exceed permitted levels established by International Council for Harmonisation guideline for elemental impurities. Results: The ICP MS analysis revealed the presence of heavy metals, moreover zeta potential was significantly different for IFNβ-1a, which can be an indirect indication of the difference in composition of ReciGen and Rebif samples, respectively. FTIR analysis revealed very similar amide I and II bonds at 1654 and 1560 cm(−1) attributed to the peptide absorption peaks of IFNβ-1a in Rebif and ReciGen. Conclusions: It was hypothesized that the IFNβ-1a complex binds heavy metals affecting the tertiary protein structure and may lead to some side effects of drug administration. Further testing of IFNβ-1a bioequivalence for parenteral application is necessary.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pkOlpl
medical,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) represents the only minimally invasive approach for treatment of Dupuytren's disease in Europe since withdrawal of collagenase from European markets. Though well-established, surgeon preference and uncertainty regarding safety and efficacy, results in limited provision in favour of open fasciectomy. METHODS: A retrospective review of 74 patients who self-opted to receive PNF between 2017 and 2020 was conducted. Demographic data, complications and degree of release achieved were compared across three cohorts based on contracture severity as per Tubiana staging (TS): Stage 1, 0–45°; Stage 2, 46–90°; Stage 3, 91–130° with χ(2) analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen rays were treated amongst 74 patients (mean age, 68 years (R, 32–86), males: 74%) with mean follow-up 51 weeks (IQR 28–76 weeks) with no significant difference in baseline characteristics across cohorts. No cases of permanent sensory disturbance, flexor tendon rupture, arterial transection nor infection were observed. Neuropraxia was seen in six patients, resolving with mean recovery of 6 weeks. 86% (n = 166) of joints had satisfactory release (residual passive extension deficit (PED) ≤10°) with full release in 67%. Full release was most likely in metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ; 93%) than distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ; 67%) or proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ; 45%; p<0.0001). Mean release was 54° in MCPJ and 56° in PIPJ. All TS1 patients achieved release with ≤10° residual PED versus 75% of TS2 patients and 22% of TS3 patients (p<0.05), the latter of whom had a mean residual PED of 12° Ninety-two percent of patients stated they would undergo PNF again if necessary, in preference to open fasciectomy. CONCLUSION: We find PNF to facilitate a safe, effective yet minimally invasive approach amongst patients of varying disease severity, across different age groups, with recurrent disease, associated comorbidities or concurrent anticoagulation therapy. Patients reported high satisfaction in preference to open procedures. We, therefore, intend to recommend PNF first-line to all patients regardless of disease severity.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",H6dqZX

medical,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain-Barré syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity. METHODS: We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed versus predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity. RESULTS: In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥ 0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% vs. 21%, Europe/North America 9% vs. 21% and Asia 17% vs. 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions. INTERPRETATION: This prospective, international, cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain-Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome patients.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The current pandemic has affected people’s health multidimensionally. This study aims to investigate musculoskeletal pain, sleep quality, depression levels, and their relationships in individuals belonging to different age groups during COVID-19 in Turkey. METHODS: A web-based self-administered survey that consisted of demographic questions, The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and scores of musculoskeletal pain was sent to participants. Pearson correlation analysis was used for determining the statistical relationship between variables. RESULTS: The study includes 1,778 participants. The highest percentage for mild, moderate, and severe pain was in the head (49.8%), back (15.5%), and head (11.5%), respectively. The PSQI-total had shown a weak correlation with pain levels in all body parts. The highest correlation for sleep quality and pain levels was between the PSQI-5 and lower back pain. There was a weak correlation between PSQI-2 and the BDI score, and a moderate correlation between the PSQI-1, PSQI-5, PSQI-7, PSQI-total, and BDI score. Pain in all body parts showed a weak correlation with depression level. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that musculoskeletal pain was varied in body parts with different intensities according to age groups in Turkey during the pandemic. The most common pain was in the head, back, and lower back. Headache was found correlated with the parameters of sleep quality. Pain of the head, neck, back, lower back, and shoulder were correlated with sleep latency.

medical,"The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a huge impact on public mental health. This was also reflected in dreams. Not only did people start to remember more dreams, but dream content changed as themes like sickness, confinement, and—in the English-speaking world—even bugs began to dominate. This also led to an increase in nightmare frequency. There are various factors that contributed to this change in the dream landscape. Some people have started to sleep more and hereby spend more time in REM sleep, which is known to increase dream recall and further lead to bizarre and vivid dreams. On the other hand, stress and poor mental health had an impact on sleep, and sleep quality thus dropped in many individuals. Poor sleep quality can also lead to an increase in dream recall. Dreams are known to regulate mood, so the rise in dreams and the change in dream content could also reflect a reaction to the overall rise in stress and decline in mental health. Recent studies have shown that as the pandemic progresses, further changes in mental health, dream recall, and dream content arise, but data are still scarce. Further research could help understand the impact the pandemic still has on mental health and dreams, and how this impact is changing over the course of the pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",BuQhQW

I am not following any treatment since my parents are not supportive and they only scold me for doing repetitive tasks or taking too much time to do something which for them is something simple. The ocd was a new term for me and while reading on the internet I came to know that am suffering from it. As a child, I was suffering from this and used to get negative thoughts.Then, I used to cry whenever I felt irritated by the thoughts. I started to have phobias while being in buses or vehicles that move too quick. I behave foolishly and want the vehicle to stop. But what keeps me more worried is that I fear those negative thoughts might happen. I know OCD people have thoughts that are not real, but since I read the book the secret in which was stated that repetitive thoughts about something can make it real and can make it happen, I am much more worried. I think this book has made my OCD worst. I am always afraid that these thoughts that I do not want to happen may occur like said in the book. Today, there was a ritual for my grand parents who are no longer alive, and while performing those rituals i thought of someone whom i love the most. Now i fear that something bad happen to the person I love the most. I DO NOT WANT SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO HAPPEN TO THE ONE I LOVE THE MOST.

medical,"Polyanions are negatively charged macromolecules known for several decades as inhibitors of many viruses in vitro, notably AIDS virus. In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",2Sn10B

medical,"BACKGROUND In March 2014, the World Health Organization was notified of an outbreak of Zaire ebolavirus in a remote area of Guinea. The outbreak then spread to the capital, Conakry, and to neighboring countries and has subsequently become the largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to date. METHODS From March 25 to April 26, 2014, we performed a study of all patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Conakry. Mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, complications, treatments, and comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS Of 80 patients who presented with symptoms, 37 had laboratory-confirmed EVD. Among confirmed cases, the median age was 38 years (interquartile range, 28 to 46), 24 patients (65%) were men, and 14 (38%) were health care workers; among the health care workers, nosocomial transmission was implicated in 12 patients (32%). Patients with confirmed EVD presented to the hospital a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7) after the onset of symptoms, most commonly with fever (in 84% of the patients; mean temperature, 38.6°C), fatigue (in 65%), diarrhea (in 62%), and tachycardia (mean heart rate, >93 beats per minute). Of these patients, 28 (76%) were treated with intravenous fluids and 37 (100%) with antibiotics. Sixteen patients (43%) died, with a median time from symptom onset to death of 8 days (interquartile range, 7 to 11). Patients who were 40 years of age or older, as compared with those under the age of 40 years, had a relative risk of death of 3.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 8.59; P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS Patients with EVD presented with evidence of dehydration associated with vomiting and severe diarrhea. Despite attempts at volume repletion, antimicrobial therapy, and limited laboratory services, the rate of death was 43%.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",wtLLKy

medical,"BACKGROUND: The UK went into nationwide lockdown on 24 March 2020, in response to COVID-19. The direct psychiatric effects of this are relatively unknown. AIMS: We examined whether the first UK lockdown changed the demographics of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals (to include gender, legality, route of admission and diagnoses), independent of seasonal variation.. METHOD: We conducted an anonymous review of psychiatric admissions aged &gt;=18 years in the 6-month period after the announcement of the first UK lockdown (March to August 2020), and in the previous year (March to August 2019), in Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust in-patient facilities. The number of admissions were compared, along with factors that may help to explain the psychological effects of national lockdown. RESULTS: There was no significant increase in total number of admissions or the gender percentage. However, there was a 11.8% increase in formal sectioning under the Mental Health Act 1983. This increase was sustained and statistically significant across all 6 months. A sustained decrease in admissions via the crisis team was also observed as being statistically significant. Separate diagnoses saw changes in percentage of admissions between March and May. The most statistically significant was schizophrenia admissions for men in April (18.7%), and women in March (18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the effect of COVID-19 on the legal status of psychiatric admissions, and emphasise the importance of having a robust, adaptable and open psychiatric service that caters to the ongoing needs of patients, regardless of government restrictions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0s26N3

medical,"Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are generally triggered by stress-induced translation arrest for storing mRNAs. Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA virus, coronavirus, mutates frequently and circulates among animals, imposing great threat to public safety and animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infections is largely unknown. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provide evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We show that the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 is responsible for the inhibition of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A triggered transcription of IFN-β which in turn greatly affected recombinant virus replication. Further analysis showed that SGs function as antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. Additional evidence includes the aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease nsp15 of IBV suppresses the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually ensuring productive virus replication. We speculate that coronaviruses employ similar mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation for efficient virus replication, as the endoribonuclease function of nsp15 is conserved in all coronaviruses. Author summary It has been reported that stress granules (SGs) are part of the host cell antiviral response. Not surprisingly, viruses in turn produce an array of antagonists to counteract such host response. Here, we show that IBV inhibits the formation of SGs through its endoribonuclease nsp15, by reducing the accumulation of viral dsRNA, evading the activation of PKR, and by subsequently inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation and SGs formation. Nsp15 also inhibits SG formation independent of the eIF2α pathway, probably by targeting host mRNA. Depletion of SG scaffold proteins decreases IRF3-IFN response and increases the production of IBV. All coronaviruses encode a conserved endoribonuclease nsp15, and it will be important to determine whether also other (non-avian) coronaviruses limit the formation of anti-viral SGs in a similar manner.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ms0rbH

medical,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study we report the outcome of salvage mastectomy and reconstruction in 11 BRCA mutation carrier patients that participated in a clinical trial of prophylactic contralateral breast irradiation and suffered reoccurrences of breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or elected to have the procedure for risk reduction. Patients’ satisfaction and physicians’ assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. These results are encouraging and support continuing research as well as a discussion of risk-reduction alternatives besides mastectomy, including prophylactic breast irradiation, in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. ABSTRACT: Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) is often advocated for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who face a heightened lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, many carrier patients seek alternative risk-reducing measures. In a phase II nonrandomized trial, we previously reported that prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast among BRCA carriers undergoing breast-conserving treatment significantly reduced subsequent contralateral breast cancer. Herein, we report the outcome of salvage mastectomy and reconstruction in 11 patients that suffered reoccurrences of breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or elected to have the procedure for risk reduction during the eight-year follow-up period. Patients’ satisfaction with the procedure and physicians’ assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. Although the numbers are small, the results are encouraging and sustain hope in a challenging population. Our findings support continuing research as well as a discussion of risk-reduction alternatives besides mastectomy, including prophylactic breast irradiation, in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",UGsDh1

medical,"Food insecurity affects 1 in 8 American adults annually, and is more prevalent in Black and sexual minority women. We applied an intersectional approach to investigate food insecurity prevalence in women with intersecting minority race and sexual orientation. We used two United States surveillance systems—National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2013-2018 and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2014, to estimate how race and sexual orientation jointly influence food insecurity prevalence in women aged 18-59 years (NHIS: N = 47593; NHANES: N = 4676). All analyses were stratified for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use. Relative measures estimated weighted prevalence ratios (PR) comparing Black and White sexual minority women (SMW) to heterosexual White women. Absolute prevalence measures estimated the excess prevalence of food insecurity due to multiple marginalization. Patterns of food insecurity prevalence were similar across NHIS and NHANES, and differed only for non-SNAP users. Relative prevalence of food insecurity was greater in Black SMW than heterosexual White women in NHIS (PR: 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-3.30) and NHANES (PR: 2.79; 95% CI, 1.73- 4.51). The strength of the association between multiple marginalization and food insecurity was stronger for Black SMW than White SMW. Absolute measures were significant only for NHIS and did not support our a priori hypothesis: For non-SNAP users being Black and sexual minority reduced the joint disparity in food insecurity by 50% (Synergy Index: 0.50; 95% CI, 0.11- 0.93). Overall, our study illuminated population-level differences in food insecurity among women of diverse minority races and sexual orientations. Black SMW experience high rates of food insecurity, which may contribute to chronic disease disparities. Yet, intersecting minority social positions (race and sexual orientation) reduced food insecurity; these findings are unexpected and must be further investigated. Increasing SNAP use among multiply marginalized women may attenuate food insecurity disparities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cnQgjl

medical,"This study is aimed at discussing the value of ultrasonic image features in diagnosis of perinatal outcomes of severe preeclampsia on account of deep learning algorithm. 140 pregnant women singleton with severe preeclampsia were selected as the observation group. At the same time, 140 normal singleton pregnant women were selected as the control group. The hemodynamic indexes were detected by color Doppler ultrasound. The CNN algorithm was used to classify ultrasound images of two groups of pregnant women. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mean pixel accuracy (MPA), and mean intersection of union (MIOU) values of CNN algorithm were 0.9410, 0.9228, and 0.8968, respectively. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 93.44%, 95.13%, 95.09%, and 94.87%, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal control group, the umbilical artery (UA), uterine artery-systolic/diastolic (UTA-S/D), uterine artery (UTA), and digital video (DV) of pregnant women in the observation group were remarkably increased; the minimum alveolar effective concentration (MCA) of the observation group was obviously lower than the MCA of the control group, and the differences between groups were statistically valid (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that UA-S/D, UA-resistance index (UA-RI), UTA-S/D, UTA-pulsatility index (UTA-PI), DV-peak velocity index for veins (DV-PVIV), and MCA-S/D were independent risk factors for the outcome of perinatal children with severe preeclampsia.

medical,"Abstract Influenza A viruses isolated from the cloaca of naturally infected feral ducks replicate in the lungs and in the cells lining the intestinal tract of feral and domestic ducks. Despite the low pH of the gizzard, the duck influenza viruses reach the intestines via the digestive tract and are found in high concentration in the feces. The viruses retain infectivity in fecal material for at least 30 days at 4° and for 7 days at 20°. The morphology of one strain of intestinal duck influenza virus (Hav7 Neg2) that had never been passed in embryonated eggs and was isolated from the feces was roughly spherical and fairly uniform in size and shape. However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0° and for 4 days at 22°. The susceptibility of ducks to infection with human and avian strains of influenza virus and the possibility of transmission to animal species through the water supply suggests that ducks may be important in the ecology of influenza viruses. The possibility of “intestinal influenza” virus vaccines is considered.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DlqEd7

medical,"Telemedicine (TM) enabled by digital health technologies to provide medical services has been considered a key solution to increasing health care access in rural communities. With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DYlrx_

However, few cases of AAV have been identified so far in COVID-19 patients. To define the frequency of ANCA autoimmunity in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the serum ANCAs and the serum PR3 and MPO antigens by immunoassays in 124 adult patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (16 were asymptomatic and 108 were hospitalized) and 48 control subjects. The serum ANCAs were significantly higher in the hospitalized patients compared with either the controls or the asymptomatic patients and increased with the progression of the COVID-19 severity. After one week of hospitalization, the values were significantly lower. In contrast, no differences emerged among the controls, asymptomatic and hospitalized patients for the PR3 and MPO serum levels. None of the patients had clinical signs of AAV with the exception of a severe pulmonary involvement. Further studies are necessary to define whether the increase in the serum ANCAs might mask subclinical vasculitis in a percentage of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or it is an epiphenomenon of SARS-CoV-2 infection with no clinical manifestations.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",hI7zUt

medical,"Information and communication technology and the internet created unprecedented opportunities for collecting “big data” and apply it to surveillance and influence the behaviour of citizens, for instance in their roles of voters, customers, partners and workers. There is a growing risk that data on these different roles is exchanged and combined for which it was not collected. Surveillance may be defended from the perspective of law and order, protection of safety and health, and economic development, but it may also impact negatively on several United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be attained by 2030. Being one of the crucial issues in the world today, it comes as no surprise that the topic is being studied by lawyers, urbanists, sociologists, computer scientists, political scientists and others. However, criminologists have until now mainly looked at surveillance in the context of preventing and detecting crime and terrorism from a “what happens and what works” angle.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed severe stress on healthcare systems worldwide, which is amplified by the critical shortage of COVID-19 tests. METHODS: In this study, we propose to generate a more accurate diagnosis model of COVID-19 based on patient symptoms and routine test results by applying machine learning to reanalyzing COVID-19 data from 151 published studies. We aim to investigate correlations between clinical variables, cluster COVID-19 patients into subtypes, and generate a computational classification model for discriminating between COVID-19 patients and influenza patients based on clinical variables alone. RESULTS: We discovered several novel associations between clinical variables, including correlations between being male and having higher levels of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils. We found that COVID-19 patients could be clustered into subtypes based on serum levels of immune cells, gender, and reported symptoms. Finally, we trained an XGBoost model to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 97.9% in discriminating COVID-19 patients from influenza patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that computational methods trained on large clinical datasets could yield ever more accurate COVID-19 diagnostic models to mitigate the impact of lack of testing.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Assembly has adopted a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer. However, neither the optimal pathway nor the corresponding economic and health benefits have been evaluated. We take China as an example to assess the optimal pathway towards elimination and the cost-effectiveness of tailored actions. METHODS: A validated hybrid model was used to assess the costs and benefits of alternative strategies combining human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical screening, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer for females with different immunization history. All Chinese females living or projected to be born during 2015–2100, under projected trends in aging, urbanization, and sexual activity, were considered. Optimal strategies were determined by cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers. Primary outcomes were cervical cancer cases and deaths averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We employed a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: The optimal pathway represents an integration of multiple tailored strategies from females with different immunization history. If China adopts the optimal pathway, the age-standardized incidence of cervical cancer is predicted to decrease to fewer than four new cases per 100,000 women (i.e., elimination) by 2047 (95% confidence interval 2043 to 2050). Compared to the status quo, the optimal pathway would avert a total of 7,509,192 (6,922,744 to 8,359,074) cervical cancer cases and 2,529,873 (2,366,826 to 2,802,604) cervical cancer deaths in 2021–2100, with the discounted ICER being $− 339 (− 687 to − 79) per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: By adopting an optimal pathway from 2021 (namely, the year of the first Chinese Centennial Goals) onwards, cervical cancer could be eliminated by the late 2040s (namely, ahead of the second Chinese Centennial Goals) while saving net economic costs in China.

medical,"High concentrations of Cr(VI) are often detected in contaminated soil. Yet, cost-effective remediation technologies have been lacking. In this study, we prepared a type of FeSx based on commercial FeSO4.7H2O and CaSx and tested a microwave-assisted technology based on FeSx for reductive immobilization of high concentrations of Cr(VI) in a field contaminated soil. The as-prepared FeSx particles appeared as a honeycomb-like and highly porous structure. The microwave-assisted FeSx reduction process was able to rapidly reduce the TCLP-based reachability of Cr(VI) from 391.8 to 2.6 mg·L-1. The dosage of FeSx, S/Fe molar ratio, initial moisture content, microwave power, and irradiation time can all affect the treatment effectiveness. After 500 days curing under atmospheric conditions, the TCLP-leached concentration of Cr remained below the regulatory limit of 5 mg·L-1, while other treatments failed to meet the goal. Sx2- or S2- served as the primary electron donors, whereas Fe facilitated the microwave absorption and the formation of the stable final product of FeCr2O4. S and Fe are mostly precipitated in soil.

medical,"Medical image processing is one of the most important topics in the field of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical image tasks. However, conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue (Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\% classification accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than ""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8\% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Cy4rwT

This review is focusing on anti-biofouling polymers with special surface wettability, and it will provide a new perspective to promote the development of anti-biofouling polymers for biomedical applications. Firstly, current anti-biofouling strategies are discussed followed by a comprehensive review of anti-biofouling polymers with specific types of surface wettability, including superhydrophilicity, hydrophilicity, and hydrophobicity. We then summarize the applications of anti-biofouling polymers with specific surface wettability in typical biomedical fields both in vivo and in vitro, such as cardiology, ophthalmology, and nephrology. Finally, the challenges and directions of the development of anti-biofouling polymers with special surface wettability are discussed.

medical,"Persistent impairment in cognitive functioning postoperatively is reported by clinical and animal studies, and is labeled as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Evidence points to an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response resulting from peripheral systemic inflammation after surgery, with subsequent cytokine-induced glutamatergic excitotoxicity and synaptic impairment. These immunological changes, among many others, are also observed in Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist commonly used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Surprisingly, little research exists on the role of memantine in preventing POCD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of memantine on a spectrum of cognitive functions postoperatively. Mice were divided into 3 groups and each received treatment for 4 weeks. Placebo groups received a placebo then underwent either a sham procedure or a laparotomy procedure. The memantine group received memantine hydrochloride then underwent a laparotomy procedure. Cognitive tests were performed on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 7. Compared to sham-operated mice, placebo groups that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed impaired memory in the Morris water maze test, higher anxiety-like behavior in the open field and the elevated plus maze tests, increased depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test, and lack of preference for social novelty in the three-chamber test. On the other hand, memantine-treated mice that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed enhanced memory on POD7, improved depression-like behavior on POD1 and POD7, enhanced preference for social novelty on POD1, and no improvement in anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest a potential protective effect of memantine in mice postoperatively on memory, depression-like behavior, and preference for social novelty.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",99Tl_0

medical,"AIM Pharmacovigilance data are primarily used to identify adverse drug reactions by screening for disproportionate reporting, i.e. more reports of certain combinations of adverse events and drugs than expected. However, scanning for associations of drugs and adverse events that occur less frequently than expected provides hypotheses for drug repurposing, i.e. a known drug could be therapeutically beneficial for a new indication like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As coronavirus related adverse events are scarce in pharmacovigilance data prior to 2020, we searched for drugs suitable against similar viral diseases. METHODS In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance study, drugs associated with viral respiratory tract infections and/or diseases caused by RNA-viruses, which are phylogenetically similar to SARS-CoV-2, were extracted from the U.S. FAERS pharmacovigilance data 2004Q1 to 2020Q2 using OpenVigil 2.1-MedDRA17, filtered for significant inverse associations (ROR<1 and padj <0.05), checked for implausibility (e.g., only topically) or clinical infeasibility (e.g., strong cytotoxic effects), and categorised by their WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code. RESULTS A total of 126 drugs were identified. ATC clustering of the manually curated list of 112 candidate drugs revealed female sex hormones, anti-diabetics, neuropharmacological sigma-receptor modulators, peptidase inhibitors, antiviral drugs, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors as putatively antiviral. CONCLUSION Scanning for inverse signals in pharmacovigilance data provides new hypotheses for drug repurposing, theoretically for all indications. Concerning the treatment of viral respiratory infections, there is affirmative data for some candidate drugs; the remaining proposed candidate drugs without already known antiviral mechanism of action should stimulate further exploration.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",5ZRMbr

medical,"Winnicott's clinical-theoretical matrix constitutes a distinction in underlying basic principles from both the Freudian and Kleinian models. In essence, Winnicott's concept of trauma is entirely related to the vicissitudes of the early psychic parent-infant relationship in which the mother's role is fundamental for the development of the newborn's psyche at the beginning and subsequently. While Winnicott acknowledges the difference between physical and psychic trauma, his focus is on how the interpsychic relationship, psyche to nascent psyche, contributes to the infant's intrapsychic world. Thus, early trauma is caused by psychic transmissions that emanate through and because of the mother's affective states of mind towards her fetus-becoming-an-infant and her infant-becoming-a-child. The earlier that psychic trauma occurs in the nascent psyche, the more severe the outcome of the individual's mental health. This is why Winnicott refers to psychosis as an environmental deficiency disease as distinct from psychotic defences. The author outlines Winnicott's key concepts that are intrinsic to his theory of trauma i.e. the antisocial tendency, fear of breakdown and regression. These concepts are woven into the fabric of Winnicott's theoretical matrix and highlight his perspective on psychoanalysis as a therapeutic treatment for all levels of psychic trauma.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-YKkcE

medical,"BACKGROUND: The United States (US) healthcare system has experienced enormous economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by both loss of revenue related to shutdowns and increased strain on resources. These factors have impacted the workload and finances of physicians. METHODS: A 31-item anonymous survey evaluating the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians was developed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham using Qualtrics(XM) software and included questions on adverse economic impact (defined as selecting job loss, furlough or reduced income as a stressor), workload, and compensation. It was distributed via physician professional and social networks including email, Facebook groups, and #MedicalTwitter May 14-July 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 597 respondents, 295 (49%) reported adverse economic impact, with the highest proportions among emergency medicine (71%), anesthesiologists (63%), and surgeons (60%) and lowest among infectious diseases (ID) (25%). In multivariable analysis (Table), physicians practicing in the Northeastern US saw the lowest economic impact versus the South (OR 3.44, 95% CI: 2.03–5.84), Midwest (2.62, 1.36–5.05) or West (1.98, 1.06–3.71). Physicians practicing in federal or academic settings experienced less economic impact than those in community settings (0.09, 0.03–0.30 and 0.61, 0.41–0.93 respectively). Increased work hours were identified by 185 (31%) of respondents as a stressor, with 169 (92%) reporting additional hours were partially or completely uncompensated. Among 584 respondents, 212 (36%) had new roles and responsibilities (Figure), with the highest proportion among ID physicians (75%).

Much of this additional work is uncompensated due to the economic impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system. Simultaneously, many physicians across the US have suffered adverse economic consequences, especially in the South. ID physicians have experienced higher workload but less economic impact, related to increased need for their expertise and new roles and responsibilities.

medical,"The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has affected millions of people worldwide. To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID‐19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co‐infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co‐infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS‐CoV‐2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS‐CoV‐2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co‐infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co‐infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID‐19. Also, the antibiotic‐resistant as a result of overusing must be considered. In this review, we will summarize the bacterial co‐infection and secondary bacterial infection in some featured respiratory viral infections, especially COVID‐19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",TIA8xc
medical,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary ancient innate immune response in plants, nematodes, and arthropods providing natural protection against viral infection. Viruses have also gained counter‐defensive measures by producing virulence determinants called viral‐suppressors‐of‐RNAi (VSRs). Interestingly, in spite of dominance of interferon‐based immunity over RNAi in somatic cells of higher vertebrates, recent reports are accumulating in favour of retention of the antiviral nature of RNAi in mammalian cells. The present study focuses on the modulation of intracellular RNAi during infection with rotavirus (RV), an enteric virus with double‐stranded RNA genome. Intriguingly, a time point‐dependent bimodal regulation of RNAi was observed in RV‐infected cells, where short interfering RNA (siRNA)‐based RNAi was rendered non‐functional during early hours of infection only to be reinstated fully beyond that early infection stage. Subsequent investigations revealed RV nonstructural protein 1 to serve as a putative VSR by associating with and triggering degradation of Argonaute2 (AGO2), the prime effector of siRNA‐mediated RNAi, via ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. The proviral significance of AGO2 degradation was further confirmed when ectopic overexpression of AGO2 significantly reduced RV infection. Cumulatively, the current study presents a unique modulation of host RNAi during RV infection, highlighting the importance of antiviral RNAi in mammalian cells.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",o-mPAR
medical,"Recent outbreak of 2019 novel Corona virus poses serious challenge for the global health system. In lieu of paucity of experimental data, tools and the very basic understanding of host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, well thought effective measures are needed to control COVID-19 pandemic. We have identified specific overlapping antigenic peptide epitopes (OAPE) within the 4 structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 predictive of triggering robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in host using bio-informatics tools (NetMHC4.0, IEDB, and Vaxijen2.0). We speculate an early release of pro-inflammatory cytokines for protection and later release of anti-inflammatory cytokines for prevention of immunopathology in designing a vaccine for Covid-19. Therefore, the selected immunogenic OAPE were subjected to in silico tools (IL-6-Pred, IFNepitope and PIP-EL) for analyzing their pro-inflammatory response. The OAPEs found to be pro-inflammatory in nature were further subjected to prediction servers (IL-4-Pred, IL-10-Pred, Pre-AIP) to characterize them as inducers of anti-inflammatory response as well. We finally filtered out 12 OAPE which had affinity for both CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as were inducers of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. On confirmation of OAPE binding affinity for respective T cell specific MHC allele using docking studies (pepATTRACT, Hex8.0 and Discovery studio) they were found to be have more immunogenic potential than the 3 negative control peptides (NCPs) included in the study. Additionally, we constructed CTxB-adjuvanated multi-epitopic vaccine inclusive of the 12 OAPEs which was non-toxic, non-allergenic and capable of inducing both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A successful in silico cloning and docking of modeled subunit vaccine construct with toll like receptor-2 (TLR-2) confirmed the high efficacy of our multi-epitopic vaccine which can through a balanced interplay of cytokines help in creating a steady-state immune equilibrium. In silico immune simulation studies with the vaccine using C-ImmSim server also showed higher percentage of T cells along with production of pro-inflammatory as well as some anti-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental validation of this prediction based study on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of un-infected individuals, patients and recovered individuals will facilitate production of high priority effective SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidate.

medical,"IntroductionThis study aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the number of people seen at public facilities in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sierra Leone for essential primary healthcare services. MethodsThe number of weekly consultations for antenatal care (ANC), outpatient (OPD), expanded programme on immunisations (EPI), family planning (FP) services and HIV, for the period of January 2018-December 2020, were collected from 25 primary healthcare facilities in Masaka district, Uganda, 21 health centres in Goma, DRC, and 29 facilities in Kambia district, Sierra Leone. Negative binomial regression models accounting for facility level clustering and season were used to analyse changes in activity levels between 2018, 2019 and 2020. ResultsWe found no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of OPD, EPI or ANC consultations in Goma. Family planning consultations were 17% lower in March-July 2020 compared to 2019, but this recovered by December 2020. New diagnoses of HIV were 34% lower throughout 2020 compared to 2019. Compared to the same periods in 2019, facilities in Sierra Leone had 18-29% fewer OPD consultations throughout 2020, and 27% fewer DTP3 doses in March-July 2020, but this had recovered by Jul-Dec. There was no evidence of differences in other services. In Uganda there were 20-35% fewer under-5 OPD consultations, 21-66% fewer MCV1 doses, and 48-51% fewer new diagnoses of HIV, throughout 2020, compared to 2019. There was no difference in the number of HPV doses delivered in 2020 compared to 2019. ConclusionsThe level of disruption appeared to correlate with the strength of lockdown measures in the different settings and community attitudes towards the risk posed by COVID-19. Mitigation strategies such as health communications campaigns and outreach services proved important to limit the impact of lockdowns on primary healthcare services. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic and the response measures put in place caused disruption to the provision and utilisation of primary healthcare services worldwide. What this study addsWe document that the COVID-19 pandemic had a varied impact on different services in three distinct settings on the African continent. The extent that the pandemic impacted services correlated with the stringency of the lockdowns, community perceptions of the level of danger posed by the pandemic and communities prior exposure to Ebola epidemics and concomitant response measures. How this study might affect research, practice, or policystrategies such as communication campaigns and outreach services limited the impact of lockdowns on essential services and would be valuable strategies to implement in future epidemics.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",4xrMk8

It is now time to intervene, he states he just felt better, that the diapers eased his anxiety and make him feel as if everything that was bothering him would somehow quickly just disappear..He witnessed his little girlfriend at age 4 in the daycare that she had wet herself during nap time and the daycare worker ut her in a diaper instead o putting on a clean change of clothing that brought every day in her back pack, as if the daycare was punishing her for wetting herself...my son is just now starting to open up to me regarding this, he claims it is a fetish to a degree because he looked the word up in the dictionary..He has recently been through some stressful situations an has thought about putting a diaper on but hesitated.

medical,"Q:A 50-year-old woman presents with an acute worsening of a chronic rash on her arms and hands for the past week. She says she first noticed the rash 1 year ago which started as little red spots and gradually increased in size. 7 days ago, she noticed the rash suddenly got much worse and spread to her inguinal area, scalp, and knees, which has steadily worsened. She describes the rash as itchy but generally not painful. She says she feels it is very noticeable now and is causing her significant anxiety and depression in addition to the discomfort. The patient denies any fever, chills, sick contacts, or recent travel, and has no significant past medical history. She denies any alcohol use, smoking history, or recreational drug use. Her family history is significant for Crohn disease in her mother and maternal grandmother. She mentions that she has been excessively stressed the past few weeks as she is starting a new job. Review of systems is significant for early morning swelling of the distal joints in her hands and feet for the past 3 months. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, there are multiple silvery scaly plaques on the extensor surfaces of her upper extremities bilaterally as shown in the exhibit (see image).

This paper proposes a mobile Virtual Reality (VR) application for teaching physics education to high school learners in a virtual laboratory. It was developed using Unity3D game engine, Visual Studio Community, Photoshop and 3D Studio Max. It was deployed on Android-based smartphones. The user comfort levels and VR content were tested. The results showed that about 50% of learners felt uncomfortable when using VR equipment. However, none reported any form of unease such as dizziness while being immersed in the virtual environment. Secondly, about 45% of learners mentioned that VR content was adequately presented. Furthermore, 65% of the users clearly understood the voice commands, and 35% needed to hear the commands repeatedly for them to be able to operate the application. The application offers an interactive and immersive 3D environment to learn the fundamentals of Ohm's Law. The application has the potential to address learning barriers experienced by learners who lack laboratory equipment but are expected to conduct scientific experiments. A learner with a smartphone and a head-mounted display will be able to make use of the proposed application in the comfort of their own home. © 2021 IEEE.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sUv7jo

Our objective was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on somatic symptoms among Chinese college and primary school students, to provide reference data pertaining to the mental health of this population in the context of a public health emergency. In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

METHODS A comprehensive literature review on COVID-19 was conducted. A two-stage modified Delphi technique involving 18 oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons across Canada was used to determine consensus risk-stratification criteria and PPE recommendations for surgeries performed in the North American context. RESULTS COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We summarize COVID-19 virology and transmission, as well as practice considerations for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted predominantly by droplet mechanisms, some studies suggest that transmission is possible through aerosols. Among common procedures performed by oculofacial and plastic surgeons, some are likely to be considered aerosol-generating. Risk of transmission increases when manipulating structures known to harbor high viral loads. We present an algorithm for risk-stratification based on the nature of surgery and the anatomical sites involved and offer recommendations for PPE. CONCLUSIONS Although universal droplet precautions are now recommended in most healthcare settings, some clinical situations require more stringent infection control measures. By highlighting high-risk scenarios specific to oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery, as well as PPE recommendations, we hope to enhance the safety of continued care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",n-vpUQ

medical,"Background:Global knowledge of treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 has been evolving since the onset of the pandemic. Materials and Methods:The objective of this cross-sectional study was to explore treatment and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted in a Combined Military Hospital of Bangladesh. Data were collected from treatment records of patients of the CMH Bogura during the period of June 2020 to August 2020. Total 219 RT-PCR positive admitted patients were included as study population. Result: Among 219 patients, 78.6% were male and 21.5% were female, mean age of patients was 34.3 ( 12.2). About 14.6% patients had one or more comorbidities. Most (83.1%) of the admitted patients were diagnosed as mild cases. Antimicrobials were used in 98.8% cases, and frequent use of doxycycline (80.4%) and ivermectine (77.2%) was found. Anticoagulant and steroid therapy were used in 42.0% and 15.5% patients respectively. O2 therapy was required in 6.0% cases and intensive care unit (ICU) support was needed in 2.3% cases.Duration of hospital stay was 12.1 (4.4) days and 100% of patients were discharged from hospital. There was no single mortality during the study period. Conclusion:High prevalence of antimicrobials use was observed among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients in this single center study.Supportive care was effective with no incidence of mortality.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oY7o6z
medical,"The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) provide strong protection against severe COVID-19, including hospitalization, for at least several months after receipt of the second dose (1,2). However, studies examining immune responses and differences in protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization in real-world settings, including by vaccine product, are limited. To understand how vaccine effectiveness (VE) might change with time, CDC and collaborators assessed the comparative effectiveness of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalization at two periods (14-119 days and ≥120 days) after receipt of the second vaccine dose among 1,896 U.S. veterans at five Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs) during February 1-September 30, 2021. Among 234 U.S. veterans fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and without evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 were also compared. Adjusted VE 14-119 days following second Moderna vaccine dose was 89.6% (95% CI = 80.1%-94.5%) and after the second Pfizer-BioNTech dose was 86.0% (95% CI = 77.6%-91.3%); at ≥120 days VE was 86.1% (95% CI = 77.7%-91.3%) for Moderna and 75.1% (95% CI = 64.6%-82.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech. Antibody levels were significantly higher among Moderna recipients than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients across all age groups and periods since vaccination; however, antibody levels among recipients of both products declined between 14-119 days and ≥120 days. These findings from a cohort of older, hospitalized veterans with high prevalences of underlying conditions suggest the importance of booster doses to help maintain long-term protection against severe COVID-19..",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",C4WX9y

When combined with next-generation sequencing of immune repertoires, we were able to specifically identify clonal family members, synthesize the monoclonal antibodies, and confirm that they interact with the antigen in a manner equivalent to the corresponding polyclonal antibodies.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to surgical practice across the worlds. Some countries are seeing a tailing down of cases, while others are still having persistent and sustained community spread. These evolving disease patterns call for a customized and dynamic approach to the selection, screening, planning, and for the conduct of surgery for these patients. METHODS: The current literature and various international society guidelines were reviewed and a set of recommendations were drafted. These were circulated to the Governors of the Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of Asia (ELSA) for expert comments and discussion. The results of these were compiled and are presented in this paper. RESULTS: The recommendations include guidance for selection and screening of patients in times of active community spread, limited community spread, during times of sporadic cases or recovery and the transition between phases. Personal protective equipment requirements are also reviewed for each phase as minimum requirements. Capability management for the re-opening of services is also discussed. The choice between open and laparoscopic surgery is patient based, and the relative advantages of laparoscopic surgery with regard to complications, and respiratory recovery after major surgery has to be weighed against the lack of safety data for laparoscopic surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. We provide recommendations on the operating room set up and conduct of general surgery. If laparoscopic surgery is to be performed, we describe circuit modifications to assist in reducing plume generation and aerosolization. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires every surgical unit to have clear guidelines to ensure both patient and staff safety. These guidelines may assist in providing guidance to units developing their own protocols. A judicious approach must be adopted as surgical units look to re-open services as the pandemic evolves.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",JxZEnp

medical,"Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, building an automated framework that quantifies the severity of COVID-19 and localizes the relevant lesion on chest X-ray images has become increasingly important. Although pixel-level lesion severity labels, e.g. lesion segmentation, can be the most excellent target to build a robust model, collecting enough data with such labels is difficult due to time and labor-intensive annotation tasks. Instead, array-based severity labeling that assigns integer scores on six subdivisions of lungs can be an alternative choice enabling the quick labeling. Several groups proposed deep learning algorithms that quantify the severity of COVID-19 using the array-based COVID-19 labels and localize the lesions with explainability maps. To further improve the accuracy and interpretability, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer tailored for both quantification of the severity and clinically applicable localization of the COVID-19 related lesions. Our model is trained in a weakly-supervised manner to generate the full probability maps from weak array-based labels. Furthermore, a novel progressive self-training method enables us to build a model with a small labeled dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis on the external testset demonstrates that our method shows comparable performance with radiologists for both tasks with stability in a real-world application.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Bby-pK

Consequently, the present study was designed to assess the intertwining impact of coadministration of cefepime (CP, a wide spectrum antibiotic) and diclofenac sodium (DF, an NSAID) on rat's liver, kidney, and testes. Rats received saline, CP (180 mg/kg/day, IM), DF (10 mg/kg/day, IM), or a combination of CP and DF. After 14 days, CP or DF induced tissue damage expressed by marked biochemical alterations in hepatic and renal function tests. Besides this, disrupted lipid metabolism and testosterone levels along with significant histological changes in hepatic, renal, and testicular tissues were noticed. A significant increase in malondialdehyde and decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities alongside significant upregulated caspase 3 expression in tissues following CP or DF treatment suggested a bearable influence of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Accordingly, the simultaneous therapy of CP and DF evoked more obvious tissue damage than their individual treatment. Overall, data concluded that concurrent use of CP and DF in medical practice is a worrisome matter, so it should be done cautiously to avoid synergistic deleterious outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rZmXR4

medical," Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Overview Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior - the vicious cycle of OCD. OCD often centers around certain themes - for example, a fear of getting contaminated by germs. To ease your contamination fears, you may compulsively wash your hands until they're sore and chapped. If you have OCD, you may be ashamed and embarrassed about the condition, but treatment can be effective. Symptoms Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social or work functioning. OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: - Fear of contamination or dirt - Needing things orderly and symmetrical - Aggressive or horrific thoughts about harming yourself or others - Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: - Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched - Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove - Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way - Images of hurting yourself or someone else that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands - Distress about unpleasant sexual images repeating in your mind OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to prevent or reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: - Washing and cleaning - Checking - Counting - Orderliness - Following a strict routine - Demanding reassurances Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: - Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw - Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked - Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off - Counting in certain patterns - Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase - Arranging your canned goods to face the same way OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. There's a difference between being a perfectionist - someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example - and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way. If your obsessions and compulsions are affecting your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional. Causes The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder isn't fully understood. Main theories include: - Biology. OCD may be a result of changes in your body's own natural chemistry or brain functions. - Genetics. OCD may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be identified. - Environment. Some environmental factors such as infections are suggested as a trigger for OCD, but more research is needed. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing or triggering obsessive-compulsive disorder include: - Family history. Having parents or other family members with the disorder can increase your risk of developing OCD. - Stressful life events. If you've experienced traumatic or stressful events, your risk may increase. This reaction may, for some reason, trigger the intrusive thoughts, rituals and emotional distress characteristic of OCD. - Other mental health disorders. OCD may be related to other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse or tic disorders. Complications Problems resulting from OCD may include, among others: - Health issues, such as contact dermatitis from frequent hand-washing - Inability to attend work, school or social activities - Troubled relationships - Overall poor quality of life - Suicidal thoughts and behavior Diagnosis Steps to help diagnose OCD may include: - Physical exam. This may be done to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms and to check for any related complications. - Lab tests. These may include, for example, a complete blood count (CBC), a check of your thyroid function, and screening for alcohol and drugs. - Psychological evaluation. This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms and behavior patterns. With your permission, this may include talking to your family or friends. - Diagnostic criteria for OCD. Your doctor may use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic challenges It's sometimes difficult to diagnose OCD because symptoms can be similar to those of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia or other mental health disorders. And it's possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder. Work with your doctor so that you can get the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Treatment Obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment may not result in a cure, but it can help bring symptoms under control so that they don't rule your daily life. Some people need treatment for the rest of their lives. The two main treatments for OCD are psychotherapy and medications. Often, treatment is most effective with a combination of these. Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy, is effective for many people with OCD. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a type of CBT therapy, involves gradually exposing you to a feared object or obsession, such as dirt, and having you learn healthy ways to cope with your anxiety. ERP takes effort and practice, but you may enjoy a better quality of life once you learn to manage your obsessions and compulsions. Therapy may take place in individual, family or group sessions. Medications Certain psychiatric medications can help control the obsessions and compulsions of OCD. Most commonly, antidepressants are tried first. Antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat OCD include: - Clomipramine (Anafranil) for adults and children 10 years and older - Fluoxetine (Prozac) for adults and children 7 years and older - Fluvoxamine for adults and children 8 years and older - Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) for adults only - Sertraline (Zoloft) for adults and children 6 years and older However, your doctor may prescribe other antidepressants and psychiatric medications. Medications: What to consider Here are some issues to discuss with your doctor about medications for OCD: - Choosing a medication. In general, the goal is to effectively control symptoms at the lowest possible dosage. It's not unusual to try several drugs before finding one that works well. Your doctor might recommend more than one medication to effectively manage your symptoms. It can take weeks to months after starting a medication to notice an improvement in symptoms. - Side effects. All psychiatric medications have potential side effects. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects and about any health monitoring needed while taking psychiatric drugs. And let your doctor know if you experience troubling side effects. - Suicide risk. Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. If suicidal thoughts occur, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help. Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood. - Interactions with other substances. When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbs or other supplements you take. Some antidepressants can cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medications or herbal supplements. - Stopping antidepressants. Antidepressants aren't considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur. So stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Don't stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor, even if you're feeling better - you may have a relapse of OCD symptoms. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific medications. Other treatment Sometimes, medications and psychotherapy aren't effective enough to control OCD symptoms. Research continues on the potential effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating OCD that doesn't respond to traditional treatment approaches. Because DBS hasn't been thoroughly tested for use in treating OCD, make sure you understand all the pros and cons and possible health risks. Lifestyle and home remedies Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition, which means it may always be part of your life. While OCD warrants treatment by a professional, you can do some things for yourself to build on your treatment plan: - Take your medications as directed. Even if you're feeling well, resist any temptation to skip your medications. If you stop, OCD symptoms are likely to return. - Pay attention to warning signs. You and your doctor may have identified issues that can trigger your OCD symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. - Check first before taking other medications. Contact the doctor who's treating you for OCD before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, herbal remedies or other supplements to avoid possible interactions. - Practice what you learn. Work with your mental health professional to identify techniques and skills that help manage symptoms, and practice these regularly.

medical,"There is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we rationally designed and developed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS-CoV-2. Each oligonucleotide comprises a 3’ antisense sequence for target recognition and a 5’-phosphorylated 2’-5’ poly(A)4 for guided ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral response, the improved degradation efficiency of chimeric oligonucleotides was twice as much as classic antisense oligonucleotides in Vero cells, for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, one of chimeric oligonucleotides targeting spike RNA achieved potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and its recently reported N501Y and/or ΔH69/ΔV70 mutants. These results showed that the constructed chimeric oligonucleotides could efficiently degrade pathogenic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by immune activation, showing promising potentials as antiviral nucleic acid drugs for COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zSD2j9

medical,"MAIN CONCLUSION Australian native species of sorghum contain negligible amounts of dhurrin in their leaves and the cyanogenesis process is regulated differently under water-stress in comparison to domesticated sorghum species. Cyanogenesis in forage sorghum is a major concern in agriculture as the leaves of domesticated sorghum are potentially toxic to livestock, especially at times of drought which induces increased production of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. The wild sorghum species endemic to Australia have a negligible content of dhurrin in the above ground tissues and thus represent a potential resource for key agricultural traits like low toxicity. In this study we investigated the differential expression of cyanogenesis related genes in the leaf tissue of the domesticated species Sorghum bicolor and the Australian native wild species Sorghum macrospermum grown in glasshouse-controlled water-stress conditions using RNA-Seq analysis to analyse gene expression. The study identified genes, including those in the cyanogenesis pathway, that were differentially regulated in response to water-stress in domesticated and wild sorghum. In the domesticated sorghum, dhurrin content was significantly higher compared to that in the wild sorghum and increased with stress and decreased with age whereas in wild sorghum the dhurrin content remained negligible. The key genes in dhurrin biosynthesis, CYP79A1, CYP71E1 and UGT85B1, were shown to be highly expressed in S. bicolor. DHR and HNL encoding the dhurrinase and α-hydroxynitrilase catalysing bio-activation of dhurrin were also highly expressed in S. bicolor. Analysis of the differences in expression of cyanogenesis related genes between domesticated and wild sorghum species may allow the use of these genetic resources to produce more acyanogenic varieties in the future.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oJWKyq

medical,"As the world fights the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 17 million people globally were infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of 1 August 2020. Although infections are asymptomatic in 80% of cases, severe respiratory illness occurs in 20% of cases, requiring hospitalization and highly specialized intensive care. The WHO, under the International Health Regulations, declared this pandemic a public health emergency of international concern; it has affected nearly all health systems worldwide. The health system in Egypt, similar to many others, was severely challenged when confronted with the need for urgent and major expansion required to manage such a significant pandemic. This review uses publicly available data to provide an epidemiological summary of the COVID-19 pandemic behavior during the first wave of the outbreak in Egypt. The article covers mathematical modeling predictions, Egypt’s healthcare system, economic and social impacts of COVID-19, as well as national responses that were crucial to the initial containment of the pandemic. We observed how the government managed the outbreak by enhancing testing capacity, contact tracing, announcing public health and social measures (PHSMs), as well as allocating extra funds and human resources to contain SARS-COV-2. Prospectively, economic losses from major sources of revenues—tourism, travel, and trade—may be reflected in future timelines, as Egypt continues to control cases and loss of life from COVID-19. Overall, trends indicate that the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt was initially contained. Revalidation of prediction models and follow-up studies may reveal the aftermath of the pandemic and how well it was managed in Egypt.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OQf5cy

medical,"Introduction: It is a common patient perception that their discharge from hospital is delayed by waiting for medicines (1). However, it is important to consider the entire discharge process when addressing this problem (2). In our large tertiary referral hospital, clinical pharmacy services were moved from wards to the dispensary following a staffing crisis during 2018. Ward-based services were reintroduced in 2020, but doubts remained over the practicality and benefits of doing this. Aim: To compare the efficiency of ward and dispensary based clinical pharmacy services in our hospital in terms of interventions made and time taken. Methods: We completed an observational service evaluation. Data on the time taken to process discharge medication requests with the dispensary-based service were collected retrospectively from the hospital electronic discharge system for 12 months (2018) for five medical wards. Equivalent data for the ward-based service were collected prospectively over three days (2020) by pharmacists delivering the service to seven medical wards, as this was considered more accurate, and several process steps did not exist in the ward-based model. For example, prescriber sending request to pharmacy and pharmacy acknowledging receipt of a request. The prospective data collection period was curtailed by Covid-19. Descriptive statistics were produced using Excel. Results: Using the dispensary-based service (2018), 4459 medicine requests were processed from 5 medical wards, during a 12-month period. The mean time between prescribing and reaching the screening pharmacist was 175 minutes [95%CI ± 25.4]. It took an estimated time of 62 minutes [95%CI ± 2.99] to screen and resolve an intervention, with a mean of 3 interventions/ward/day. In 2020, using the ward-based approach to clinical pharmacy which screened medicine requests on the ward, 142 requests were screened over three days from seven wards, with no delay between prescribing and clinical screening. It took a mean of 17 minutes [95%CI ± 10.63] to screen and resolve an intervention, with a mean of 15 interventions/ward/day. Conclusion: Ward based pharmacy yielded five times more interventions, took an average of 45 minutes less to screen and resolve issues per request and removed 175 minutes of process time. The additional time required to resolve issues identified in the dispensary-based screening process was thought to be the delay in contacting either the appropriate member of the ward staff referencing a particular patient for information or identifying and contacting the prescriber, or a combination of both. This study is limited by the long delay between data collection periods and the small sample size in 2020, but the differences between the two systems were large and there had been few other changes to hospital systems. Other limitations include changes related to Covid-19 and the lack of a control group, so it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between the type of pharmacy service and study outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",96V9S3

The objective of this study is to determine whether SARS‐CoV‐2 was present in resected specimens from patients with acute bowel ischemia, but asymptomatic for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and with persistently real‐time polymerase chain reaction negative pharyngeal swab. METHODS: Three consecutive patients presented severe abdominal symptoms due to extensive ischemia and necrosis of the bowel, with co‐existent thrombosis of abdominal blood vessels. None had the usual manifestations of COVID‐19, and repeated pharyngeal swabs tested negative. They underwent emergency surgery with intestinal resection. Immunohistochemical testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 on resected tissue was performed. RESULTS: All tested samples were strongly positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report in which patients with severe intestinal symptoms presented a marked SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity in the resected tissues, without any usual clinical manifestations of COVID‐19.

My question is that are these symptoms related to HIV or again I have to take another HIV test? Recently I did a WBC count test and it is 12000.I have got Vitamin D test results as 16.6 ng/ml.

The former seems to be faster than the latter. On the other hand, the design of heuristics for bandwidth reduction is a very consolidated research area.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Little guidance exists regarding how best to upskill and support those delivering complex healthcare interventions to ensure robust trial outcomes and implementation fidelity. Mentoring was provided to occupational therapists (OTs) delivering a complex vocational rehabilitation (VR) intervention to stroke survivors. This study aimed to explore mentors’ roles in supporting OTs with intervention delivery and fidelity, and to describe factors affecting the mentoring process and intervention delivery. METHODS: Quantitative data (duration, mode and total time of mentoring support) was extracted from mentoring records and emails between mentors and OTs, alongside qualitative data on barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery. Semi-structured interviews with mentors (n = 6) and OTs (n = 19) explored experiences and perceptions of intervention training, delivery and the mentoring process. Mean total and monthly time spent mentoring were calculated per trial site. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Forty-one OTs across 16 sites were mentored between March 2018 and April 2020. Most mentoring was provided by phone or Microsoft Teams (range: 88.6–100%), with the remainder via email and SMS (Short Message Service) text messages. Mentors suggested strategies to enhance trial recruitment, improved OTs’ understanding of- and adherence to trial processes, intervention delivery and fidelity, and facilitated independent problem-solving. Barriers to mentoring included OT non-attendance at mentoring sessions and mentors struggling to balance mentoring with clinical roles. Facilitators included support from the trial team and mentors having protected time for mentoring. CONCLUSIONS: Mentoring supported mentee OTs in various ways, but it remains unclear to what extent the OTS would have been able to deliver the intervention without mentoring support, or how this might have impacted fidelity. Successful implementation of mentoring alongside new complex interventions may increase the likelihood of intervention effectiveness being observed and sustained in real-life contexts. Further research is needed to investigate how mentors could be selected, upskilled, funded and mentoring provided to maximise impact. The clinical- and cost-effectiveness of mentoring as an implementation strategy and its impact on fidelity also requires testing in a future trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12464275.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an indigenous anxiety scale for adults and to assess the prevalence of anxiety among the adults. METHODS: Descriptive explanatory research design was carried out from 1(st) January 2018 to 31(st) May 2019 at the Department of Psychology, University of Gujrat. The indigenous anxiety scale for adults was used for data collection. Scale consisted on three sub scales which are used to assess the cognitive symptoms, behavior and physiological symptoms through CFA value and alpha reliability. Sample of adequacy is .965, Confirmatory Factor Analysis value .914, alpha reliability .974 were taken as standard. In cognitive symptoms subscale’s alpha was 0.958, Behavior subscale .943 and Physiological symptoms subscale alpha was α .912. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety in 20-29 years individuals exhibited 17.5% (male 38.8%; female 62.2) symptoms of anxiety. 30-39 Years people showed 12.9% (male =56.9%; female=43.1%) , 40-49 years individuals showed 16.5% of anxiety and in late adulthood 50-60 years old people showed highest level of anxiety 22.10% (male=68.3%; female= 31.7).

The mean 24-h PM(10) ranged between 6 and 64 μg/m(3). 24-h PM(2.5) levels were reported from 5 to 56 μg/m(3). About half of the 24-h PM(10) and most of the PM(2.5) values in Chelyabinsk were higher than the WHO recommendations. The mean PM(2.5)/PM(10) ratio was measured at 0.85, indicative of anthropogenic input.

According to a WHO report (2020), it is women who are at a particular risk of the negative effects of the pandemic, especially in terms of mental health. Aim of study: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression, irritability, and loneliness among adult women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The study was conducted on a representative sample of women in Poland (n = 452). The data were collected using the HADS-M scale and the R-UCLA scale. Results: A low level of loneliness was found in 37.3% of the women, moderate in 38.9%, moderately high in 22.3% and very high in 1.3% of women. Self-rating of physical and mental health was significantly positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and irritability in HADS-M, and loneliness in R-UCLA. As the severity of loneliness increased, so did Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores on all subscales (p < 0.001).

medical,"Manufacture of lead-containing products has long been associated with various health risks. To get an insight into the related genotoxic risks, we conducted a biomonitoring study in 50 exposed workers and 48 matched controls using a battery of endpoints that sensitively detect the extent of genome instability in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The levels of primary DNA damage were estimated with the alkaline comet assay, while cytogenetic abnormalities were determined with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay. Additionally, CBMN slides of 20 exposed and 16 control participants were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), coupled with pancentromeric probes to establish the incidence of centromere-positive micronuclei, nuclear buds, and nucleoplasmic bridges. Blood lead levels (B-Pb) were measured with atomic absorption spectrometry. To further characterise cumulative effects of occupational exposure, we measured erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) concentrations and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in blood. We also assessed the influence of serum folate (S-folate) and vitamin B12 (S-B12) on genome stability. Compared to controls, occupationally exposed workers demonstrated significantly higher B-Pb (298.36±162.07 vs 41.58±23.02), MN frequency (18.71±11.06 vs 8.98±7.50), centromere positive MN (C+ MN) (8.15±1.8 vs 3.69±0.47), and centromere negative MN (C- MN) (14.55±1.80 vs 4.56±0.89). Exposed women had significantly higher comet tail intensity (TI) and length (TL) than control women. Furthermore, workers showed a positive correlation between age and nuclear buds and MN, between MN and years of exposure, and between S-B12 levels and TI and ALAD activity, while a negative correlation was found between TI and B-Pb. These findings suggest that occupational settings in the manufacture of lead-containing products pose significant genotoxic risks, which calls for developing more effective work safety programmes, including periodical monitoring of B-Pb and genetic endpoints.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",srG0vA

medical,"BACKGROUND Since 2007, the National Living Donor Assistance Center has provided the most financial support to US living donors meeting specific income criteria by reimbursing travel, meal and lodging expenses. In 2019, the National Kidney Registry (NKR) started providing lost wages, travel and lodging reimbursement via their Donor Shield program. Donor Shield is automatically provided to donors who participate in kidney paired donation through the NKR or who donate at a Donor Shield Direct center, without any income restrictions. METHODS The support donors across the US received from the Donor Shield program between January 2019 and February 2020 was studied. RESULTS During the study period, 326 (25.9%) of the 1,260 donors covered by Donor Shield, from 46 programs received reimbursements amounting to a total of $647,384.45, with $472,389.97 (73.0%) covering lost wages. Median reimbursement per donor was $1,813.80 (range: $44.0 - $ 7,165.63). 81% of 108 reimbursed donors who were surveyed reported that the lack of these reimbursements would have posed a financial hardship, and 4% said they would have been unable to donate without this support.

medical,"I have noticed for about the last 6 or so months when I sit down in a hard-back chair there is an area in the middle to lower section (about where my belly button would be) of my spine that begins to hurt. I have a bruise at the location of the pain -- probably because I am a student and my back is constantly being pressed against hard desk chairs. When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it. I don t have any serious history of either back or muscle issues. I do feel quite restless when sitting down -- I am constantly shifting. I also get the urge to crack my back at least two to three times per day. Any ideas about the pain in the one spot of my spine? Why is it sticking out?

See PDF]ConclusionThe improvement in FC testing compliance with rapid home testing kit compared to laboratory based testing illustrates the benefit of adapting home testing as the standard in future. The considerable increase in compliance by home testing may be due less disruption to patient’s personal life i.e., ability to undergo testing at home, symptoms such as faecal incontinence preventing patients delivering samples to hospital and COVID pandemic compelling patients to stay at home. Adopting rapid FC home testing as standard provides patients with increased locus of control regarding their care, providing health care professionals with rapid results, thus, will improve management of IBD. The ability for patients to perform home test has obvious advantages during the COVID pandemic.ReferencesSands BE. Biomarkers of Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

medical,"Introduction: While countries including India, have taken strong measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 through better diagnostics and treatment, vaccines will provide a lasting solution by enhancing immunity and containing the disease spread. Understanding the adverse effects pattern will help make aware citizens, dismiss false rumours and reduce vaccine hesitancy. Hence the present study describes the pattern of adverse effects reported following COVID-19 vaccination among beneficiaries in Government Medical College, Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, India. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study of pattern of adverse effects reported following COVID-19 vaccination was conducted among 540 beneficiaries in Government Medical College, Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, India from January 2021 to April 2021. Data was collected through online survey which included questions pertaining to immediate & late post vaccination experience. Results: Majority (33%) participants were 18-30 age group and (58%) were male. Overall (73%) respondents reported atleast one post-vaccination symptom. General weakness & tiredness (73.4%), pain at injection site (62%), bodyache (48%), chills (43%) & fever (39%) were the most prevalent symptoms. The frequency of symptoms among 18-30 age group was (85.9%) & more likely to be reported by women (83.2%) compared to men (65.1%). Around (36.9%) beneficiaries who had one or more comorbidities showed post vaccination symptoms. Around (82.1%) of Covishield beneficiaries developed atleast one or more symptoms post vaccination, while (60.3%) of Covaxin beneficiaries developed the same. Conclusion: Nearly two-thirds of study participants reported mild symptoms following vaccination. General weakness & tiredness, pain at injection site, bodyache, chills & fever were the most prevalent symptoms. Symptoms were more common among younger individuals. More Covishield beneficiaries developed atleast one or more symptoms post vaccination compared to Covaxin beneficiaries.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",JT3tXL
medical,"Aim: On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion hit Lebanon's capital city, Beirut. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Beirut blast on the COVID-19 situation in the country. Subject and Methods: Data on COVID-19 were retrieved from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (LMOPH), where all the COVID-19 positive cases were reported. The study was divided into two periods, considering the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus: (July 27-August 9, 2020) and (August 10-23, 2020). Information obtained included daily number of cases, tests, deaths, hospitalized patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and mode of acquisition (local vs. expat). Daily positivity rates were reported per 100 tests. An independent sample t-test and a Joinpoint regression analysis were used to determine significance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 201,010 tests were conducted during our studied period, with 8993 positive cases, constituting a total positivity rate of 4.5 per 100 tests. Case fatality rate over the studied period was 0.8%. The positivity rate of the period prior to August 10, 2020, was 2.7 per 100 tests, significantly less than that of the period following the explosion, which was 6.4 per 100 tests (p < 0.001). During our studied period, daily positivity rates were significantly increasing at a slope of 0.29 (p < 0.001). A significant increase in slope was noted on August 13, 2020 (p < 0.001). The number of hospitalized patients increased from 139 patients on July 27 to 266 on August 23, 2020, and that of ICU patients increased from 36 to 75. Conclusion: The port of Beirut explosion resulted in a significant increase in the daily number of positive COVID-19 cases. The aftermath of the explosion, the damage to healthcare facilities, and the overcrowding due to emergency efforts were contributing factors to that increase.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",E3YAdG
