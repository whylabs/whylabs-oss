medical,"COVID-19 has shown a substantial variation in the rate and severity by which it impacts different demographic groups. Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones.. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",CzaF6v

medical,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the perceptions of health professionals regarding the gaps in mental health service provision in Australia and their need for assistance in managing patients with mental illness. METHOD: A total of 570 health professionals participated in an anonymous online survey in January 2018 that assessed: i) health professionals' current levels of need for assistance in the management of patients with mental health conditions; and ii) perceived gaps in the mental health care system, and how these can be addressed. Data were analysed using a mixed-methods approach. RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 71.2% of health professionals and 77.3% of general practitioners reported that they required assistance in managing their patients with at least one stage of care for at least one type of mental disorder. Qualitative analyses revealed eight major themes in health professionals' perceptions of gaps in mental health service provision, including affordability and accessibility, the problems with crisis-driven care and the 'missing middle'. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of this study provide a concerning insight into the substantial gaps in mental health care within the Australian system. Implications for public health: The results of this study add weight to ongoing calls for reform of and increased investment in the Australian mental health care system.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",wmfshU

medical,"COVID 19 pandemic is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It is an infectious disease and has led to the ongoing global pandemic. This pandemic has also started in Assam, with its first case reported on 31 March, 2020. A prospective study was conducted on 2000 laboratory confirmed coronavirus cases. Proper history were taken and clinical examinations were performed. They were also advised to do the necessary blood investigations, electrocardiogram and chest X- rays. Olfactory functions were assessed using substances like scented soap, mint toothpaste, vicks vaporub, etc. Gustatory functions were also assessed. In our study, we found that 83% (1650) patients presented with otorhinolaryngological or ENT (Ear, nose, throat) manifestations and 17% (350) did not have any otorhinolaryngological manifestations. The most common ENT symptoms with which the patients presented were sore throat (80%) and headache (76%). The other ENT symptoms were hyposmia (44%), dysgeusia (32%) and nasal congestion (28%). The most common non-ENT symptoms were fever (92%) and cough (85%). The other non-ENT symptoms with which the patient presented were malaise, generalized bodyache and abdominal symptoms (like diarrhea). This prospective study gives a view of the incidence of otorhinolaryngological manifestations in COVID 19 patients. But, no significant co-relation was seen between presence of ENT symptoms and the severity of the disease. However, further studies are required to know the pathogenesis of causing ENT symptoms properly and also for definitive treatment of these symptoms.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",v-vQiT

Then I had an incident where I was shoved in my back and my body/back did a whiplash type of move but it was the most painfullest experience that I ever felt, ever step I took, every twist or any move would hurt crucialy. It took awhile to heal when it did it didnt heal all the way, so it seems.

medical,"AIMS: COVID-19, a respiratory viral disease causing severe pneumonia, also affects the heart and other organs. Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6] was indifferent, d-dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID-19 = 23.7% vs. non-COVID-19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID-19 = 17.1% vs. non-COVID-19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID-19. While mortality was also similar, COVID-19 is characterized with increased thrombogenicity and high pulmonary embolism rates.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",U0aBva

The vaccines maintain effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern but the heavily mutated, highly transmissible Omicron variant poses an obstacle both to vaccine protection and monoclonal antibody therapies. Analysis of the neutralization of Omicron spike protein-pseudotyped lentiviruses showed a 26-fold relative resistance (compared to D614G) to neutralization by convalescent sera and 26-34-fold resistance to Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna vaccine-elicited antibodies following two immunizations. A booster immunization increased neutralizing titers against Omicron by 6-8-fold. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by vaccination resulted in the highest neutralizing titers against Omicron. Regeneron REGN10933 and REGN10987, and Lilly LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 monoclonal antibodies were ineffective against Omicron, while Sotrovimab was partially effective.

medical,"Since December 2019, the deadly novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the current COVID-19 pandemic. To date, vaccines are available in the developed countries to prevent the infection of this virus; however, medicines are necessary to help control COVID-19. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) causes the common cold. The main protease (M(pro)) is an essential enzyme required for the multiplication of these two viruses in the host cells, and thus is an appropriate candidate to screen potential medicinal compounds. Flavonols and dihydroflavonols are two groups of plant flavonoids. In this study, we report docking simulation with two M(pro) enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)- dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercitrin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1’, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Their affinity scores ranged from −8.8 to −7.4 (kcal/mol). Likewise, these compounds were predicted to bind and inhibit the HCoV-229E M(pro) activity with affinity scores ranging from −7.1 to −7.8 (kcal/mol). In vitro inhibition assays showed that seven available compounds effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) activity and their IC(50) values ranged from 0.125 to 12.9 μM. Five compounds inhibited the replication of HCoV-229E in Huh-7 cells. These findings indicate that these antioxidative flavonols and dihydroflavonols are promising candidates for curbing the two viruses.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",9nY3DF

We describe the clinical features, treatment trends, and baseline laboratory parameters of a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their association with the outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay, and death. RESULTS: A total of 2080 patients were included. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Among the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5–11) days. Out of 853 (42.3%%) of patients who had COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation, 340 (39.9%) died. Patients aged >45 years had higher odds of death as compared to the 18–44 years age group. Vaccination reduced the odds of death by 40% (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 0.6 [0.4–0.9], P = 0.032). Patients with hyper inflammation at baseline as suggested by leukocytosis (OR [95% CI]: 2.1 [1.5–3.1], P < 0.001), raised d-dimer >500 mg/dL (OR [95% CI]: 3.2 [2.2–4.7], P < 0.001), and raised C-reactive peptide >0.5 mg/L (OR [95% CI]: 3.7 [2.2–13], P = 0.037) had higher odds of death. Patients who were admitted in the 2(nd) week had lower odds and those admitted in the 3(rd) week had higher odds of death. CONCLUSION: This study shows that vaccination status and early admission during the inflammatory phase can change the course of illness of these patients. Improving vaccination rates and early admission of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 can improve the outcomes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lAWWRj

On March 23, the index patient (neonate A), aged 3 days, had feeding intolerance and apnea. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected from neonate A was tested using a single-manufacturer rapid RSV antigen detection test (RRADT) at the hospital laboratory; the result was positive. The following day, because of concern about the possibility of more widespread RSV infection, RRADT was used to test nasopharyngeal swab specimens from neonate B, aged 1 month, who had resided in a different hospital room in the NICU and had developed an increased oxygen requirement, apnea, and poor feeding that day, as well as from two asymptomatic neonates who were hospitalized in the same room with neonate A; all three were positive. Later that day, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the remaining 16 asymptomatic NICU patients were tested using the same RRADT; seven tests were positive, making a total of 11 positives.

medical,"A pandemia da Covid-19, causada pelo novo coronavírus (SARS-CoV-2), é uma das maiores crises de saúde pública que o mundo já enfrentou. Nesse contexto, é importante ter modelos eficazes para descrever os diferentes estágios da evolução da epidemia, a fim de orientar as autoridades competentes na adoção de políticas públicas para o enfrentamento e controle da pandemia. No presente trabalho, nós propomos um novo método de análise de curvas epidêmicas com base na seleção criteriosa de modelos de crescimento, tomando como exemplo as curvas acumuladas de óbitos atribuídos à Covid-19 para os estados da região Nordeste do Brasil. A depender do caso, foram utilizados o modelo q-exponencial, o modelo de Richards ou o modelo generalizado de Richards para fazer o ajuste numérico das respectivas curvas empíricas. Verificou-se que os modelos utilizados descrevem muito bem as curvas empíricas de todos os estados do Nordeste, permitindo assim diagnosticar mais precisamente o estágio da epidemia em cada um dos estados. Dentre eles, apenas o estado da Paraíba ainda encontra-se na fase inicial de crescimento, quando a curva epidêmica ainda não apresenta um ponto de inflexão, sendo nesse caso melhor descrita pelo modelo q-exponencial. Os demais estados foram mais bem descritos ou pelo modelo de Richards ou por sua versão generalizada. O modelo de Richards, em particular, foi capaz de identificar com razoável confiabilidade o surgimento do ponto de inflexão para os estados que só recentemente alcançaram esse estágio da epidemia, como foi o caso do Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte e Sergipe. Esse modelo também é capaz de prever quando a inflexão está prestes a acontecer, como é o caso da Bahia. O modelo generalizado de Richards, por sua vez, mostrou-se mais apropriado para descrever curvas epidêmicas de estados que estão em uma fase mais desenvolvida da epidemia, como Ceará e Pernambuco, quando as curvas epidêmicas já apresentam uma tendência mais consolidada de saturação em direção ao platô.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",WveRMu

medical,"Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost-effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross-linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self-supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC-gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC-water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5× in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC-gels in a scalable fashion from only water and ""food-grade"" constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response-tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant-free food decoration, to short-term sensors in, for example, biodegradable ""smart labels"" for food packaging.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",3D3haK

In recent months, with the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic, the role of portable ventilation systems in reducing the load of virus in indoor air has received much attention. The present study delineates a comprehensive up-to-date overview of the available photocatalysis technologies that have been applied for inactivating and removing airborne viruses. The detection methods for identifying viral particles in air and the main mechanisms involving in virus inactivation during photocatalysis are described and discussed. The photocatalytic processes could effectively decrease the load of viruses in indoor air. However, a constant viral model may not be generalizable to other airborne viruses. In photocatalytic processes, temperature and humidity play a distinct role in the inactivation of viruses through changing photocatalytic rate. The main mechanisms for inactivation of airborne viruses in the photocatalytic processes included chemical oxidation by the reactive oxygen species (ROS), the toxicity of metal ions released from metal-containing photocatalysts, and morphological damage of viruses.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",p-NzHX

As family caregivers provide a good portion of the care for older people, their lives have been drastically altered by COVID-19 too. Our study is an in-depth exploration of the greatest concerns of family caregivers in the United States during COVID-19, as well as their perspectives on the benefits of caregiving during this global pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 52 family caregivers in the United States between May and September of 2020 over video conferencing using a semi-structured interview guide. Thematic analysis was conducted to ascertain our participants' perceptions. Caregiver's concerns were organized into six main themes, including social isolation, decline in mental health, decline in physical and cognitive functioning, keeping their family members safe from COVID-19, lack of caregiving support, and caregiving stress. The themes related to the benefits of caregiving during COVID-19 included: enjoyed the slower pace, increased time to spend together, deepened relationships, recognizing the resilience of family members, and caregiving innovations.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Studies have documented AKI with high-grade proteinuria in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In some patients, biopsies have revealed collapsing glomerulopathy, a distinct form of glomerular injury that has been associated with other viruses, including HIV. Previous patient reports have described patients of African ancestry who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and AKI early in the course of disease. METHODS: In this patient series, we identified six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), AKI, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined biopsy specimens from one transplanted kidney and five native kidneys. Three of the six patients underwent genetic analysis of APOL1, the gene encoding the APOL1 protein, from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. In addition, we purified genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue and performed APOL1 genotype analysis of one of the native biopsies and the donor kidney graft. RESULTS: All six patients were of recent African ancestry. They developed COVID-19-associated AKI with podocytopathy, collapsing glomerulopathy, or both. Patients exhibited generally mild respiratory symptoms, and no patient required ventilator support. Genetic testing performed in three patients confirmed high-risk APOL1 genotypes. One APOL1 high-risk patient developed collapsing glomerulopathy in the engrafted kidney, which was transplanted from a donor who carried a low-risk APOL1 genotype; this contradicts current models of APOL1-mediated kidney injury, and suggests that intrinsic renal expression of APOL1 may not be the driver of nephrotoxicity and specifically, of podocyte injury. CONCLUSIONS: Glomerular disease presenting as proteinuria with or without AKI is an important presentation of COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a high-risk APOL1 genotype.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",lClM7y

medical,"PURPOSE: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis are vulnerable to viral infections like COVID-19 because of the low chance of obedience and complying with rules besides the need for transfer to distant dialysis facilities. We investigated the impact and clinical effect of treatment of COVID-19 in dialysis patients. METHODS: We included patients on maintenance hemodialysis at different healthcare facilities in Zonguldak city. With the diagnosis of the first infected HD case, all other patients who shared the same session were screened. Hospitalized and clinically confirmed cases were included. COVID-19 diagnosis was made based on clinical, biochemical along radiologic findings. RESULTS: 34 (F/M:19/15, mean age 62 ± 13.2 years, dialysis duration 66.9 ± 57.7 months, length of hospital stay 16.2 ± 7.9 days) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of COVID-19 was found to be 18.4% of our exposed population. 38.2% of our patients were initially diagnosed by CT screening while asymptomatic. 35.3% had a fever as the first presenting symptom. Lymphopenia was the most common laboratory finding. Except for one, all had at least one comorbidity. Out of 12 (35.3%) patients admitted to ICU 6(17.6%) died. The deceased patients were older, presented with lower serum albumin and lymphocyte count, and had higher CRP and fibrinogen levels. High CRP level on admission was the only significant predictor of mortality. CONCLUSION: Early detection will lower mortality. In this study, with a low prevalence of COVID-19, the importance of early screening of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was shown to be highly important.

medical,"COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself. The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also discussed.

medical,"Hello doctor, I always had tiny and small bumps on my penis head, from the time I started noticing my penis. But today I saw some white and tiny dot like bumps. Is it any kind of STD? I had intercourse with a sex worker five weeks ago. It was protected and I kept checking my condom after every three or four strokes. I am totally aware of STD and HIV risk and I used a branded condom non-expired one. I stretched it hard to see for any holes or tears and did not see any. When I tried to insert, it broke and at that very second, I heard a popping sound and was out of her. It will be about one or two seconds and not more than that.

medical,"Abstract This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. More than 95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p<0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p<0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PfB6xD

medical,Background Context. Products that can reduce development of epidural fibrosis may reduce risk for ongoing pain associated with development of scar tissue and make subsequent epidural reexploration easier. Purpose. To evaluate the use of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) on the formation of soft tissue scarring in the epidural space. Study Design. Case series. Patient Sample. Five patients having transforaminal lumbar interbody lumbar fusion (TLIF) with posterior instrumentation and implantation of dHACM in the epidural space and subsequent epidural reexploration. Outcome Measures. Degree of scar tissue adjacent to the epidural space at reexploration. Intraoperative and postoperative complications related to dHACM and patient reported outcomes. Methods. The degree of scar tissue adjacent to the epidural space was assessed during the reexploration surgery. Patients' outcomes were collected using standard validated questionnaires. Results. Four of 5 cases had easily detachable tissue during epidural reexploration. Angiolipoma of 10% was noted in 1 case and 5% in 2 cases. Significant improvements in patient reported outcomes were observed. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dHACM implant during TLIF may have favorable effects on epidural fibrosis and is well tolerated.

We used a case-crossover design to examine the association between cell phone usage and traffic injuries of pedestrians, cyclists, and electric bicycle riders during their journey. We studied 643 pedestrians, bike riders or electric bike riders aged between 10 and 35 years who were involved in a road injury, visited the emergency department in one of the three hospitals in Shanghai, China, in 2019, and were cell phone owners. Half of the participants (n = 323, 50.2%) used a cell phone within 1 minute before the injury happened. Pedestrian's or rider's use of a mobile phone up to 1 minutes before a road injury was associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of injury (odds ratio 3.00, 95% confidence interval: 2.04, 4.42, P < 0.001), which was consistent across the groups of sex, occupation, travel reason, modes of transportation, and location of injury.

medical,"Among mutations that occur in SARS-CoV-2, efficient identification of mutations advantageous for viral replication and transmission is important to characterize and defeat this rampant virus. Mutations rapidly expanding frequency in a viral population are candidates for advantageous mutations, but neutral mutations hitchhiking with advantageous mutations are also likely to be included. To distinguish these, we focus on mutations that appear to occur independently in different lineages and expand in frequency in a convergent evolutionary manner. Batch-learning SOM (BLSOM) can separate SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences according by lineage from only providing the oligonucleotide composition. Focusing on remarkably expanding 20-mers, each of which is only represented by one copy in the viral genome, allows us to correlate the expanding 20-mers to mutations. Using visualization functions in BLSOM, we can efficiently identify mutations that have expanded remarkably both in the Omicron lineage, which is phylogenetically distinct from other lineages, and in other lineages. Most of these mutations involved changes in amino acids, but there were a few that did not, such as an intergenic mutation.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_vLXVe

The impact of this is unknown. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of the change in the frequency of ICD-10 code use and patient volumes in the 6 weeks before and after the changes in clinical practice associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: The total number of encounters decreased four-fold after the implementation of clinic changes associated with COVID-19. The low vision, pediatric ophthalmology, general ophthalmology, and cornea divisions had the largest total decrease of in-person visits. Conversely, the number of telemedicine visits increased sixty-fold. The number of diagnostic codes associated with ocular malignancies, most ocular inflammatory disorders, and retinal conditions requiring intravitreal injections increased. ICD-10 codes associated with ocular screening exams for systemic disorders decreased during the weeks post COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmology practices need to be prepared to experience changes in practice patterns, implementation of telemedicine, and decreased patient volumes during a pandemic.

medical,"Multiple perforator flap breast reconstruction is an option that avoids implants in selected patients with minimal donor tissue. The technique addressed the need for additional skin to help create a breast envelope with more natural ptosis and additional volume to help create a body-appropriate breast mound while avoiding serial fat grafting. Using four flaps for the reconstruction of two breasts (bilateral stacked flap reconstruction) has recently become feasible with the advancement of microsurgical techniques, increased experience with alternative perforator flaps and use of co-surgery. Herein, we describe our early experience with bilateral stacked flap breast reconstruction.From 1/2014-10/2018, the senior co-surgeons performed 50 consecutive bilateral stacked flap operations at a single institution. All reconstructions were done in delayed fashion with mean operative time of 10 hours. Most breasts (94%) were reconstructed with a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap combined with a profunda artery perforator flap. Most flap micro-anastomoses (91.5%) were done directly with internal mammary vessels. The larger of the two flaps was typically placed inferiorly (66%), but there was significant inset variability. Of 200 flaps, five were lost (2.5%). Seven take-backs were needed for a flap-related concern, which included two negative explorations and a flap salvage. The most common non-flap-related complication was a thigh wound (17 total, 8 requiring a procedure).Our early experience suggests that bilateral stacked flap breast reconstruction is a powerful tool that can be done with acceptable microsurgical risk and complication profile in highly-selected patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",F3WSME

medical,"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the essential role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on SMEs' performance by exploring the mediating role of corporate image (CI), corporate reputation (CR) and customer loyalty (CL) between CSR and firm performance (FP) in the context of an emerging country. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an extended literature review on CSR, CI, CR and CL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of these four constructs on SMEs' performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. The study sample was composed of 482 responses covering top executives, managers and experts. The Smart PLS SEM version 3.3.2 was used to analyse the data of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of Vietnam in the year 2020–2021. Findings: The authors' findings reveal significant and positive relationships amongst CSR, FP, CSR and CI, CSR and CR, CSR and CL, and most importantly, the findings add value to the current knowledge by exploring the mediating effect of CI, CR and CL between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in Vietnam. As a result, the findings of the study might not be applicable for other countries, if the economic and environmental settings are different from that of Vietnam. Therefore, future research should consider for other countries, other regions. Second, due to the purpose and priority of the study, CI, CR, and CL was employed as mediators amongst the relationship between CSR and FP. Thus, future research should consider other mediators or moderators in such a relationship to see how CSR generates outcomes in the new associations. Practical implications: The study regarding the role of CSR in enhancing the performance of SMEs can motivate firm's chief executive officers (CEOs) to be proactive in getting involved and practising CSR in a consistent manner. Second, the above discussion draws a very important implication for the executive level, the management level of the enterprise, which enterprises should balance the interests of business, customers, other stakeholders, the environment and society in order to optimise CSR outcomes for improving competitiveness and developing sustainably. This implication is particularly important to the survival and development of SMEs in a challenging emerging economy. Social implications: The study widens the literature regarding relationship between CSR and SMEs' performance. Besides, the study supports stakeholder theory that explains why CSR positively affects firm's performance. The significant mediating roles of CI, CR and CL were positively confirmed in the study. Although previous studies determined that such roles are strategic source of competitive advantages of enterprises, however, how CSR involved in enhancing the roles has not been deeply explored and integrated. Third, the findings of the study support the resource-based view (RBV) and resource-based perspective that explains why firm should engage in CSR activities, and CI, CR and CL can enhance firm's performance by providing strategic source of competitive advantages that facilitate business to improve its performance in sustainable direction. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current literature on CSR and FP shows that, to date, there has been little empirical research on the mediating mechanism of CI, CR and CL in the link between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of the study may have great implications for entrepreneurs and top management with respect to the strategic perspectives to drive the businesses and to improve firm's performance in a sustainable direction in the context of emerging markets. In addition, the finding might be of great interest to – and motivate – SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where such businesses were or are situated during and after the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By that understanding, the Government might allow for innovative and groundbreaking policies or the reformation of old policies to leverage busin sses to promote their strengths towards sustainable development in the new economic settings. The findings of the study may be a significant contribution to SMEs in Vietnam and in other emerging economies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_D820X

I had an X-ray and the Dr. was confident that is was a stress fracture but wanted to get MRI to confirm. After looking at the MRI, he said it was not a stress fracture and it was just scar tissue. When I asked questions, he was dismissive and not entirely helpful. So I am just looking for some clarification.

medical,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a highly applicable electrochemical, analytical, and non-invasive technique for materials characterization, which allows the user to evaluate the impact, efficiency, and magnitude of different components within an electrical circuit at a higher resolution than other common electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) or chronoamperometry. EIS can be used to study mechanisms of surface reactions, evaluate kinetics and mass transport, and study the level of corrosion on conductive materials, just to name a few. Therefore, this review demonstrates the scope of physical properties of the materials that can be studied using EIS, such as for characterization of supercapacitors, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), conductive coatings, sensors, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), and other materials. This guide was created to support beginner and intermediate level researchers in EIS studies to inspire a wider application of this technique for materials characterization. In this work, we provide a summary of the essential background theory of EIS, including experimental design, signal responses, and instrumentation. Then, we discuss the main graphical representations for EIS data, including a scope of the foundation principles of Nyquist, Bode phase angle, Bode magnitude, capacitance and Randles plots, followed by detailed step-by-step explanations of the corresponding calculations that evolve from these graphs and direct examples from the literature highlighting practical applications of EIS for characterization of different types of materials.

medical,"Objective: This study aimed to prove the concept of a new optical video-based system to measure Parkinson's disease (PD) remotely using an accessible standard webcam. Methods: We consecutively enrolled a cohort of 42 patients with PD and healthy subjects (HSs). The participants were recorded performing MDS-UPDRS III bradykinesia upper limb tasks with a computer webcam. The video frames were processed using the artificial intelligence algorithms tracking the movements of the hands. The video extracted features were correlated with clinical rating using the Movement Disorder Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and inertial measurement units (IMUs). The developed classifiers were validated on an independent dataset. Results: We found significant differences in the motor performance of the patients with PD and HSs in all the bradykinesia upper limb motor tasks. The best performing classifiers were unilateral finger tapping and hand movement speed. The model correlated both with the IMUs for quantitative assessment of motor function and the clinical scales, hence demonstrating concurrent validity with the existing methods. Conclusions: We present here the proof-of-concept of a novel webcam-based technology to remotely detect the parkinsonian features using artificial intelligence. This method has preliminarily achieved a very high diagnostic accuracy and could be easily expanded to other disease manifestations to support PD management.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nSG6V1

medical,"The classroom closure during the first semester of 2020 entailed decisive changes in higher education. Universities have become more digital in both the availability of e-resources and pervasive devices and how students communicate with lecturers and classmates. Learners adapted their study habits with a growing role of self-paced, internet-based strategies. Some flipped learning approaches have proven their efficacy under the remote-teaching physical constraints. This study aimed to appraise the outcomes from the implementation of various web-based, learning-aid tools on flipped teaching approaches in engineering modules. The open educational resources (OER) performed satisfactorily during the lockdown period in three universities from two countries with similar higher education models. Such resources encompassed classroom response systems and web-based exercise repositories, designed for diverse purposes such as autonomous learning, self-correction, flipped classroom, peer assessment, and guided study. The acquired experiences reveal that OER helped students to enhance their engagement, reach the deeper levels of the cone of learning, and widen their range of learning abilities. This procedure is easily attainable for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) courses and lifelong learning settings. Feedback from students, instructors’ perceptions, and learning outcomes show the suitability and effectiveness of the web-based learning assistant procedure presented here.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gUsWzI

medical,"Many years of unexplained health problems and way to many symptoms to put together when it went on that long undiagnosed. I am a waitress by trade and gave it up a few years back because I was so weak and the headaches were that severe. I never fully understood how my health seemed to have improved the past few years some because now I tend bar and work in second hand smoke . I have had some down time but not like in the past. The past several months I have learned on my own not by a doctor that I severly reacted to anchovie paste that was used in a recipe made by a friend. I have eaten ceasar salad for as long as I can remember. I then had an experience with scollops more body pain and some thoat pain. But before the Christmas Holiday I had a few calamari and then I knew i was on track to all of my unexplained health. My throat closed so bad but I felt like someone had kick bocked my chest and could not expand it at all and get air. I have had this before but not this bad and never fully understanding why it happens. Five weeks back it was a haddock dinner at a local restaurant that had just opened. My throat felt like I had thyroiditis for weeks. I did loose my voice some etc.. I am afraid and will seek medical help eventually. At the moment I am just so mad that it took this long for me or anyone to put together. There is not a specialist I have not seen. I am 54 and it all started at age 39 which is the age I went back to work. Never did I see this connection until recently. When we started to sell Lobster and Steamers I went out of work and thought my symptoms getting much worse had to do with this. I went to an allergist who told me that I was developing a sensitivity but focused on celiac disease and that road ended when my GI doctor ruled it out. I now have seveve ischemic colitis and have been kept overnight in hospital for blood pressure dropping low and another time for intestnal bleeding. My questions are these. Will this heal. I cannot sit for any period of time because of my intestines and cannot lift much because of all that feels damaged inside most days. I have recently talked with a woman who watched what I went through recently and she explained she was in the Islands when she almost went into shock. She had seen prior the same allergist that I had gone to before. Can allergies to seafood and shellfish be trickey to catch??????? I was working long shifts just to keep moving because nothing in my body seems to function good if I stay idle. How much did my working in a restaurant have to do with this getting this bad. It all started many years back with a red face, neck and ears. Always around 3 in the afternoon. Then came the unexplained rash and they focused on detergent. Then I was rushed in and told my appendix but the hospital record shows them circuling they were normal. When I kept going back with the same repeated symptoms stating it is the same pain as before the appendix he yelled I only had one. I said I knew. He moved to Florida shortly after and I have lived years very sick. I had also moved at this time and four restaurants across the street that sold seafood. This is when I was originally sent to be tested for MS the first time. Major swelling, headaches, and no feflex response on left side. It was August and windows open and we thought heat being a trigger. Long road but faith. Will I heal?????? How much plays in to my health failing working and living near seafood restaurants??????????

Some pathogens that were previously not considered to pose a general threat to human health have emerged at regional and global scales, such as Zika and Ebola Virus Disease. Other pathogens, such as yellow fever virus, were previously thought to be under control but have recently re-emerged, causing new challenges to public health organisations. A wide array of new modelling techniques, aided by increased computing capabilities, novel diagnostic tools, and the increased speed and availability of genomic sequencing allow researchers to identify new pathogens more rapidly, assess the likelihood of geographic spread, and quantify the speed of human-to-human transmission. Despite some initial successes in predicting the spread of acute viral infections, the practicalities and sustainability of such approaches will need to be evaluated in the context of public health responses.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uDTAkn

medical,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a tremendous health burden and impact on the world economy. The UK Government implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history at the end of March 2020, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. The UK lockdown was maintained for 7 weeks, but the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing disease transmission remains incompletely understood. METHODS: A Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model was used to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R0) in England was found to be relatively high compared with China. The estimate of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forced lockdown, were effective to reduce transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, forecasting highlights the possibility of a second epidemic wave in several regions. CONCLUSION: This study enhances understanding of the current outbreak and the effectiveness of control measures in the UK.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",IUd6eD

medical,"BACKGROUND: India has the highest number of preterm births and maximum number of deaths due to prematurity. Chengalpattu Government Medical College had 11 593 deliveries annually in 2020, of which 2252 of neonates were low birth weight. 2016 Cochrane review concluded that Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) reduces the morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants. The average duration of KMC in our unit was around 4.6 hours/baby/day. OBJECTIVE: To improve the duration of KMC in stable low birthweight babies from short duration to continuous duration (>12 hours) over 8 weeks. METHODS: The implementation phase was conducted during January 2021 and February 2021. All babies with birth weight <2 kg and who were haemodynamically stable were enrolled. QI (Qualitympovement) team included staff nurses, nursing in charge, resident doctors and consultants. Potential barriers were listed using fishbone analysis. Various possible interventions were identified and a priority matrix was formed to decide the sequence of introduction of changes. The following measures were subsequently tested by multiple PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) cycles: ensuring the availability of KMC charts, combining KMC chart with individualised weight chart, documentation of KMC duration in case sheets, increasing number of KMC chairs, opening of mother–neonatal ICU (M-NICU), KMC slings for mothers, education videos in local language and rewards for mothers. OUTCOME INDICATOR: Duration of KMC, recorded by bedside nurses on daily basis. RESULTS: A total of 86 newborns were enrolled. At the end of 8 weeks, average duration of KMC increased to 16.6 hours/baby/day. The intervention which was most useful in increasing KMC duration was opening of M-NICU. We were able to sustain the improvement at the end of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Sequential measures taken as a part of QI initiative, helped to increase the average duration of KMC from 4.6 hours/day to 16.6 hours/day, without much additional resources.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DQk-GT

The goal of this study is to scrutinize a proposed research model for predicting factors that influence student’s behavioral intention to use e-learning system at Begum Rokeya University, Bangladesh. The study used quantitative approach and developed a research model based on several technological acceptance models. In order to test the model, a survey was conducted to obtain data from 262 university students. SEM-PLS, a multivariate statistical analysis technique, was used to analyze the responses to examine the model, factors, structural relationships, and hypotheses. The result shows that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ positively and significantly influenced by ‘perceived enjoyment’. Furthermore, ‘perceived usefulness’, ‘perceived ease of use’ and ‘facilitating condition’ have a significant impact to predict behavioral intention to use e-learning. The results of mediation analysis show that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ have mediating effects between the predictors and the outcome. Finally, ‘facilitating condition’ have a remarkable moderating effect to predict the student’s behavioral intention in using e-learning.

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragmentation of the healthcare delivery systems and highlighted the role of resilient primary healthcare systems for a robust public health response during health emergencies. Primary care while being the first point of contact between the citizens and the health systems has received scant attention or targeted investments over the past several decades. Through this narrative review, we aim to outline the potential role of telehealth in augmenting health systems capacity. While teleconsultations have increased exponentially during the pandemic, evidence suggests that utilisation of primary care for non-emergency and non-COVID-19 conditions such as chronic medical conditions has significantly decreased, suggesting that most telemedicine utilisation has been to address an immediate crisis. In countries with pre-existing national digital health framework and enabling regulatory environments, telehealth interventions while strengthening the public health response to COVID-19 also supported the continuum of care at the primary care level. Even after COVID-19 is controlled, telemedicine has the potential to address persistent obstacles to primary care in the South East Asia region, including scarcity of trained healthcare workers, access challenges and costs associated with in-person care. Telemedicine holds promise in strengthening primary care and has the potential to catalyse achieving universal health coverage.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zxvrmK
medical,"Background: The SARS-CoV2 infection has rapidly spread throughout the world, particularly affecting those with underlying conditions. Objective: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the most prevalent comorbidities, among people who died of COVID-19 in Romania. Methods: The study comprised 814 deaths caused by COVID-19 between 22nd March and 8th May, 2020 as reported by the Ministry of Health. WHO data regarding deaths of the general population of Romania was used for comparison. The study analyzed the demographics, number and prevalence of comorbidities and calculated the relative risk for each comorbidity. Results: The study sample consisted of 61.4% males and 38.6% females; the mean age was 68.2 y; 90.9% of deaths occurred in people 50+ years. The mean number of pre-existing conditions was 2.73 (SD = 1.521), with 97.4% of the patients having at least one. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (43.1%), diabetes (33.2%), and coronary heart disease (26.0%). The calculated relative risk of death due to COVID-19 was divided into 3 risk categories: high impact comorbidities (RR > 3) included diabetes RR = 6.426 (95% CI, 4.965–8.318), chronic renal disease RR = 4.338 (95% CI, 3.556–5.292) and hypertension RR=3.261 (95% CI, 2.687–3.958). The medium impact (RR = 2–3) group comprised chronic pulmonary disease RR = 2.615 (95% CI, 2.061–3.319) and chronic liver disease RR = 1.577 (95% CI, 1.183–2.104) and the low impact group (RR<2) –coronary heart disease RR = 0.664 (95% CI, 0.581–0.758), cancer RR = 0.515 (95% CI, 0.416–0.637) and stroke RR = 0.468 (95% CI, 0.370–0.593). Conclusion: In the studied sample, SARS-CoV-2 had a greater impact on people with diabetes, chronic renal disease and hypertension and a lesser impact on those with coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke. Therefore, future policies in Romania should focus on shielding people in the high-risk group and prioritizing them for vaccination, whilst encouraging those in the low risk group to continue seeking treatment for their underlying diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",g4PWXo

medical,"The aged care sector in Australia faces significant challenges. While many of these issues have been clearly identified, their urgency has been further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology such as in-home monitoring is one way to address some of these challenges. However, the efficacy of technology must be considered together with its implementation and running costs to ensure that there is a return on investment, and it is economically viable as a solution. A pilot program was run in-home monitoring system to test the efficacy of this system. This paper focuses on an economic analysis to better understand the financial viability of such systems. Using a secondary analysis approach, the findings identified that revenue could be generated by providing carers with additional services such as real-time monitoring of the client, which can foster deeper relationships with the customer, along with savings of healthcare costs to carers, service providers and Government. Savings are related to the earlier intervention of critical events that are identified by the system, as delays in treatment of some critical events can create much more severe and costly health outcomes. Further health costs savings can be made via trend analysis which can show more nuanced health deterioration that is often missed. The implementation of preventative measures via this identification can reduce the chances of critical events occurring which have much higher costs. Overall, monitoring systems lead to a transition from a reactive to a preventative services offering, delivering more targeted and personalised care.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",PKLkF5

medical,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the entire healthcare system and required a huge re-organization of many Divisions, including those of Gastroenterology. AIMS: to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology Divisions across Italy. METHODS: All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. RESULTS: Data of 121 hospitals from all 20 Italian regions were analyzed. Overall, 10.7% Gastroenterology Divisions have been converted to Covid Units. Outpatients consultations, endoscopic and ultrasound procedures were limited to urgencies and oncology indications in 85.1%, 96.2% and 72.2% of Units, respectively, and 46.7% of them suspended the screening for colorectal cancer. Moreover, 72.2% of the staff received a training for use of personal protective equipment, although 45.5% did not have sufficient devices for adequate replacement. Overall, 132 healthcare workers in 41 Gastroenterology Divisions were found to be infected. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate, at a country level, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Gastroenterology Divisions.

To reduce the risk of spread in the most vulnerable patients (those with heart disease) and health personnel, most face-to-face consultations have been replaced by telemedicine consultations. Although this change has been rapidly introduced, it will most likely become a permanent feature of clinical practice. Nevertheless, there remain serious doubts about organizational and legal issues, as well as the possibilities for improvement etc. In this consensus document of the Spanish Society of Cardiology, we attempt to provide some keys to improve the quality of care in this new way of working, reviewing the most frequent heart diseases attended in the cardiology outpatient clinic and proposing some minimal conditions for this health care process. These heart diseases are ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In these 3 scenarios, we attempt to clarify the basic issues that must be checked during the telephone interview, describe the patients who should attend in person, and identify the criteria to refer patients for follow-up in primary care. This document also describes some improvements that can be introduced in telemedicine consultations to improve patient care.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",HC_tTS

medical,"AIMS: The BMA's survey results (Caring for the Mental Health of the Medical Workforce, 2019) and HEE's NHS Staff and Learners’ Mental Wellbeing Commission report (2019) highlighted declining staff wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened focus on this and the effects of moral injury on healthcare professionals. Shielding, social distancing and redeployment led to many medical trainees being increasingly isolated at a time of heightened anxiety and adversity. Psychiatry trainees tend to have good access to reflective groups, but this is not customary in other training programmes. METHOD: Intervention “Trainees4trainees” was set up by trainees across specialties as a HEE-TV well-being project, led by the Deanery Trainee Improvement Fellow. Peer support groups are run on Zoom, facilitated by 2 trainees with special training in peer support. Psychiatry trainees have been involved in designing and facilitating groups and training facilitators from other specialties; facilitators have regular supervision from a consultant psychiatrist in medical psychotherapy. Trainees are supported to discuss challenging experiences and think about their emotional responses in a supportive and validating group. RESULT: Feedback We are in the process of formal data collection to assess the impact of the intervention. Informal feedback suggests the groups are a powerful support to individuals who otherwise have no avenue to think about the psychological impact of their experiences. The groups have supported trainees to feel less isolated and bolstered their resilience. CONCLUSION: Future plans We have faced challenges in the practicalities of establishing and maintaining groups. We are working with Training Programme Directors to move towards running the groups in protected time within working hours and advocate that reflective groups, such as our peer support groups, are a key part of future medical and surgical Training Programmes.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",dT_2VX

medical,"Background Myocardial involvement, especially with ventricular tachycardia as an initial presentation, is uncommon in scleroderma. Case A 56 year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea, palpitations and bilateral hand arthralgias. Physical examination showed regular tachycardia, no jugular venous distension, clear lungs, no cardiac murmurs and skin thickening of digits of both hands. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. CXR showed bibasilar interstitial prominence. Laboratory studies showed troponin 0.15 ng/mL, normal BNP, WBC 2.27 K/uL and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR. 24 hours after admission, he developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and hypotension, responding to amiodarone, lidocaine and IV fluids. Cardiac catheterization showed no CAD. CT chest showed no pulmonary embolism but lower lobe reticular, ground-glass opacities. Echocardiogram revealed moderate LV systolic dysfunction and inferolateral hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed similar wall motion abnormalities and diffuse sub-epicardial myocardial scar. Decision-making The patient was arrhythmia free on sotalol and carvedilol. Transbronchial lung biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids were started empirically. A defibrillator was placed for secondary prevention. Rheumatoid factor was negative, anti-CCP weakly positive (25 u), ANA &gt;1:320, ACE levels normal, ESR 69 mm/h, CRP 15.2. He was diagnosed with scleroderma and started on Cellcept. Three months after hospitalization, he is free of ventricular arrhythmias and arthralgias are improved Conclusion Cardiac involvement in autoimmune disease can lead to rhythm abnormalities and sudden cardiac death (1);it is often missed in scleroderma and if found, diagnosis is usually made more than one year after rheumatologic diagnosis (2). Autoimmune myocarditis (AM) is associated with poor prognosis (3). Early initiation of anti-arrhythmic agents, medical optimization for LV dysfunction, ICD placement and corticosteroids/immunosuppressants have benefited our patient.

medical,"Patient: Male, 73-year-old Final Diagnosis: Pseudoaneurysm • thrombus Symptoms: Chest pain • sycope Medication: — Clinical Procedure: — Specialty: General and Internal Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), when associated with acute left ventricular (LV) free-wall rupture, is often a lethal complication, and if not followed by sudden death, the rupture may be contained by the parietal pericardium and a local thrombus, leading to the formation of a left ventricular (LV) pseudoaneurysm. The incidence of LV pseudoaneurysm after STEMI is ~ 0.3%. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man who presented with an acute syncopal episode and intermittent chest pain for 7 days was found to have an anterolateral myocardial infarction (MI) with lateral wall rupture and pseudoaneurysm formation. He had an LV thrombosis in the LV aneurysm. While this increased his risk of thromboembolic events, it likely stopped the evolution of the rupture and stabilized the pericardial effusion size. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), thrombectomy, and lateral wall repair. CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm and left ventricular thrombus in a patient presenting with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a rare complication of myocardial infraction, with an incidence of <1%.

medical,"Bariatric revision surgery is associated with several complications that can be attributed to decreased quality of tissue and complexity of the surgery. A laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a simple technique with potential advantages. Therefore, the results of this procedure were evaluated as a revisional option. Fifty-one patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Indications for the LSG were insufficient weight loss (34 patients, group 1) or vomiting (17 patients, group 2) following a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Patient and procedure characteristics as well as outcome were collected prospectively. From October 2006 to June 2010, 51 patients with a failed prior bariatic procedure (VBG or LAGB) were converted to (L)SG. The conversion rate was zero. The median procedure time was 99 min (range 54-221) and hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-38). There was no mortality after 30 days. Complications included bleeding (six) and leakage of the staple line (seven). Mean follow-up was 13.8 (2-46) months. LSG as revision surgery for insufficient weight loss resulted in extra weight loss of 52.7%, and the overall extra weight loss was 49.3%. When LSG was performed because of vomiting, 82% was able to eat solid food at follow-up. Of the 65 pre-existent co-morbidities, 21 were resolved and 18 improved. LSG as a revision procedure is feasible. An additional weight loss and further resolution of co-morbidity seem achievable, however, at the cost of a high number of complications. Therefore, revision bariatric surgery should be limited to expert tertiary bariatric centers.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DfH2qw

medical,"Purpose To present the response of the Israel National Transplantation Center (NTC) to the evolving challenge of COVID-19, the impact on deceased organ donation and living organ kidney donation during 2020, and resultant policy and ethical implications. Methods Data collected included (i) for deceased donors, the total number of potential organ donors, if hospitalized in ICU or general ward, cause of death, number of family authorizations and refusals, number of actual donors, number of organs transplanted/donor and total number of transplants performed;(ii) for living-kidney-donors (related or altruistic), the number of procedures performed;and (iii) the number of patients registered on the national organ waiting-list. Results Following the first case (February 2020), deceased organ donation continued uninterrupted. The total number of potential donors was similar to 2019 (181 vs. 189). However, the number of families approached for donation decreased significantly (P = 0.02). This may be attributed to COVID-19-imposed limitations including fewer brain death determinations due to limited possibilities for face-to-face donor coordinator-donor family interactions providing emotional support and visual explanations of the medical situation. Fewer donors were admitted to ICU (P = 0.1) and the number of organs retrieved/donor decreased (3.8/donor to 3.4/donor). The overall result was a decrease of 24.2% in the number of transplant procedures (306 vs. 232). Living kidney donation, initially halted, resumed in May and the total number of procedures increased compared to 2019 due to a significant increase in altruistic donations (P < 0.0001), while the number of related-living donations decreased. Conclusion This study of organ donation during a crisis has informed the introduction of policy changes in the NTC including the necessity to mobilize rapidly a “war room”, the use of innovative virtual tools for contact-less communication, and the importance of cooperation with hospital authorities in allocating scarce health-care resources. Finally, the pandemic highlighted and intensified ethical considerations, such as under what circumstances living kidney donation be continued in the face of uncertainty, and what information to provide to altruistic donors regarding a prospective recipient, in particular whether all options for related living donation have been exhausted.

medical,"A worldwide effort is ongoing to discover drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far caused >3.5 million fatalities (https://covid19.who.int/). The virus essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex is targeted by several nucleoside/tide analogues whose mechanisms of action and clinical potential are currently evaluated. The guanosine analogue AT-527, a double prodrug of its 5'-triphosphate AT-9010, is currently in phase III clinical trials as a COVID19 treatment. Here we report the cryo-EM structure at 2.98 Å resolution of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 complex with RNA showing AT-9010 bound at three sites of nsp12. At the RdRp active-site, one AT-9010 is incorporated into the RNA product. Its 2'-methyl group prevents correct alignment of a second AT-9010 occupying the incoming NTP pocket. The 2'-F, 2'-methyl 3'-OH ribose scaffold explains the non-obligate RNA chain-termination potency of this NA series for both HCV NS5 and SARS-CoV RTCs. A third AT-9010 molecule 5'-diphosphate binds to a coronavirus-specific pocket in the nsp12 N-terminus NiRAN domain, a SelO pseudo-kinase structural and functional homologue. This unique binding mode impedes NiRAN-mediated UMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp8 and nsp9 proteins.

medical,"mRNA vaccines have emerged as a most promising and potent platform in the fight against various diseases including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the intrinsic instability, varying side effects associated with the delivery systems, and continuous emergence of virus variants highlight the urgent need for the development of stable, safe and efficacious mRNA vaccines. In this study, by screening a panel of proprietary biodegradable ionizable lipidoids, we reported on a novel mRNA vaccine (cmRNA-1130) formed from a biodegradable lipidoid with eight ester bonds in the branched tail (AX4) and synthetic circular mRNA (cmRNA) encoding the trimeric Delta receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for the induction of robust immune activation. The AX4-based lipid nanoparticles (AX4-LNP) revealed much faster elimination rate from liver and spleen in comparison with commercialized MC3-based LNP (MC3-LNP) and afforded normal level of alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine (CRE) in BALB/c mice. Following intramuscular (IM) administration in BALB/c mice, cmRNA-1130 elicited potent and sustained neutralizing antibodies, RBD-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T effector memory cells (Tem), and Th1-biased T cell activations. cmRNA-1130 vaccine showed excellent stability against 6-month storage at 4 {degrees}C and freezing-thawing cycles. In brief, our study highlights mRNA vaccines based on cmRNA and biodegradable AX4 lipids hold great potential as superb therapeutic platforms for the treatment of varying diseases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fOukKI

They seem to be gradually getting bigger and sit just below the temples. Also for quite some time the tops of her eyes are puffer and sometimes look as if a little bruised. She has a condition that is similar to hydro nephrons. Her situation is a little different as they can not find any obstruction or tightening of tubes or kidney issues etc... But kidneys and tubes remain swollen. Could the face swelling be connected. Los she had a slightly lazy eye when little and remained ever so slightly now. When she was smaller she went through a whole heap of changes that scared me many times she had wired head twitches that continued for months. Tilted head to one side and still des that occasionally. Her ears Keats bothered her and till this day seem too. She will get my finger and push it in her ears as if to say its hurting or bothering me. Another thing that is unusual with her eyes is that you have the coloured part of eye and then the white, with hers you have the coloured part, then a really intensified solid white, then a section of grayish white.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes polynesiensis inhabits Pacific islands and territories and transmits arboviruses and parasites. In the context of rapid environmental change, understanding the effects of environmental heterogeneity on mosquitoes is crucial. METHODS: First, empirical field data and remote sensing data were combined to model spatial heterogeneity in the environmental suitability for Ae. polynesiensis. Second, a model of mosquito population dynamics was applied to predict mosquito distributions over a heterogeneous landscape assuming different dispersal behaviours. Motu Tautau, French Polynesia, was used as a case study of the utility of this methodological approach. Ae. polynesiensis use land crab Cardisoma carnifex burrows for oviposition in French Polynesia; environmental suitability was therefore quantified using C. carnifex burrow density. RESULTS: Micro-regions with large Ae. polynesiensis populations facilitated by high C. carnifex burrow density were accurately captured by our methodology. Preferential dispersal towards oviposition sites promoted larger population sizes than non-preferential dispersal but did not offer greater resilience to environmental change. Reduced environmental suitability for Ae. polynesiensis resulted in spatially non-linear effects upon the mosquito distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental change has complex spatial effects upon mosquito populations. Mosquito control strategies must carefully balance spatial effects with net effects.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",l_sEVG

medical,"The spread of COVID-19 is recent in India, which has within 4 months caused over 190 000 infections, as of 1 June 2020, despite four stringent lockdowns. With the current rate of the disease transmission in India, which is home to over 1.35 billion people, the infection spread is predicted to be worse than the USA in the upcoming months. To date, there is a major lack of understanding of the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in India, inhibiting effective measures to control the pandemic. We collected all the available data of the individual patients, cases and a range of parameters such as population distribution, testing and healthcare facilities, and weather, across all Indian states till May 2020. Numerical analysis was conducted to determine the effect of each parameter on the COVID-19 situation in India. A significant amount of local transmission in India initiated with travellers returning from abroad. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are currently the top three infected states in India with doubling time of 14.5 days. The average recovery rate across Indian states is 42%, with a mortality rate below 3%. The rest 55% are currently active cases. In total, 88% of the patients experienced symptoms of high fever, 68% suffered from dry cough and 7.1% patients were asymptomatic. In total, 66.8% patients were males, 73% were in the age group of 20–59 years and over 83% recovered in 11–25 days. Approximately 3.4 million people were tested between 1 April and 25 May 2020, out of which 4% were detected COVID-19-positive. Given the current doubling time of infections, several states may face a major shortage of public beds and healthcare facilities soon. Weather has minimal effect on the infection spread in most Indian states.

We explore the enormous build-up of global debt even before the pandemic commenced and the subsequent record debt expansion through mid-2021. New debt peaks, especially for non-financial corporate debt, is analyzed as to its potential impact on future default rates and the implications for the U.S. credit markets once again starting a new benign cycle in a continuing low interest rate environment. We ask the question whether the spectacular success of the U.S. central bank and its monetary policy and secondary market purchases has also promoted potentially destructive unforeseen consequences for debt rated BBB and below. Large versus small firm defaults and bankruptcies are examined in both 2020 and 2021, as well as our expectations about these firms’ solvency status once the government and central bank supports diminish and are eliminated.

Additionally, providing adequate level of patient care while maintaining the transport of a critically ill COVID-19 patient is essential. In this part, patient safety, health care worker safety, bystander safety and post-transport decontamination, which are the main principles forming the basis of safe critically ill COVID-19 patient transport were reviewed per the published reports and the recommendations of current guidelines.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",35J6m-
medical,"RNAs can do many things. They can store information, act in the world, and respond to the world. Because of these capabilities biologists have proposed a primordial ‘RNA world’ in which RNA, rather than DNA, performed the central role of replicator and repository of adaptive information. Deacon dismisses this hypothesis because replication is not about anything and because the structure of replicating molecules cannot contain information about the environment. I dispute both claims. An RNA and its opposite-sense complement represent each other and, by two rounds of complementation, represent themselves. Although (with some exceptions) nucleic acid sequences do not change in response to their present environment, these sequences embody information about ancestral environments via the selective filtering of alternative sequences in those environments.

medical,"Infectious diseases are potential drivers for human evolution, through a complex, continuous and dynamic interaction between the host and the pathogen/s. It is this dynamic interaction that contributes toward the clinical outcome of a pathogenic disease. These are modulated by contributions from the human genetic variants, transcriptional response (including noncoding RNA) and the pathogen’s genome architecture. Modern genomic tools and techniques have been crucial for the detection and genomic characterization of pathogens with respect to the emerging infectious diseases. Aided by next-generation sequencing (NGS), risk stratification of host population/s allows for the identification of susceptible subgroups and better disease management. Nevertheless, many challenges to a general understanding of host–pathogen interactions remain. In this review, we elucidate how a better understanding of the human host-pathogen interplay can substantially enhance, and in turn benefit from, current and future applications of multi-omics based approaches in infectious and rare diseases. This includes the RNA-level response, which modulates the disease severity and outcome. The need to understand the role of human genetic variants in disease severity and clinical outcome has been further highlighted during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

medical,"The COVID-19 pandemic was declared at the beginning of 2020. The healthcare workforce has centered their efforts in treating the acute effects of the disease, trying to salvage as much lives as possible. This has placed a huge burden over healthcare human and economic resources. Over a year later, it is becoming clearer that the sequelae of the disease might turn into its own kind of overwhelming disability burden. Respiratory, neurologic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms are present in approximately 87 % of patients that presented even mild symptoms;a severe disease is a high-risk predictor for these long-term consequences. A rehabilitation program to recover these patients is going to become a relevant as the pandemic acute stage starts to fade. The rapid development of new technologies and interventions based on biological signals evaluations and monitoring must come fast, to meet the rehabilitation demand that is already here. In Mexico with almost 2 million positive cases and 1.5 million recovered patients by February 10th, 2021, about 1.3 million people (80 %) might need some level of rehabilitation to be able to reincorporate to the work force and to return to being productive, for their families and their communities. © 2021 IEEE.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",K5PcZq

However, literature is devoid of studies on the impact of SeNPs and/or metformin (M) against streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated oxidative brain injury and behavioral impairment. Consequently, to fill this gap, diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by feeding with 10% fructose solution for 2 weeks, followed by a single dose intraperitoneal injection of STZ (40 mg/kg body weight [bwt]). After rats were confirmed diabetic, they were treated orally with 0.1 mg/kg bwt of SeNPs ± M (50 mg/kg bwt), and normal control (NC) received citrate buffer (2 mg/mL) for 5 weeks. In comparison with the diabetic control (DC), SeNPs, and/or M significantly (p < 0.05) lowered blood glucose levels, but increased insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell function. An increase in locomotor and motor activities evidenced by improved spontaneous alternation, locomotor frequency, hinding, and increased mobility time were observed in treated groups. In addition, there was enhanced brain antioxidant status with a lower acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative-inflammatory stress biomarkers. A significant downregulation of caspase 3 and upregulation of parvalbumin and Nrf2 protein expressions was observed in treated groups. In some of the studied parameters, treated groups were statistically (p < 0.05) insignificant compared with the normal control (NC) group.

medical,"PURPOSE: To characterize the use of telemedicine for oncology care over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern New England with a focus on factors affecting trends. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study using patient visit data from electronic health records from hematology-oncology and radiation-oncology service lines spanning the local onset of the pandemic from March 18, 2020, through March 31, 2021. This period was subdivided into four phases designated as lockdown, transition, stabilization, and second wave. Generalized linear mixed regression models were used to estimate the effects of patient characteristics on trends for rates of telemedicine use across phases and the effects of visit type on patient satisfaction and postvisit ER or hospital admissions within 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 19,280 patients with 102,349 visits (13.1% audio-only and 1.4% video) were studied. Patient age (increased use in age < 45 and 85 years and older) and urban residence were associated with higher use of telemedicine, especially after initial lockdown. Recent cancer therapy, ER use, and hospital admissions in the past year were all associated with lower telemedicine utilization across pandemic phases. Provider clinical department corresponded to the largest differences in telemedicine use across all phases. ER and hospital admission rates in the 2 weeks after a telehealth visit were lower than those in in-person visits (0.7% v 1.3% and 1.2% v 2.7% for ER and hospital use, respectively; P < .001). Patient satisfaction did not vary across visit types. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine use in oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic varied according to the phase and patient, medical, and health system factors, suggesting opportunities for standardization of care and need for attention to equitable telemedicine access.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",nz8UUt

Three further pigs (group 2) received PRRSV alone, two (group 3) received PRV alone, and two (group 4) remained as uninfected controls. Despite the admittedly small numbers of animals, the experiment appeared to throw light on aspects of synergy. Thus, the group 1 pigs showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors. Total cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in all PRRSV-infected pigs, and PRRSV antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages. Total cell numbers in the cerebrospinal fluid of group 1 pigs were considerably greater than those demonstrated in group 3, but no PRV antigen was found. Pigs of groups 1 and 2 showed pulmonary lesions, characterized by interstitial pneumonia and PRRSV antigen immunolabelling. Non-suppurative encephalitis was found in five of the six pigs of groups 1 and 3.

medical,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has caused tremendous economic losses in the global swine industry since it was discovered in the late 1980s. Inducing host translation shutoff is a strategy used by many viruses to optimize their replication and spread. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV infection causes host translation suppression, which is strongly dependent on viral replication. By screening PRRSV-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps), we found that nsp2 participates in the induction of host translation shutoff and that its transmembrane (TM) domain is required for this process. nsp2-induced translation suppression is independent of protein degradation pathways and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). However, the overexpression of nsp2 or its TM domain significantly attenuated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an alternative pathway for modulating host gene expression. PRRSV infection also attenuated the mTOR signaling pathway, and PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff could be partly reversed when the attenuated mTOR phosphorylation was reactivated by an activator of the mTOR pathway. PRRSV infection still negatively regulated the host translation when the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation were completely reversed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces host translation shutoff and that nsp2 is associated with this process. Both eIF2α phosphorylation and the attenuation of the mTOR signaling pathway contribute to PRRSV-induced host translation arrest.IMPORTANCE Viruses are obligate parasites, and the production of progeny viruses relies strictly on the host translation machinery. Therefore, the efficient modulation of host mRNA translation benefits viral replication, spread, and evolution. In this study, we provide evidence that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces host translation shutoff and that the viral nonstructural protein nsp2 is associated with this process. Many viruses induce host translation shutoff by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). However, PRRSV nsp2 does not induce eIF2α phosphorylation but attenuates the mTOR signaling pathway, another pathway regulating the host cell translational machinery. We also found that PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff was partly reversed by eliminating the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation or reactivating the mTOR pathway, indicating that PRRSV infection induces both eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent and -independent host translation shutoff.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_22rdf

medical,"Recently, especially given the consequences of COVID-19, external migration processes have become more intense. In Kazakhstan and other neighboring post-Soviet countries, a certain social imbalance is associated with the protracted transition period from the Soviet past to the social order and economy of the future. A widening gap exists between the countries of this region associated with geopolitics;for example, states have to choose the Western or Eastern geopolitical vector of development. Russia has a dramatic effect on the development, economy, and migration of neighboring states with a weaker economy. In this regard, the research focuses on the study of key drivers, factors, and reasons affecting this imbalance in the context of the social strata of Kazakhstan. Based on economic and statistical analysis methods, the study analyzes the current migration situation in Kazakhstan and the CIS region, assesses the level of adaptation of citizens of Kazakhstan to the changing environment and globalization that affects the young population;the mechanism of the influence of regional vectors of geopolitics on Kazakhstan is also determined. Apart from this, the current work examines the propensity of young people to migrate abroad (expressed using an integrated indicator) and provides a regression analysis of factors affecting its level. This allowed assessing the degree of influence of the youth unemployment rate and the general welfare of the country on the inclination to go overseas to find a better job. The paper concludes by arguing that the level of unemployment among the young population has a significant impact on its tendency to migrate. In particular, in Kazakhstan, migration abroad is primarily connected with the possibility to get better career prospects and living conditions provided by the host countries. The research results could be used to manage socio-political and socio-economic issues related to the migration of young people in Kazakhstan and neighboring countries and conduct further research related to analyzing macroeconomic indicators and other factors affecting migration processes. © 2021, Florida Gulf Coast University.

medical,"Background and study aim: Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a rapidly evolving research field. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) plays a key role in shaping opinion and endoscopy activity throughout Europe and further afield. Establishing key unanswered questions within the field of endoscopy and prioritizing those that are important enables researchers and funders to appropriately allocate resources. Methods: Over 2 years, the ESGE Research Committee gathered information on research priorities and refined them through a modified Delphi approach. Consultations were held with the ESGE Governing Board and Quality Improvement Committee to identify important unanswered questions. Research workshops were held at the 21st United European Gastroenterology Week. Research questions were refined by the ESGE Research Committee and Governing Board, compiled into an online survey, and distributed to all ESGE members, who were invited to rank each question by priority. Results: The final questionnaire yielded 291 responses from over 60 countries. The three countries with the highest response rates were Spain, Italy, and United Kingdom. Most responders were from teaching hospitals (62 %) and were specialist endoscopists (51 %). Responses were analyzed with weighted rankings, resulting in prioritization of 26 key unanswered questions. The top ranked generic questions were: 1) How do we define the correct surveillance interval following endoscopic diagnosis? 2) How do we correctly utilize advanced endoscopic imaging? 3) What are the best markers of endoscopy quality? Conclusion: Following this comprehensive process, the ESGE has identified and ranked the key unanswered questions within the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Researchers, funders, and journals should prioritize studies that seek to answer these important questions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",z477jf
medical,"BACKGROUND: Food insecurity, as an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantages and a determinant of health, may be associated with injury by increasing risk exposure and hampering risk mitigation. We examined the association between food insecurity and common causes of injury in the general population. METHODS: Linking the Canadian Community Health Survey 2005–2017 to National Ambulatory Care Reporting System 2003–2017, this retrospective cohort study estimated incidence of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits by food insecurity status among 212,300 individuals 12 years and above in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, adjusting for prior ED visits, lifestyle, and sociodemographic characteristics including income. RESULTS: Compared to those in food-secure households, individuals from moderately and severely food-insecure households had 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.25) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.24–1.48) times higher incidence rate of ED visits due to injury, respectively, after confounders adjustment. The association was observed across sex and age groups. Severe food insecurity was associated with intentional injuries (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.81; 95% CI 1.29–2.53) including self-harm (aRR 1.87; 95% CI 1.03–3.40) and violence (aRR 1.79; 95% CI 1.19–2.67) as well as non-intentional injuries (aRR 1.34; 95% CI 1.22–1.46) including fall (aRR 1.43; 95% CI 1.24–1.65), medical complication (aRR 1.39; 95% CI 1.06–1.82), being struck by objects (aRR 1.43; 95% CI 1.07–1.91), overexertion (aRR 1.31; 95% CI 1.04–1.66), animal bite or sting (aRR 1.60; 95% CI 1.08–2.36), skin piercing (aRR 1.80; 95% CI 1.21–2.66), and poisoning (aRR 1.65; 95% CI 1.05–2.59). Moderate food insecurity was associated with more injuries from violence (aRR 1.56; 95% CI 1.09–2.21), falls (aRR 1.22; 95% CI 1.08–1.37), being struck (aRR 1.20; 95% CI 1.01–1.43), and overexertion (aRR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04–1.50). Moderate and severe food insecurity were associated with falls on stairs and being struck in non-sports settings but not with falls on same level or being struck during sports. Food insecurity was not related to transport injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Health inequity by food insecurity status extends beyond diseases into differential risk of injury, warranting policy intervention. Researchers and policymakers need to address food insecurity as a social determinant of injury to improve health equity.

Billions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Mix-and-Match COVID-19 vaccines involving the mixing of the same platform vaccines and also two different vaccine platforms may provide greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. COVID-19 vaccines have become one of the most important tools to mitigate the ongoing pandemic COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We describe SARS-Cov-2 variants, their impact on the population, COVID-19 vaccines, diverse vaccine platforms, doses of vaccines, the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, mitigation of the COVID-19 transmission- alternatives to vaccines. EXPERT OPINION: Diverse vaccine platforms may safeguard against ongoing, deadly SARS-CoV-2 and its infectious variants. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines are significantly high after the administration of the second dose.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support–free days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of −1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support–free days, or both. RESULTS: Both tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support–free days was 10 (interquartile range, −1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, −1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9% and of 99.5%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9%. All secondary analyses supported efficacy of these interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with Covid-19 receiving organ support in ICUs, treatment with the interleukin-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab improved outcomes, including survival.

medical,"Purpose Many nursing homes worldwide have been hit by outbreaks of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to assess the contribution of a- and presymptomatic residents and healthcare workers in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in three nursing homes. Methods Two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, among residents and healthcare workers of three Dutch nursing homes with recent SARS-CoV-2 introduction. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was conducted with reporting of cycle threshold (Ct). Participants were categorized as symptomatic, presymptomatic or asymptomatic with standardized symptom assessment. Results In total, 297 residents and 542 healthcare workers participated in the study. At the first point-prevalence survey, 15 residents tested positive of which one was presymptomatic (Ct value>35) and three remained asymptomatic (Ct value of 23, 30 and 32). At the second point-prevalence survey one resident and one healthcare worker tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (Ct value >35 and 24, respectively) and both remained asymptomatic. Conclusion This study confirms a- and presymptomatic occurrence of Covid-19 among residents and health care workers. Ct values below 25 suggested that these cases have the potential to contribute to viral spread. However, very limited transmission impeded the ability to answer the research question. We describe factors that may contribute to the prevention of transmission and argue that the necessity of large-scale preemptive testing in nursing homes may be dependent of the local situation regarding prevalence of cases in the surrounding community and infection control opportunities.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",tVIMLQ

medical,"We consider the problem of identifying infected individuals in a population of size N. We introduce a group testing approach that uses significantly fewer than N tests when infection prevalence is low. The most common approach to group testing, Dorfman testing, groups individuals randomly. However, as communicable diseases spread from individual to individual through underlying social networks, our approach utilizes network information to improve performance. Network grouping, which groups individuals by community, weakly dominates Dorfman testing in terms of the expected number of tests used. Network grouping's outperformance is determined by the strength of community structure in the network. When networks have strong community structure, network grouping achieves the lower bound for two-stage testing procedures. As an empirical example, we consider the scenario of a university testing its population for COVID-19. Using social network data from a Danish university, we demonstrate network grouping requires significantly fewer tests than Dorfman. In contrast to many proposed group testing approaches, network grouping is simple for practitioners to implement. In practice, individuals can be grouped by family unit, social group, or work group.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",uwEqHZ

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was defined as a species of beta coronavirus causing atypical respiratory disease in humans. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide. Little is known about the specifics of its influence on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence and mortality in PLWHA co-infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The databases PUBMED, EMBASE, BioRxiv, and medRxiv were searched up to 9 March 2021 to explore the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA. Cohort studies and case series meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible studies, 9 of which were cohort and 5 were case series. A total of 203,761 patients with COVID-19 were identified (7718 PLWHA vs. 196,043 non-PLWHA). Meta-analyses estimated the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA was 0.774% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00393-0.01517] and 8.814% (95% CI 0.05766-0.13245) respectively. COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA do not seem to be associated with higher mortality, as compared to non-PLWHA [relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.06)]. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, RR 5.2 (95% CI 4.25-6.36), hypertension and chronic cardiac disease, RR 4.2 (95% CI 1.09-16.10), and chronic kidney disease, RR 8.43 (95% CI 5.49-12.93) were associated with an increased mortality in COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA were 0.774% and 8.814%, respectively. Since most of the included studies used unmatched populations, comparisons between PLWHA and non-PLWHA should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cluster of differentiation 4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and COVID-19 related prognosis in PLWHA.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",oyK5Y7
medical,"BACKGROUND Despite decennia of experience, ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis is still associated with high complication rates. The development of automatic vessel sealers has resulted in the revival of a promising surgical alternative to the conventional procedure: close rectal dissection. By preserving the mesorectal layer it is hypothesized that nerve-related and other postoperative complications can be reduced. METHODS All patients with ulcerative colitis with indication for restorative proctocolectomy at our institution during the pilot study underwent the close rectal pouch procedure with temporary diverting ileostomy. Standardized clinical history, anorectal physiology measurements, and endoscopic and histological examination were carried out before and after surgery. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in all 10 patients, with a median age of 41 years and a median postoperative follow-up period of 16 months. There were no cases of pelvic sepsis and bladder or sexual dysfunction. The median daytime defecation frequency was 6.0. Endoscopic and histological examination showed no abnormalities. The anorectal physiology supported the good functional results.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Hospital testing for respiratory pathogens is nonsystematic, leading to potential missed detection of clinically relevant pathogens. The Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance program monitors hospitalizations due to acute respiratory illness and conducts systematic testing for several respiratory pathogens. We assessed viruses detected by the hospital and additional detections identified by expanded testing. METHODS: Residual upper respiratory specimens collected from patients hospitalized for suspected respiratory illness for routine diagnostic testing at three hospitals, including one children’s hospital, were submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Specimens were tested for 18 respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Clinical and hospital test data were collected through medical record review. RESULTS: From September 2015 to August 2016, 2,351 hospitalized SARI patients were reported, with the following age distribution: 57% <5 years, 13% 5–17 years, 30% ≥18 years. Among all SARI patients, 97% (2,273) had hospital-based, clinician-directed testing for viral pathogens. Viruses were detected among 47% (1,077) of tested patients, among which testing methods included PCR (85%), rapid antigen (13%), and culture (2%); 74% were tested on the day of admission. Most common viruses detected by clinical testing included respiratory syncytial virus (41%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (31%), and influenza (15%) (Figure 1). Systematic RT–PCR testing at MDH identified 1,600 (68%) patients positive for ≥1 respiratory virus, identifying previously unknown detections among 35% (820) of SARI patients (Figure 2). Of 1,272 patients with no virus identified at the hospital, 46% (586) had a viral detection at MDH. Patients aged <18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged ≥18 years (P < 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

medical,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of pulmonary function impairment after COVID-19 in persistently symptomatic and asymptomatic patients of all disease severities and characterisation of risk factors. METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent prospective follow-up with pulmonary function testing and blood gas analysis during steady-state cycle exercise 4 months after acute illness. Pulmonary function impairment (PFI) was defined as reduction below 80% predicted of DLCOcSB, TLC, FVC, or FEV1. Clinical data were analyzed to identify risk factors for impaired pulmonary function. RESULTS: 76 patients were included, hereof 35 outpatients with mild disease and 41 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Sixteen patients had critical disease requiring mechanical ventilation, 25 patients had moderate–severe disease. After 4 months, 44 patients reported persisting respiratory symptoms. Significant PFI was prevalent in 40 patients (52.6%) occurring among all disease severities. The most common cause for PFI was reduced DLCOcSB (n = 39, 51.3%), followed by reduced TLC and FVC. The severity of PFI was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Further risk factors for DLCO impairment were COPD (p < 0.001), SARS-CoV-2 antibody-Titer (p = 0.014) and in hospitalized patients CT score. A decrease of paO2 > 3 mmHg during cycle exercise occurred in 1/5 of patients after mild disease course. CONCLUSION: We characterized pulmonary function impairment in asymptomatic and persistently symptomatic patients of different severity groups of COVID-19 and identified further risk factors associated with persistently decreased pulmonary function. Remarkably, gas exchange abnormalities were revealed upon cycle exercise in some patients with mild disease courses and no preexisting pulmonary condition.

A total of 303 clinical specimens were collected from 163 patients suspected to have SARS. The end point of both WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays was determined to be 0.1 50% tissue culture infective dose. Using seroconversion to CoV as the ""gold standard"" for SARS CoV diagnosis, WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays exhibited diagnostic sensitivities of 61 and 68% (nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens), 65 and 72% (throat swab specimens), 50 and 54% (urine specimens), and 58 and 63% (stool specimens), respectively, with an overall specificity of 100%. For patients confirmed to have SARS CoV and from whom two or more respiratory specimens were collected, testing the second specimen increased the sensitivity from 64 and 71% to 75 and 79% for the WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays, respectively.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) is currently the most popular technique for treating primary osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal joint. However, reduced trapezial height has sometimes been reported after LRTI. Longer immobilization and delayed rehabilitation times are also problematic. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent our modified LRTI procedure. METHODS: Retrospective study included 26 thumbs in 24 cases with advanced stages. Our modified Burton's procedure was as follows: (1) trapeziectomy was limited to distal-half, (2) the entire flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was harvested from the forearm, and (3) half-slip of the FCR tendon was stabilized by interference screw in the first metacarpal bone tunnel. RESULTS: Pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS), the quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score, tip pinch strength significantly improved postoperatively. The preoperative height of the trapezial space was well-maintained at final follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging at the one-year follow-up showed the existence of FCR tendon ball in 15 cases. Eighteen housewives resumed their daily activities after a mean period of 10 days postoperative, while another 6 patients returned to their original jobs after 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified LRTI method involves distal-half trapeziectomy and entire FCR interposition. A sewn FCR tendon ball always provide enough volume to fill the trapeziectomy space, which helps to prevent sinking of the metacarpal bone.

medical,"The conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to substrates is a well-described post-translational modification that regulates protein activity, subcellular localization, and protein–protein interactions for a variety of downstream cellular activities. Several studies describe SUMOylation as an essential post-translational modification for successful viral infection across a broad range of viruses, including RNA and DNA viruses, both enveloped and un-enveloped. These viruses include but are not limited to herpes viruses, human immunodeficiency virus-1, and coronaviruses. In addition to the SUMOylation of viral proteins during infection, evidence shows that viruses manipulate the SUMO pathway for host protein SUMOylation. SUMOylation of host and viral proteins greatly impacts host innate immunity through viral manipulation of the host SUMOylation machinery to promote viral replication and pathogenesis. Other post-translational modifications like phosphorylation can also modulate SUMO function. For example, phosphorylation of COUP-TF interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) leads to its SUMOylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The SUMOylation of CTIP2 and subsequent degradation prevents CTIP2-mediated recruitment of a multi-enzymatic complex to the HIV-1 promoter that usually prevents the transcription of integrated viral DNA. Thus, the “SUMO switch” could have implications for CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression of HIV-1 in latency and viral persistence. In this review, we describe the consequences of SUMO in innate immunity and then focus on the various ways that viral pathogens have evolved to hijack the conserved SUMO machinery. Increased understanding of the many roles of SUMOylation in viral infections can lead to novel insight into the regulation of viral pathogenesis with the potential to uncover new targets for antiviral therapies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",fOUtW3

medical,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare organisations have had to make adaptations to reduce the impact of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This has necessitated urgent reconfiguration within inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services to ensure safety of patients and staff and seamless continuity of care provision. AIM: To describe the adaptations made by a large inflammatory bowel disease service, caring for over 3,500 IBD patients, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A diary record of responses to the pandemic were logged, and meeting minutes were reviewed. Data were recorded from IBD advice lines, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting minutes, infusion unit attendances, and electronic referral systems for the 8-week period from 9 March 2020 until 2 May 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: The IBD service at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (IBD Hull) instituted rapid structural and functional changes to the service. Outpatient services were suspended and substituted by virtual consultations, and inpatient services were reduced and moved to ambulatory care where possible. The delivery of biologic and immunomodulatory therapies was significantly modified to ensure patient and staff safety. There was a substantial increase in IBD advice line calls. CONCLUSION: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a prompt response, regular reassessment and planning, and continues to do so. We share our experience in of the successful adaptations made to our IBD service.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DPQGS0

medical,"The ability to exchange affective cues with others plays a key role in our ability to create and maintain meaningful social relationships. We express our emotions through a variety of socially salient cues, including facial expressions, the voice, and body movement. While significant advances have been made in our understanding of verbal and facial communication, to date, understanding of the role played by human body movement in our social interactions remains incomplete. To this end, here we describe the creation and validation of a new set of emotionally expressive whole-body dance movement stimuli, named the Motion Capture Norming (McNorm) Library, which was designed to reconcile a number of limitations associated with previous movement stimuli. This library comprises a series of point-light representations of a dancer’s movements, which were performed to communicate to observers neutrality, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Based on results from two validation experiments, participants could reliably discriminate the intended emotion expressed in the clips in this stimulus set, with accuracy rates up to 60% (chance = 20%). We further explored the impact of dance experience and trait empathy on emotion recognition and found that neither significantly impacted emotion discrimination. As all materials for presenting and analysing this movement library are openly available, we hope this resource will aid other researchers in further exploration of affective communication expressed by human bodily movement.

medical,"BACKGROUND Incorrect, delayed and missed diagnoses can contribute to significant adverse health outcomes. Intervention options have proliferated in recent years necessitating an update to McDonald et al's 2013 systematic review of interventions to reduce diagnostic error. OBJECTIVES (1) To describe the types of published interventions for reducing diagnostic error that have been evaluated in terms of an objective patient outcome; (2) to assess the risk of bias in the included interventions and perform a sensitivity analysis of the findings; and (3) to determine the effectiveness of included interventions with respect to their intervention type. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. Publications were included if they delivered patient-related outcomes relating to diagnostic accuracy, management outcomes and/or morbidity and mortality. The interventions in each included study were categorised and analysed using the six intervention types described by McDonald et al (technique, technology-based system interventions, educational interventions, personnel changes, structured process changes and additional review methods). RESULTS Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen of the 20 included studies (including three randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) demonstrated improvements in objective patient outcomes following the intervention. These three RCTs individually evaluated a technique-based intervention, a technology-based system intervention and a structured process change. The inclusion or exclusion of two higher risk of bias studies did not affect the results. CONCLUSION Technique-based interventions, technology-based system interventions and structured process changes have been the most studied interventions over the time period of this review and hence are seen to be effective in reducing diagnostic error. However, more high-quality RCTs are required, particularly evaluating educational interventions and personnel changes, to demonstrate the value of these interventions in diverse settings.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",sxqBtH

medical,"The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic has caused a serious impact on patients suffering from cardiovascular disorders as they are predisposed to COVID infection as well as to exacerbation of their preexisting conditions which can prove to be fatal. Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (nCOVID-19) has a varied effect on the cardiac system ranging from myocardial injury to thromboembolic complications. A significant proportion of patients are noted to have comorbidities. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor is considered the target of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). SARS-Cov-2 leads to imbalance in RAAS activity which is responsible for target organ damage. Recombinant ACE 2 has been shown to restore ACE 2 levels in explanted hearts and restore balanced RAAS activity. nCOVID-19 can have varied cardiac manifestations ranging from acute coronary syndrome to heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary thromboembolism, and pericarditis. The current nCOVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in management strategies for cardiovascular diseases. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction can be fibrinolysed when a primary percutaneous coronary intervention facility with adequate protection is not available. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker needs to be continued in patients with hypertension. Continuity of care for patients with chronic cardiovascular illness needs to be maintained. Management of cardiovascular emergencies needs to be done in a way which ensures the safety of health-care professionals and prevents infection transmission.

medical,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become one of the more dramatic health problems in the century. This disease has enormous consequence for the health care worldwide. In addition to high mortality rate, patients recovered from COVID-19 present short and long-term cardiovascular sequelae including chest pain, myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, dyspnea, breathlessness, postural tachycardia syndrome, and thrombotic complications. The explanations for these clinical manifestations are still uncertain but can involve a constellation of physiological alterations. Hypothesis: To test if COVID-19 survivors have augmented sympathetic outflow, diminished endothelial function, elevated aortic stiffness, and reduced physical capacity compared to healthy individuals. Methods: Nineteen COVID-19 survivors [age: 47.0±2.3 years, BMI: 30.1±1.2 Kg/m2] and eighteen well-matched healthy controls (age: 44.0±2.0 years, BMI: 28.4 ±1.2 Kg.m2] were included in study. COVID-19 survivors were evaluated within 6 months of original diagnosis by RT-PCR. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from fibular nerve (Microneurography), brachial artery flowmediated dilation (BAFMD;Doppler-Ultrasound), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV;Complior), beat-to-beat blood pressure (Peripheral BP;Finometer), heart rate (HR;Electrocardiography) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing) were measured in both groups. Results: MSNA was higher in COVID-19 survivors compared to controls (33.0±1.0 vs. 22.0±1.0 bursts/min, p=0.001). Both BAFMD and VO2peakwere lower in COVID-19 survivors compared to controls (4.6±0.7 vs. 8.2 ±0.8%, p=0.005 and 22.2±1.5 vs. 29.7±1.6 mL/Kg/min p=0.001, respectively). Although COVID-19 survivors had greater cf-PWV than controls (8.6±0.5 m/s vs. 7.4±0.4 m/s, p=0.03), BP and HR were not different between groups. Conclusions: Our study revealed that patients recently recovered from COVID-19 have abnormal neurovascular control, vascular alterations and reduced physical capacity.

medical,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was largely driven by hospital-associated transmission where health care workers experienced the largest burden of disease. In attempting to improve occupational health and infection control procedures to prevent occupationally acquired infections in health care workers, it is important to examine the perceptions of those workers who are expected to adhere to specific policies. The authors conducted 15 focus groups of health care workers representing seven different job classifications in two Canadian provinces where SARS outbreaks occurred in 2003 using a theoretical framework which divided factors associated with self-protective behaviour at work into organizational, environmental, and individual factors. Content analysis of these discussions revealed that workers placed more importance on organizational factors than environmental and individual factors. The results are similar to those of a recently completed literature review of this subject, and should be considered when developing new occupational health initiatives to protect health care workers from existing or emerging respiratory tract infections.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ZeIIu3

This study analyzes the effect of gender on leaders’ NCS and presents theoretical and analytical frameworks of gendered NCS. We analyzed 20 televised appearances by 10 heads of state (five males and five females) from democratic Western countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings revealed that gender had a significant effect on leaders’ NCS, indicating that leaders presented NCS that corresponded to their gender. Male leaders’ masculine NCS included competition, warning, threatening, and scaring behavior, broad proxemics, tension leakage, and illustrative gestures, while female leaders presented feminine NCS of cooperativeness, emotional communication, empathy, optimism, eye contact, and flexible expressions. Furthermore, the effect of gender on leaders’ NCS had an interaction effect with the situation of the pandemic, indicating that countries with a female leader had fewer diseased and severe cases and more calmness and healing NCS. The conclusions present theoretical and analytical frameworks that explain the central effect of gender on contemporary leaders’ NCS.

METHODS: An online, 15-question survey was developed and posted on Facebook and WhatsApp closed surgeon groups. RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 219 participants from South America (87%), North America (7%), Europe (5%), Central America, and Asia. Respondents included medical students (6.4%), surgical residents/fellows (24.2%), and practicing surgeons (69.4%). The most common age group was 35–44 years. When asked which social media platforms they preferred, the video sharing site YouTube (33.3%), the messaging app WhatsApp (21%), and “other” (including videoconferencing sites) (22.3%) were most popular. Respondents reported using social media for surgical education either daily (38.4%) or weekly (45.2%), for an average of 1–5 hours/week. Most (85%) opined that surgical conferences that were cancelled during the pandemic should be made available online, with live discussions.

medical,"In view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patient care, including that of psychiatric patients, is facing unprecedented challenges. Treatment strategies for mental illness include psychotherapy and psychopharmacological interventions. The latter are associated with a multitude of adverse drug reactions (ADR); however, they may currently represent the preferred treatment due to restrictions regarding patient care (i.e. social distancing). Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to a worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to a surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",bq49iu

medical,"The genomic ssRNA of coronaviruses is packaged within a helical nucleocapsid. Due to transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic assembly/packaging signals in the related genomic sequence. Such signals coordinated with the nucleocapsid helical structure were detected and reconstructed in the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The main period of the signals for both viruses was about 54 nt, that implies 6.75 nt per N protein. The complete coverage of ssRNA genome of length about 30,000 nt by the nucleocapsid would need 4,400 N proteins, that makes them the most abundant among the structural proteins. The repertoires of motifs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were divergent but nearly coincided for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained the distributions of assembly/packaging signals over the genomes with non-overlapping windows of width 432 nt. Finally, using the spectral entropy, we compared the load from point mutations and indels during virus age for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found the higher mutational load on SARS-CoV. In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 can be treated as a ""newborn"" virus.

medical,"OBJECTIVE The aim was to formulate practice guidelines on the management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients in the non-critical care setting. PARTICIPANTS The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, and a methodologist. EVIDENCE This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. CONSENSUS PROCESS One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society members, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American Association of Diabetes Educators, European Society of Endocrinology, and the Society of Hospital Medicine reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline. CONCLUSIONS Hyperglycemia is a common, serious, and costly health care problem in hospitalized patients. Observational and randomized controlled studies indicate that improvement in glycemic control results in lower rates of hospital complications in general medicine and surgery patients. Implementing a standardized sc insulin order set promoting the use of scheduled basal and nutritional insulin therapy is a key intervention in the inpatient management of diabetes. We provide recommendations for practical, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and describe protocols, procedures, and system improvements required to facilitate the achievement of glycemic goals in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes admitted in non-critical care settings.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_aQx5f

medical,"In early 2020, the Covid-19 crisis forced medical institutions worldwide to convert quickly to online platforms for content delivery. Although many components of medical education were adaptable to that format, anatomical dissection laboratory lost substantial content in that conversion, including features of active student participation, three-dimensional spatial relationships of structures, and the perception of texture, variation, and scale. The present study aimed to develop and assess online anatomy laboratory sessions that sought to preserve benefits of the dissection experience for first-year medical students. The online teaching package was based on a novel form of active videography that emulates eye movement patterns that occur during processes of visual identification, scene analysis, and learning. Using this video-image library of dissected materials, content was presented through asynchronous narrated laboratory demonstrations and synchronous/active video conference sessions and included a novel, video-based assessment tool. Data were obtained using summative assessments and a final course evaluation. Test scores for the online practical examination were significantly improved over those for previous in-person dissection-based examinations, as evidenced by several measures of performance (Mean: 2015-2019: 82.5%; 2020: 94.9%; P = 0.003). Concurrently, didactic test scores were slightly, but not significantly, improved (Mean: 2015-2019: 88.0%; 2020: 89.9%). Student evaluations of online sessions and overall course were highly positive. Results indicated that this innovative online teaching package can provide an effective alternative when in-person dissection laboratory is unavailable.

medical,"BACKGROUND Patients with solid or hematological tumors, neurological and immune-inflammatory disorders are potentially fragile subjects at increased risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 and an inadequate response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS We designed a prospective Italian multicentrer study to assess humoral and T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients (n = 378) with solid tumors (ST), hematological malignancies (HM), neurological disorders (ND) and immunorheumatological diseases (ID). A group of healthy controls was also included. We analyzed the immunogenicity of the primary vaccination schedule and booster dose. RESULTS The overall seroconversion rate in patients after 2 doses was 62.1%. Significantly lower rates were observed in HM (52.4%) and ID (51.9%) than in ST (95.6%) and ND (70.7%); a lower median antibody level was detected in HM and ID versus ST and ND (P < 0.0001). Similar rates of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response were found in all disease groups, with a higher level observed in ND. The booster dose improved the humoral response in all disease groups, although to a lesser extent in HM patients, while the T-cell response increased similarly in all groups. In the multivariable logistic model, independent predictors of seroconversion were disease subgroup, treatment type and age. Ongoing treatment known to affect the immune system was associated with the worst humoral response to vaccination (P < 0.0001) but had no effect on T-cell responses. CONCLUSIONS Immunosuppressive treatment more than disease type per se is a risk factor for a low humoral response after vaccination. The booster dose can improve both humoral and T-cell responses.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pF4Lb5
medical,"Proteome-wide identification of protein-protein interactions is a formidable task which has yet to be sufficiently addressed by experimental methodologies. Many computational methods have been developed to predict proteome-wide interaction networks, but few leverage both the sensitivity of structural information and the wide availability of sequence data. We present PEPPI, a pipeline which integrates structural similarity, sequence similarity, functional association data, and machine learning-based classification through a naïve Bayesian classifier model to accurately predict protein-protein interactions at a proteomic scale. Through benchmarking against a set of 798 ground truth interactions and an equal number of non-interactions, we have found that PEPPI attains 4.5% higher AUROC than the best of other state-of-the-art methods. As a proteomic-scale application, PEPPI was applied to model the interactions which occur between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells during coronavirus infection, where 403 high-confidence interactions were identified with predictions covering 73% of a gold standard dataset from PSICQUIC and demonstrating significant complementarity with the most recent high-throughput experiments. PEPPI is available both as a webserver and in a standalone version and should be a powerful and generally applicable tool for computational screening of protein-protein interactions.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DW6NaW

medical,"Severe COVID-19 is associated with an overactive inflammatory response mediated by macrophages. Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. We found that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2 and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on FcγRII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher pro-inflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients. Our study suggests that IgG immune complexes might promote the acquisition of an inflammatory signature by neutrophils worsening the course of COVID-19.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",gptMUd
medical,"Background Nanocovax is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 subunit vaccine composed of full-length prefusion stabilized recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S-2P) and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. In a Phase 1 and 2 studies, (NCT04683484) the vaccine was found to be safe and induce a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. Methods We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the Nanocovax vaccine against Covid-19 in approximately 13,007 volunteers aged 18 years and over. The immunogenicity was assessed based on Anti-S IgG antibody response, surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and the types of helper T-cell response by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). The vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated basing on serologically confirmed cases of Covid-19. Findings Up to day 180, incidences of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) were similar between vaccine and placebo groups. 100 serious adverse events (SAE) were observed in both vaccine and placebo groups (out of total 13007 participants). 96 out of these 100 SAEs were determined to be unrelated to the investigational products. 4 SAEs were possibly related, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and investigators. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration. These findings highlight the excellent safety profile of Nanocovax. Regarding immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust IgG and neutralizing antibody responses. Importantly, Anti S-IgG levels and neutralizing antibody titers on day 42 were higher than those of natural infected cases. Nanocovax was found to induce Th2 polarization rather than Th1. Post-hoc analysis showed that the VE against symptomatic disease was 51.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] was [34.4%-64.1%]. VE against severe illness and death were 93.3% [62.2- 98.1]. Notably, the dominant strain during the period of this study was Delta variant. Interpretation Nanocovax 25 microgram (mcg) was found to be safe with the efficacy against symptomatic infection of Delta variant of 51.5%.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",hfSWG0

medical,"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is rare and associated with a suboptimal prognosis. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify prognostic factors, with a particular focus on the dynamics of serum AFP levels during treatment, in AFPGC patients. Data of patients with pathologically diagnosed primary gastric cancer treated with various modalities electronically collected in the medical management systems of 2 hospitals (ie, Shihezi People's Hospital and Shihezi Hospital) in Shihezi city, northwest China, from January 2007 to October 2018 were reviewed. Patients with AFPGC were identified based on serum AFP levels. Associations of the change in serum AFP levels and clinicopathological parameters with treatment response, including the overall response rate and disease control rate, and outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were compared among different groups. Of 2354 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, 96 patients with AFPGC were identified. The objective response rate and disease control rate were significantly higher in patients whose AFP level decreased by ≥50% than in patients whose AFP level decreased by <50% (68.8% vs. 40.6%, and 87.5% vs. 53.1%, respectively, both P < .05). The median OS and PFS were 32.0 (4-74) and 24.0 (1-66) months, respectively, in patients with a ≥50% decline in AFP, and 12.5 (0-69) and 9.0 (0-63) months, respectively, in those with a <50% decline in AFP (both P < .05). On univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor, node, metastasis staging classification stage, liver metastasis, curable surgery, and the decline in the serum AFP level were associated with OS and PFS. A significant decline in the serum AFP level was associated with good treatment response and prognosis in AFPGC. Along with a decline in the serum AFP level, tumor, node, metastasis staging classification stage, liver metastasis, and curable surgery were also independent factors associated with prognosis.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",-ggm-m

The questionnaire designs were constructed from two formats of questionnaire items, including words and sentences, and three types of measuring scales, including a rating scale (5-point intensity; 1 = 'not at all', 5 = 'extremely'), a checklist scale (check-all-that-apply, CATA), and a combination of CATA and rating scales (rate-all-that-apply, RATA; 5-point intensity; 1 = 'slightly', 5 = 'extremely'). The 39 emotional terms of the EsSense Profile® and the 45 wellness terms of the WellSense ProfileTM were translated into Thai, then screened for relevance to herbal drinks. The seven positive emotional terms (active, energetic, good, happy, polite, satisfied, and warm), three negative emotional terms (bored, disgusted, and worried), and five wellness terms (comforted, healthy, invigorated, relaxed, and refreshed) were selected and included in the questionnaire. A central location test was performed to determine the emotion and wellness profiles of five herbal drinks: roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) drink, chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat) drink, ginger (Zingiber officinale) drink, Jubliang (a mixture of eight herbs) drink, and Krachai Dam (Kaempferia parviflora) drink. For herbal drinks, measuring emotion and wellness with a questionnaire using full sentences did not show increased benefit over questionnaires using words alone.

medical,"Background: The phase 3—“mitigation”—of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV‑2 is now imminent also in Germany. Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. Methods: To look at phase 3 from the endpoint—in this case hospital admission—should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. Results: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. Conclusions: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator.

medical,"E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes different human infections. Additionally, it resists common antibiotics due to its outer protective membrane. Natural products have been proven to be efficient antibiotics. However, plant natural products are far less explored in this regard. Accordingly, over 16,000 structures covering almost all African medicinal plants in AfroDb in a structural-based virtual screening were used to find efficient anti-E. coli candidates. These drug-like structures were docked into the active sites of two important molecular targets (i.e., E. coli’s Ddl-B and Gyr-B). The top-scoring hits (i.e., got docking scores < −10 kcal/mol) produced in the initial virtual screening (0.15% of the database structures for Ddl-B and 0.17% of the database structures for Gyr-B in the database) were further refined using molecular dynamic simulation-based binding free energy (ΔG) calculation. Anthraquinones were found to prevail among the retrieved hits. Accordingly, readily available anthraquinone derivatives (10 hits) were selected, prepared, and tested in vitro against Ddl-B, Gyr-B, multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli, MRSA, and VRSA. A number of the tested derivatives demonstrated strong micromolar enzyme inhibition and antibacterial activity against E. coli, MRSA, and VRSA, with MIC values ranging from 2 to 64 µg/mL. Moreover, both E. coli’s Ddl-B and Gyr-B were inhibited by emodin and chrysophanol with IC(50) values comparable to the reference inhibitors (IC(50) = 216 ± 5.6, 236 ± 8.9 and 0.81 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.5 µM for Ddl-B and Gyr-B, respectively). All of the active antibacterial anthraquinone hits showed low to moderate cellular cytotoxicity (CC(50) > 50 µM) against human normal fibroblasts (WI-38). Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) experiments were carried out to reveal the binding modes of these inhibitors inside the active site of each enzyme.

medical,"Background. Protecting young children from pandemic influenza should also reduce transmission to susceptible adults, including pregnant women. Methods. An open study assessed immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a heterologous booster dose of A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1)-AS03(B) (AS03(B) is an Adjuvant System containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion [5.93 mg tocopherol]) in infants and children aged 6 to < 36 months that was given 6 months following 2-dose primary vaccination with A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1)-AS03(B). Vaccines contained 1.9 µg of hemagglutinin antigen and AS03(B). Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses, microneutralization titers, and antineuraminidase antibody levels were assessed for 6 months following the booster vaccination. Results. For each age stratum (defined on the basis of the subject's age at first vaccination as 6 to < 12 months, 12 to < 24 months, and 24 to < 36 months) and overall (n = 113), European influenza vaccine licensure criteria were fulfilled for responses to A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1) 10 days following the booster vaccination. Local pain and fever increased with consecutive doses. Anamnestic immune responses were demonstrated for HI, neutralizing, and antineuraminidase antibodies against vaccine-homologous/heterologous strains. Antibody responses to vaccine-homologous/heterologous strains persisted in all children 6 months following the booster vaccination. Conclusions. Prevaccination of young children with a clade 2 strain influenza A(H5N1) AS03-adjuvanted vaccine followed by heterologous booster vaccination boosted immune responses to the homologous strain and a related clade, with persistence for at least 6 months. The results support a prime-boost vaccination approach in young children for pandemic influenza preparedness. Clinical Trials Registration.

She has a history of high bp, but since two weeks it is normal (120/80 mmHg). On doing an MRI scan, the reports showed right maxillary and bilateral ethmoid sinusitis. Is this sinusitis related to seizures? During the seizures, she gets froth from the mouth and tongue bite. For the first few seconds of seizure, she is conscious, but later she is not able to hear and later on she is good. Sometimes, she says that she forgot things and is not able to sleep properly.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Neurology residents are particularly vulnerable to burnout because of the novel logistical and clinical challenges brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite its implications, knowledge on burnout and its predictors among neurology residents is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among neurology residents during the pandemic, to compare burnout subscale scores and sociodemographic and work characteristics, and to explore residents’ perceptions on how to address burnout. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among all 120 residents from the nine institutions in the Philippines offering neurology residency programs from March to August 2020. We obtained sociodemographic and work characteristics using questionnaire. We measured burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We performed an inductive thematic analysis to analyze perceptions on how to reduce burnout. RESULTS: The response rate was 71.67% (86/120). The mean age was 30.1 ± 3.1 years. Using predefined subscale critical boundaries, the prevalence of burnout was 94% (95% CI 89, 99). The lack of compensation and number of on-duty days influenced emotional exhaustion scores. The number of on-duty days influenced depersonalization scores. Thematic analysis revealed five themes: increasing manpower; self-care; reducing clerical tasks; improving work environment; and adequate compensation. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of burnout among neurology residents during the COVID-19 pandemic was alarmingly high. Reforms in hiring policies, work-hour management, manpower organization, work environment, and logistics may be considered.

medical,"BACKGROUND/AIM: We present the case of a 19-year-old male patient diagnosed concomitantly with extensive thromboses (including two intra-cardiac masses and Budd-Chiari syndrome), as well as acute myeloid leukemia. This necessitated prompt deployment of a monitoring and treatment strategy which included twice-daily blood count assessment, multiple platelet transfusions and anti-coagulation therapy with dose-adjustment per blood count during both induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Multiple factors are believed to contribute to the development of thrombosis in acute leukemia such as diffuse intravascular coagulation, cytokine release and chemotherapy. CASE REPORT: Our patient presented early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying his seeking out medical treatment and we suspect this to have contributed to his 'catastrophic' thrombotic presentation. Well-structured guidelines to help clinicians manage these patients are lacking, and most data are from retrospective analyses or case reports. Our patient continued full-dose anticoagulant therapy until successfully undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant. The thrombi eventually diminished in size, and the patient was not diagnosed with any further thrombotic events.

medical,"BACKGROUND: The Hospital Price Transparency Final Rule, effective January 1, 2021, requires hospitals to post online a machine-readable file that includes payer-specific negotiated commercial prices for all services. The regulation aims to improve the affordability of hospital care by promoting price competition. However, a low compliance level among hospitals would compromise the operational effectiveness of this regulation. Understanding hospitals’ compliance status to the regulation has important implications for its enforcement effort and effectiveness assessment. OBJECTIVE: To analyze nationwide hospitals’ compliance status to the Hospital Price Transparency Rule. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3558 Medicare-certified general acute-care hospitals were examined. MAIN MEASURES: A binary compliance rating was generated by using data collected by Turquoise Health. “Noncompliance” means that no machine-readable file was posted or the posted file contains no commercial negotiated prices. “Compliance” means that a machine-readable file was posted with commercial negotiated prices for at least one insurance plan. KEY RESULTS: As of June 1, 2021, 55% of the 3558 Medicare-certified general acute-care hospitals we examined had not posted a machine-readable file containing commercial negotiated prices. Wide variations of compliance existed across states and hospital referral regions. A hospital’s compliance status is strongly associated with the average compliance status of peer hospitals in the same market. Hospitals with greater IT preparedness, for-profit hospitals, system-affiliated hospitals, large hospitals, and non-urban hospitals had greater compliance. More concentrated hospital markets had greater average compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals take into consideration the behavior of their peers in the same market when making price disclosure decisions. Compliant hospitals are likely to have better IT preparedness, more financial resources and personnel expertise to mitigate the cost required for the implementation of the Price Transparency Rule. The compliance cost, therefore, might be a barrier for some hospitals.

medical,"Persistent infection of domestic cats with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) can lead to a highly lethal, immunopathological disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Interestingly, there are two serotypes, type I and type II FCoVs, that can cause both persistent infection and FIP, even though their main determinant of host cell tropism, the spike (S) protein, is of different phylogeny and displays limited sequence identity. In cell culture, however, there are apparent differences. Type II FCoVs can be propagated to high titers by employing feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a cellular receptor, whereas the propagation of type I FCoVs is usually difficult, and the involvement of fAPN as a receptor is controversial. In this study we have analyzed the phenotypes of recombinant FCoVs that are based on the genetic background of type I FCoV strain Black but encode the type II FCoV strain 79-1146 S protein. Our data demonstrate that recombinant FCoVs expressing a type II FCoV S protein acquire the ability to efficiently use fAPN for host cell entry and corroborate the notion that type I FCoVs use another main host cell receptor. We also observed that recombinant FCoVs display a large-plaque phenotype and, unexpectedly, accelerated growth kinetics indistinguishable from that of type II FCoV strain 79-1146. Thus, the main phenotypic differences for type I and type II FCoVs in cell culture, namely, the growth kinetics and the efficient usage of fAPN as a cellular receptor, can be attributed solely to the FCoV S protein.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",6pNFI0

medical,"OBJECT This paper describes a consecutive series of skull base meningiomas resected using an endoscopic endonasal approach through various corridors at a single institution over 7 years. The impact of case selection and experience, the presence of a cortical cuff between the tumor and surrounding vessels, and brain edema on morbidity and rates of gross-total resection (GTR) were examined. METHODS A retrospective review of a series of 46 skull base meningiomas from a prospective database was conducted. The series of cases were divided by location: olfactory groove (n = 15), tuberculum and planum (n = 20), sellar/cavernous (n = 9) and petroclival (n = 2). Gross-total resection was never intended in the sellar/cavernous tumors, which generally invaded the cavernous sinus. Clinical charts, volumetric imaging, and pathology were reviewed to assess the extent of resection and complications. Cases were divided based on a time point in which surgical technique and case selection improved into Group 1 (surgery prior to June 2008; n = 21) and Group 2 (surgery after June 2008; n = 25) and into those with and without a cortical cuff and with and without brain edema. RESULTS Improved case selection had the greatest impact on extent of resection. For the entire cohort, rates of GTR went from 38% to 76% (p = 0.02), and for cases in which GTR was the intent, the rates went from 63% to 84% (not significant), which was mostly driven by the planum and tuberculum meningiomas, which went from 75% to 91.7 % (nonsignificant difference). The presence of a cortical cuff and brain edema had no impact on outcomes. There were 3 CSF leaks (6.5%) but all were in Group 1. Hence, CSF leak improved from 14.2% to 0% with surgical experience. Lessons learned for optimal case selection are discussed. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcome for endonasal endoscopic resection of skull base meningiomas depends mostly on careful case selection and surgical experience.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Acute viral infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are characterized by the dysregulation of iron metabolism, resulting in high serum ferritin and low iron levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the prospective impact of iron metabolism dysregulation, as expressed by serum Ferritin-to-Iron Ratio (FIR), on the in-hospital prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Serum levels of ferritin and iron, as well as other iron metabolism markers and recognized prognostic indicators of COVID-19 severity, were measured in 362 patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19. The prospective relationship between FIR and the risk of the composite outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admission/in-hospital death was analyzed. RESULTS: In the population examined (mean age 74 ± 15 years, males 55%), the rates of radiographic signs of pneumonia, respiratory distress, and the need for noninvasive ventilation were higher in patients with high FIR (≥29.2, the 75(th) percentile) than in those with low FIR (<29.2, the 75(th) percentile) (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). High FIR was associated with a 1.7-fold (HR 1.709, 95% CI 1.017–2.871, p = 0.043) higher risk of ICU admission/in-hospital death.

In the area of labor markets, the paper argues that Covid will compel most East Asian states to find new ways of utilizing their older workers and to increase the flexibility of their labor markets. In the area of mass migration, the paper examines possible scenarios having to do with North Korean state collapse and urban-rural migration trends in China. Finally, in the military sphere, the paper argues that the Covid crisis could significantly affect nuclear weapons security protocols in the region, the manpower and personnel policies of certain militaries, and the frequency, scope, and size of major exercises. © 2021 The Author(s).

medical,"BACKGROUND Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. OBJECTIVES To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3-6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clinets' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three-step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. MAIN RESULTS We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information.Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence).However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence).Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence).Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence).For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables.Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",YgGZ1j
medical,"Response to vaccines generally varies according to individual factors of the vaccinated subjects such as demographics and immune status. While there are various reports of factors associated with immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, little is known about those of adenovirus vector vaccines. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the relationships of antibody level with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and adverse reactions (ARs) to an adenovirus vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Healthcare workers who planned to receive both the first and second injections of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at Hanyang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, were enrolled in the study. Seven days after each injection, participants were asked to complete an online adverse reaction survey. In addition, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody concentration was measured 4 weeks after the second injection. All participants (n = 447, 100%) showed serologic positivity (≥ 0.8 U/mL) 4 weeks after the second injection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Furthermore, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD concentration was similar among groups when stratified by age, sex, BMI, or presence and severity of AR; multivariable linear regression found no associations between antibody response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and age, BMI, sex, and vaccine-induced ARs. In conclusion, age, sex, obesity, and ARs were not associated with antibody responses after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",W0mT7_

In this article, we propose establishing local Air Quality Enhancement Districts using low-cost air quality sensors. Air quality sensors provide more detailed data on particulate matter concentrations than what is currently provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which will allow communities and individuals to make better informed decisions about activities during poor air quality days. The core principles behind local Air Quality Enhancement Districts is to (1) provide citizens with more localized data on air quality, (2) raise awareness on localized pollution and health impacts related to COVID-19, and (3) empower citizens and local governments to take quick actions to reduce exposure and respiratory distress during times of poor air quality.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",bEj1bN

medical,"Since the worldwide outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19, several studies have been published to understand the structural mechanism of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KdTuPS
medical,"Problem statement. The aim of the study is to verify if the same protocol brings the same results towards the three roles of soccer, in terms of explosive power and speed, and if the COVID-19 affected the performance during the period September-December. Methods. Eighteen (n = 18) Italian elite soccer players, without goalkeepers, participated in this study (age 24.5 +/- 5.9;body weight 75.2 +/- 6.0;height 181.2 +/- 7.1) from July to December, a period in which the whole team was infected by COVID-19. The players were monitored through two specific tests, CMJ and Speed test on 10 meters, detected in three different periods and in relation to three different playing positions: (D) defenders, (M) midfielders and (F) forwards. Soccer players have been trained following the same program training. A 3x3 Mixed-design analysis of variance was used to verify differences between the three roles and the results of the three measurements taken in July, September and December for each test. Results. The results is statistically significant (p < .05) for the within factor in the two tests, but there is no significant effect between groups (p > .05). Conclusion. In relation to the protocol used, we noticed that in terms of speed the forward role had the greatest improvement, while in terms of power in the lower limbs the role of the midfielder. Therefore, it is not possible to use the same training protocol for all roles, but to program your own personalized training plan based on the results of the match analysis and the performance model of each role.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",3of0ra

We outline the findings of a young COVID‐19 patient suffering from idiopathic cardiomyopathy who was treated for acute multi‐organ failure and required cardiac surgery with implantation of a temporary right ventricular and durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). For deeper translational insights, we used in‐depth tissue analysis by electron and light sheet fluorescence microscopy revealing evidence for spatial distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the heart. This indicates that in‐depth analysis may represent a valuable tool in understanding indistinct clinical cases.

medical,"Pulmonary diseases can cause severe respiratory problems, leading to sudden death if not treated timely. Many researchers have utilized deep learning systems to diagnose pulmonary disorders using chest X-rays (CXRs). However, such systems require exhaustive training efforts on large-scale data to effectively diagnose chest abnormalities. Furthermore, procuring such large-scale data is often infeasible and impractical, especially for rare diseases. With the recent advances in incremental learning, researchers have periodically tuned deep neural networks to learn different classification tasks with few training examples. Although, such systems can resist catastrophic forgetting, they treat the knowledge representations independently of each other, and this limits their classification performance. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no incremental learning-driven image diagnostic framework that is specifically designed to screen pulmonary disorders from the CXRs. To address this, we present a novel framework that can learn to screen different chest abnormalities incrementally. In addition to this, the proposed framework is penalized through an incremental learning loss function that infers Bayesian theory to recognize structural and semantic inter-dependencies between incrementally learned knowledge representations to diagnose the pulmonary diseases effectively, regardless of the scanner specifications. We tested the proposed framework on five public CXR datasets containing different chest abnormalities, where it outperformed various state-of-the-art system through various metrics.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ffJS9K

On the 13th day he was sent to a hospice where he spent 29 hours, then died. When dealing with his sudden death I feel he was cheated by not having more of a warning during the prior months or was he just too strong to recognize it? Maybe this cancer (adenocarcinoma) is just so aggressive and we should be glad he went quickly with minimal suffering but my grief is expressed more in anger than in tears of emotion.

medical,"Six years ago I went to the er. Always been super healthy crediting hard work and healthy living. Had a blood pressure of 220/117. Had a ringing in my left ear so much so it was hard to make out what people were saying to me. Blood pressure went down to 190/98 so they sent me home. Went to family doctor a couple days later. She examined me and said she did no know why my blood pressure was so high, the noise now seemed to be in my head than just my ear, and why I then could not turn my neck. She added that she noticed that it had been over 5 years since my last prostate exam and she could check that, that day. And I went home. Realizing it was up to me to survive whatever it was and try to get better. I have always believed I would wake up morning and the battle would be won. I lost my job and took some contract work. As of last year the pain is such that contract work is no longer possible. I don t nor have I ever taken drugs. To my question today. My left shoulder and arm really hurt, and I am good with pain. To the point, if I hold a phone to my ear for more than 5 minutes balancing my elbow on the arm of the chair, my arm locks up. I have to use the other arm to bend it straight and the bicep burns. The right arm will sometimes do the same but not at such a low threshold. In my heart I believe I have some sort of autoimmune thing. There are other symptoms that I believe support what I think but I am in no way an expert. I went to one person a couple years ago, expensive yes but boasted he was an expert. Turned out he was a chiropractor and would you believe if I went to him twice a week he could help me. I don t want to go back to my GP as I feel it would be a waste of her time and my money. I just don t know where the closest place to Southern Indiana that one could go to see a true expert in Autoimmune stuff and such. Do you?

medical,"The dramatic change in various spheres of daily life caused by the COVID-19 virus epidemic has had many ambiguous effects on the Latvian fisheries sector. As part of a national research program project reCOVery-LV to study the virus’s effect on the supply chain, LLU researchers concluded that Latvian fish processing demonstrates a multidirectional effect. The interpretation of statistics and the interviews conducted confirmed the hypothesis that the virus has had negative and positive effects within one sector of the economy. This industry heterogeneity places high demands on support criteria, making them more targeted for successful risk management. The research aims to analyze the fishery sector and identify the COVID-19 pandemic effect on Latvia’s fish sector. As part of the study, all stages of the fish food chain were studied, risks were identified, their relative relevance was determined, and measures were proposed to neutralize these risks. This article summarizes the results of the study, prioritizes the implementation of countermeasures that reduce risks and are recommended by the results of the risk assessment, and complement the results of the study, identifies measures aimed at the long-term and sustainable development of the industry, based on the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

medical,"BACKGROUND: In addition to increasing access to fresh and affordable produce, home gardening enhances food security. This notwithstanding, there is no evidence of studies that have investigated factors correlated with home gardening in Gauteng Province (GP), South Africa. The present study investigated home gardening across the GP. METHODS: Retrospective data of residents of GP (n = 30002) collected by the Gauteng City Region Observatory were used. A binary logistic regression was employed to determine factors correlated with home gardening. RESULTS: Overall participation in home gardening was low (12.37%). If a respondent was a resident of the poorest areas, resided in a house received under the Rural Development Programme, had a borehole/well as the main source of water, belonged to a social club, received a social grant, was >65 years, and rated his/her health as poor, then they were more likely to participate in home gardening. Factors that were negatively correlated with home gardening included if the respondent rented from private individuals and if the respondent's health status prevented him/her from doing daily work. CONCLUSION: The low participation levels in home gardening observed suggest the failure of the current policies geared at fostering home gardening in the province. Policy makers and relevant authorities should target identified groups to improve participation in home gardening.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",wwbi8E
medical,"A method of Transitional Automorphic Mapping of the Genome on Itself (TAMGI) is aimed at combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs in the viral genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The motifs reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zSqIGt

medical,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). A better understanding of its immunogenicity can be important for the development of improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Here, we report the longitudinal analysis of three COVID-19 patients with moderate (#1) and mild disease (#2 and #3). Antibody serum responses were analyzed using spike glycoprotein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), full-proteome peptide, and glycan microarrays. ELISA immunoglobulin A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, and IgM) signals increased over time for individuals #1 and #2, whereas #3 only showed no clear positive IgG and IgM result. In contrast, peptide microarrays showed increasing IgA/G signal intensity and epitope spread only in the moderate patient #1 over time, whereas early but transient IgA and stable IgG responses were observed in the two mild cases #2 and #3. Glycan arrays showed an interaction of antibodies to fragments of high-mannose and core N-glycans, present on the viral shield. In contrast to protein ELISA, microarrays allow for a deeper understanding of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes of the whole proteome and glycans of SARS-CoV-2 in parallel.

medical,"Natural isolates of pathogenic bacteria can exhibit a broad range of phenotypic traits. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to such phenotypic variability, we compared the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of two natural isolates of the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the human disease melioidosis. Significant intrinsic genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic variations were observed between the two strains involving genes of diverse functions. We identified 16 strain-specific regions in the B. pseudomallei K96243 reference genome, and for eight regions their differential presence could be ascribed to either DNA acquisition or loss. A remarkable 43% of the transcriptional differences between the strains could be attributed to genes that were differentially present between K96243 and Bp15682, demonstrating the importance of lateral gene transfer or gene loss events in contributing to pathogen diversity at the gene expression level. Proteins expressed in a strain-specific manner were similarly correlated at the gene expression level, but up to 38% of the global proteomic variation between strains comprised proteins expressed in both strains but associated with strain-specific protein isoforms. Collectively, >65 hypothetical genes were transcriptionally or proteomically expressed, supporting their bona fide biological presence.

Since he s been fine in other places but gets home and is sneezing . He also developed a couple rash-like bumps around the crevices of his nose . He s not allergic to dustmites. So I wonder what it is. It s itchy sometimes and sometimes gets better when aquaphor ointment is applied. Is it something in the house, irritation from blowing his nose, or somehow related to being goalie for hockey ( sweating and not showering right away).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",3mOIVT

medical,"An increase in opioid-overdose deaths was evident before the COVID-19 pandemic, and has escalated since its onset. Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, is the primary driver of these recent trends. The current study used two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and A/J, to investigate the genetics of behavioral responses to fentanyl. Mice were tested for conditioned place preference and fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. C57BL/6J mice formed a conditioned place preference to fentanyl injections and fentanyl increased their activity. Neither effect was noted in A/J mice. We conducted RNA-sequencing on the nucleus accumbens of mice used for fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. Surprisingly, we noted few differentially expressed genes using treatment as the main factor. However many genes differed between strains. We validated differences in two genes: suppressor APC domain containing 1 (Sapcd1) and Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), with quantitative PCR on RNA from the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In both regions A/J mice had significantly higher expression of both genes than did C57BL/6J. In prefrontal cortex, fentanyl treatment decreased Glo1 mRNA. Glyoxalase 1 catalyzes the detoxification of reactive alpha-oxoaldehydes such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, is associated with anxiety and activity levels, and its inhibition reduces alcohol intake. We suggest that future studies assess the ability of Glo1 and related metabolites to modify opioid intake.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jHRL6m

medical,"Squalene is a natural linear triterpene that can be found in high amounts in certain fish liver oils, especially from deep-sea sharks, and to a lesser extent in a wide variety of vegeTable oils. It is currently used for numerous vaccine and drug delivery emulsions due to its stability-enhancing properties and biocompatibility. Squalene-based vaccine adjuvants, such as MF59 (Novartis), AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), or AF03 (Sanofi) are included in seasonal vaccines against influenza viruses and are presently being considered for inclusion in several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemic threats. However, harvesting sharks for this purpose raises serious ecological concerns that the exceptional demand of the pandemic has exacerbated. In this line, the use of plants to obtain phytosqualene has been seen as a more sustainable alternative, yet the lower yields and the need for huge investments in infrastructures and equipment makes this solution economically ineffective. More recently, the enormous advances in the field of synthetic biology provided innovative approaches to make squalene production more sustainable, flexible, and cheaper by using genetically modified microbes to produce pharmaceutical-grade squalene. Here, we review the biological mechanisms by which squalene-based vaccine adjuvants boost the immune response, and further compare the existing sources of squalene and their environmental impact. We propose that genetically engineered microbes are a sustainable alternative to produce squalene at industrial scale, which are likely to become the sole source of pharmaceutical-grade squalene in the foreseeable future.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",abUbLe
medical,"Several patients experience pulmonary sequelae after Sars-Cov-2 infection, ranging from self-limited abnormalities to major lung diseases. Morphological analysis of lung tissue may help in understanding pathogenic mechanisms and provide consistent personalised management. Aim of the study was to ascertain morphologic and immuno-molecular features of lung tissue. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy was carried out in patients with persistent symptoms and computed tomography suggestive of residual lung disease after recovery from Sars-CoV-2 infection. 164 patients were referred for suspected pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19; 10 patients with parenchymal lung disease extent >5% underwent lung biopsy. Histological pattern was not homogeneous, as three different case clusters could be evidenced, which were mirrored in clinical and radiological features: cluster one (“chronic fibrosing”) characterised by post-infection progression of pre-existing interstitial pneumonias; cluster two (“acute/subacute injury”) characterised by different types and grades of lung injury, ranging from organising pneumonia and fibrosing NSIP to diffuse alveolar damage; cluster three (“vascular changes”) characterised by diffuse vascular increase, dilatation and distortion (capillaries and venules) within otherwise normal parenchyma. Clusters two and three were characterised by immunophenotypical changes similar to those observed in early/mild covid-19 pneumonias (abnormal expression of STAT3 in hyperplastic pneumocytes and PD-L1, IDO and STAT3 in endothelial cells).

medical,"The continued resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic with multiple variants underlines the need for diagnostics that are adaptable to the virus. We have developed toehold RNA–based sensors across the SARS-CoV-2 genome for direct and ultrasensitive detection of the virus and its prominent variants. Here, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter protein, for example, LacZ or nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. By optimizing RNA amplification and biosensor design, we have generated a highly sensitive diagnostic assay that is capable of detecting as low as 100 copies of viral RNA with development of bright color. This is easily visualized by the human eye and quantifiable using spectrophotometry. Finally, this PHAsed NASBA-Translation Optical Method (PHANTOM) using our engineered RNA biosensors efficiently detects viral RNA in patient samples. This work presents a powerful and universally accessible strategy for detecting COVID-19 and variants.

medical,"With burgeoning human disease genetic associations and single-cell genomic atlases covering a range of tissues, there are unprecedented opportunities to systematically gain insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal variation. However, sparsity and noise, particularly in the context of single-cell epigenomic data, hamper the identification of disease- or trait-relevant cell types, states, and trajectories. To overcome these challenges, we have developed the SCAVENGE method, which maps causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution by employing the strategy of network propagation. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation including enrichment of blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, defining monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and identifying intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that are critical for predisposition to acute leukemia.

medical,"BACKGROUND: Extensive environmental contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported in hospitals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We report our experience with the practice of directly observed environmental disinfection (DOED) in a community isolation facility (CIF) and a community treatment facility (CTF) in Hong Kong. METHODS: The CIF, with 250 single-room bungalows in a holiday camp, opened on July 24, 2020, to receive step-down patients from hospitals. The CTF, with 500 beds in open cubicles inside a convention hall, was activated on August 1, 2020, to admit newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients from the community. Healthcare workers (HCWs) and cleaning staff received infection control training to reinforce donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and to understand the practice of DOED, in which the cleaning staff observed patient and staff activities and then performed environmental disinfection immediately thereafter. Supervisors also observed cleaning staff to ensure the quality of work. In the CTF, air and environmental samples were collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR. Patient compliance with mask wearing was also recorded. RESULTS: Of 291 HCWs and 54 cleaning staff who managed 243 patients in the CIF and 674 patients in the CTF from July 24 to August 29, 2020, no one acquired COVID-19. All 24 air samples and 520 environmental samples collected in the patient area of the CTF were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patient compliance with mask wearing was 100%. CONCLUSION: With appropriate infection control measures, zero environmental contamination and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCWs and cleaning staff was achieved.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",na-i1v

medical,Coronavirus is a novel human pathogen causing fulminant respiratory syndrome (COVID-19). Developing an effective and reliable vaccine was emergently pursued to control the dramatic spread of the global pandemic. The standard stages for vaccine development were unprecedentedly accelerated over a few months. We report a case of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We attribute the occurrence of NORSE to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship and the lack of risk factors for epilepsy in the patient. This report adds to the literature a possible rare side effect of a COVID-19 vaccine and contributes to the extremely limited literature on potential neurological side effects of viral vector vaccines. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possibility of post-vaccination epilepsy. The patient had recurrent seizures that were refractory to conventional antiepileptic drug therapy with a dramatic response to immunotherapy with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis. This likely reflects an underlying autoimmune mechanism in the genesis of post-vaccination generalized seizures without fever. Further research is needed to probe and study the exact mechanism at a more molecular level.,Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",XHP2IK

medical,"Ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation is a basic posttranscriptional regulation mechanism in bacteria. Liberated attenuator RNAs arising in this process are generally considered nonfunctional. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes are organized into three operons, trpE(G), ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA, and trpFBA-accD-folC, of which only the first one, trpE(G), contains a short ORF (trpL) in the 5′-UTR and is regulated by transcription attenuation. Under conditions of Trp sufficiency, transcription is terminated between trpL and trpE(G), and a small attenuator RNA, rnTrpL, is produced. Here, we show that rnTrpL base-pairs with trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, indicating rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of the trpDC operon in trans. Although all three trp operons are regulated in response to Trp availability, only in the two operons trpE(G) and trpDC the Trp-mediated regulation is controlled by rnTrpL. Together, our data show that the trp attenuator coordinates trpE(G) and trpDC expression posttranscriptionally by two fundamentally different mechanisms: ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in cis and base-pairing in trans. Also, we present evidence that rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression in trans is conserved in Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, suggesting that the small attenuator RNAs may have additional conserved functions in the control of bacterial gene expression.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Uc1NOx

We explored these candidate prognostic and predictive biomarkers with efficacy outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody using data from the COVACTA trial for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Candidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142 patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical ventilation (if not receiving it at randomisation) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models, and additional sensitivity analyses. Findings Modelling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except LDH and D-dimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modelling in the tocilizumab arm showed a predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction p=0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction p=0.01), and clinical status (predictive interaction p=0.02) compared with placebo. Interpretation Multiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in COVACTA.

medical,"Very often, the root of problems found to produce food sustainably, as well as the origin of many environmental issues, derive from making decisions with unreliable or inexistent data. Data-driven agriculture has emerged as a way to palliate the lack of meaningful information when taking critical steps in the field. However, many decisive parameters still require manual measurements and proximity to the target, which results in the typical undersampling that impedes statistical significance and the application of AI techniques that rely on massive data. To invert this trend, and simultaneously combine crop proximity with massive sampling, a sensing architecture for automating crop scouting from ground vehicles is proposed. At present, there are no clear guidelines of how monitoring vehicles must be configured for optimally tracking crop parameters at high resolution. This paper structures the architecture for such vehicles in four subsystems, examines the most common components for each subsystem, and delves into their interactions for an efficient delivery of high-density field data from initial acquisition to final recommendation. Its main advantages rest on the real time generation of crop maps that blend the global positioning of canopy location, some of their agronomical traits, and the precise monitoring of the ambient conditions surrounding such canopies. As a use case, the envisioned architecture was embodied in an autonomous robot to automatically sort two harvesting zones of a commercial vineyard to produce two wines of dissimilar characteristics. The information contained in the maps delivered by the robot may help growers systematically apply differential harvesting, evidencing the suitability of the proposed architecture for massive monitoring and subsequent data-driven actuation. While many crop parameters still cannot be measured non-invasively, the availability of novel sensors is continually growing; to benefit from them, an efficient and trustable sensing architecture becomes indispensable.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",q6ayrX

Additionally, those who had better self-reported satisfaction in social relationships were more susceptible to health rumors. Furthermore, women and older adults showed a greater belief in health rumors. This study expands upon our understanding of how people with different QoL levels interact with false health-related information. Based on health-rumor-susceptible groups, several essential online and offline strategies to govern health rumors are also proposed.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1FjY3b
medical,"This report provides an introduction this COVID-19 and its impact of Sri Lanka Economy. This report is based on information about the COVID-19 epidemic from various sources. COVID-19 has spread over the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a worldwide emergency. In the context of Sri Lanka, the current study investigates the effects of COVID-19 on GDP, Employment, Inflation, Stock market performance, External sector performance and poverty. COVID-19 has a negative impact on both GDP and Employment in Sri Lanka, according to the analysis, despite the magnitude of the impact being substantially smaller than the South Asian average. Apart from that, ‘Panic buying’, disrupted local production and distribution, and import restrictions have all contributed to the economy’s inflationary pressures, with headline inflation leading the way.In addition to major macroeconomic effects, the study looked at COVID-19’s microeconomic effects by forecasting poverty. Due to reduced export earnings, external sector performance of Sri Lanka has weakened. Sri Lanka rupee has sharply depreciated against major currencies in the world. Finally, the COVID-19 welfare effect which is projected to be bigger than expected, will obstruct the country’s long-term economic progress. As a result, proper actions should be implemented to re-establish the economy while also controlling the pandemic’s spread.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",cpifTB

medical,"OBJECTIVE: The SAR‐COV‐2 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on the UK's healthcare systems. To reduce spread of the virus, elective treatments and surgeries have been postponed or canceled. There has been a rise in the use of telemedicine (TM) as an alternative way to carry outpatient consultations. This systematic review aims to evaluate the extent to which TM may be able to support cardiac and vascular surgery patients in the COVID‐19 era. METHODS: We looked into how TM can support the management of patients via triaging, preoperative, and postoperative care. Evaluations targeted the clinical effectiveness of common TM methods and the feasibility of applying those methods in the UK during this pandemic. RESULTS: Several studies have published their evidence on the benefit of TM and its benefit during COVID‐19, the data related to cardiovascular surgery and how this will impact future practice of this speciality is emerging and yet larger studies with appropriate timing of outcomes to be published. CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of virtual consultations and remote monitoring is feasible and best placed to support these patients via triaging and postoperative monitoring.

medical,"Objective: During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine has been brought to the forefront of attention. This report aimed to assess psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19 patients by utilizing telepsychiatry. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted in Fasa University Hospital and nonhospitalized outpatients of Fasa city were interviewed by a psychiatrist through video chat for a 1-month period (March-April, 2020). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS 14) questionnaires were administered for all patients. Each patient's mental status was recorded, and if any psychiatric problem was diagnosed, supportive psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up visits based on the patient's condition were started. Result: From a total of 82 COVID-19 patients who entered the study, 32 (39.03%) and 50 (60.97%) subjects were inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Moreover, 32 (39.03%) subjects were male and 50 (60.97%) were female. Insomnia seen in 24 (29.3%) patients and adjustment disorder in 13 (15.9%) patients were the most common psychiatric disorders among a total of 33 (40.2%) patients suffering from mental illness. Female and hospitalized patients presented significantly more frequent comorbidities than males and outpatients. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders were significantly more common in patients with hospital admission than those without and more frequent in female versus male subjects. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects with and without admission according to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-14 scores. It was concluded that telepsychiatry in the early stages of mental problems during a catastrophic event like the coronavirus pandemic, can be an efficient instrument for the screening of psychosomatic comorbidities, so that pharmacological treatment (considering possible drug interactions with COVID-19 medications) and psychotherapeutic intervention can be optimized by psychiatrists.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KvSVeP

medical,"INTRODUCTION: The objectives were: to measure the proportion of aspirated material used to make direct slides for rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) at endobronchial (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in suspected thoracic malignancy; and to correlate pass weights with ROSE category and needle size. METHOD: All EBUS and EUS cases for possible thoracic malignancy October 2018-May 2019 were included. All material from each pass was expelled into a Petri dish. One drop of material was placed on each of two slides; one used for ROSE, the other fixed and remaining material processed to cell block. Dish and slides were weighed before and after this procedure on a sensitive balance and weight of aspirate and slide material calculated. When ROSE identified malignancy, slide production ceased but target sampling for ancillary studies continued. RESULTS: ROSE accuracy was 96.8%. Mean percentage by target of aspirated material used to make direct slides for ROSE was 1.9% in malignant cases and 3.6% in non-malignant cases (P = .027 for difference). Mean percentage by pass was 5.9%. Mean weight of a single aspirate was 128.8 mg. Mean weight of aspirates insufficient on ROSE (175.7 mg) was significantly higher than the mean weight of benign or malignant aspirates (117.1 and 114.0 mg, respectively). Mean weight of aspirates using 22G needles (132.6 mg) was significantly higher than that for 25G needles (87.1 mg). CONCLUSION: Material made into direct slides at EBUS and EUS and used in part for ROSE uses a tiny proportion of aspirated material with over 98% processed to cell block and available for ancillary testing in malignant cases.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",zsCarh
medical,"In manifold learning, the intrinsic geometry of the manifold is explored and preserved by identifying the optimal local neighborhood around each observation. It is well known that when a Riemannian manifold is unfolded correctly, the observations lying spatially near to the manifold, should remain near on the lower dimension as well. Due to the nonlinear properties of manifold around each observation, finding such optimal neighborhood on the manifold is a challenge. Thus, a sub-optimal neighborhood may lead to erroneous representation and incorrect inferences. In this paper, we propose a rotation-based affinity metric for accurate graph Laplacian approximation. It exploits the property of aligned tangent spaces of observations in an optimal neighborhood to approximate correct affinity between them. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets have been performed. It is observed that proposed method outperforms existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques in low-dimensional representation for synthetic datasets. The results on real world datasets like COVID-19 prove that our approach increases the accuracy of classification by enhancing Laplacian regularization.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",KqQ7X_

medical,"The criteria for choosing between drip and ship and mothership transport strategies in emergency stroke care is widely debated. Although existing data-driven probability models can inform transport decision-making at an epidemiological level, we propose a novel mathematical, physiologically derived framework that provides insight into how patient characteristics underlying infarct core growth influence these decisions. METHODS: We represent the physiology of time-dependent infarct core growth within an ischemic penumbra as an exponential function with consideration to rate-determining collateral blood flow. Monte Carlo methods generate distributions of infarct core volumes, which are translated to distributions of 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores. We apply the model to a stroke network that serves rural Bastrop County and urban Travis County by simulating transport strategies from thousands of potential patient pickup locations. In every pickup location, the simulation yields a distribution of outcomes corresponding to each transport strategy. A 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Student t test determine which transport strategy provides a significantly better probability of a good outcome for a given pickup location in each respective county (P<0.01). RESULTS: In Travis County, drip and ship provides significantly better probabilities of a good outcome in 24.0% of the pickup locations, while 59.8% favor mothership. In Bastrop County, 11.3% of the pickup locations favor drip and ship, while only 7.1% favor mothership. The remaining pickup locations in each county are not statistically significant in either direction. We also reveal how differing rates of infarct core growth, the application of bypass policies, and the use of large vessel occlusion field tests impact these results. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling stroke physiology enables the use of clinically relevant metrics for determining comparative significance between drip and ship and mothership in a given geography. This formalism can help understand and inform emergency medical service transport decision-making, as well as regional bypass policies.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Rtvpe1

medical,"Teleneurology in Spain had not been implemented so far in clinical practice, except in urgent patients with stroke. Telemedicine was hardly used in epilepsy, and patients and neurologists usually preferred onsite visits. Our goal was to study impressions of adult and pediatric epileptologists about the use of telemedicine after emergent implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was sent to the members of the Spanish Epilepsy Society and the members of the Epilepsy Study Group of the Catalan Neurological Society, inquiring about different aspects of telemedicine in epilepsy during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 66 neurologists responded, mostly adult neurologists (80.3%), the majority with a monographic epilepsy clinic (4 out of 5). Of all respondents, 59.1% reported to attend more than 20 patients with epilepsy (PWE) a week. During the pandemic, respondents handled their epilepsy clinics mainly with telephone calls (88%); only 4.5% used videoconference. Changes in antiseizure medications were performed less frequently than during onsite visits by 66.6% of the epileptologists. Scales were not administered during these visits, and certain types of information such as sudden expected unrelated death in epilepsy (SUDEP) were felt to be more appropriate to discuss in person. More than 4 out of 5 of the neurologists (84.8%) stated that they would be open to perform some telematic visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, emergent implantation of teleneurology has shown to be appropriate for the care of many PWE.

medical,"Y The 2019 Coronavirus disease is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in certain individuals. In such individuals, non-invasive and invasive ventilation methods are used to treat ARDS. Non-invasive ventilation approaches must be used initially before introducing intrusive mechanical ventilation techniques. Non-invasive methods used in the therapy of COVID-19 associated ARDS include high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive air pressure, and helmet ventilation. Before employing any of these non-invasive methods, the risk of viral aerosol transmission to healthcare and paramedical personnel must be considered. When non-invasive procedures are used, the load on hospital ventilatory equipment can be reduced. If at all possible, avoid intubating the patient too soon. The clinical appearance of the patient, as well as vital indicators such as oxygen saturation and respiratory rate must be evaluated on frequent basis in order to determine whether the patient requires ventilation. In COVID-19 patients, the judicious application of non-invasive and invasive breathing methods can minimize the risk of death from ARDS.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DUHdNT
medical,"Drug repositioning is a strategy that identifies new uses of approved drugs to treat conditions different from their original purpose. Current efforts to treat Covid-19 are based on this strategy. The first drugs used in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were antimalarial drugs. It is their mechanism of action, i. e., rise in endosomal pH, which recommends them against the new coronavirus. Disregarding their side effects, the study of their antiviral activity provides valuable hints for the choice and design of drugs against SARS-CoV-2. One prominent drug candidate is thymoquinone, an antimalarial substance contained in Nigella sativa – most likely one of the first antimalarial drugs in human history. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the number of articles relating thymoquinone to Covid-19 continuously increases. Here, we use it as an exemplary model drug, compare its antiviral mechanism with that of conventional antimalarial drugs and establish an irreducible parametric scheme for the identification of drugs with a potential in Covid-19.Translation into the laboratory is simple. Starting with the discovery of Nigella sativa seeds in the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, we establish a physicochemical model for the interaction of thymoquinone with both coronavirus and cells. Exploiting the predictive capability of the model, we provide a generalizable scheme for the systematic choice and design of drugs for Covid-19. An unexpected offshoot of our research is that Tutankhamun could not have died of malaria, a finding contrary to the mainstream theory.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",rp3wcm

medical,"BACKGROUND Accidental vessel occlusion is one major risk of intracranial aneurysm surgery potentially causing cerebral ischemia. The intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia remains a technological challenge. OBJECTIVE As a novel approach, cortical tissue integrity was monitored using simultaneous measurements of regional capillary-venous cerebral blood flow (rvCBF), oxygen saturation (Srvo2), and hemoglobin amount (rvHb) during aneurysm surgery. METHODS Fifteen patients scheduled for aneurysm surgery of the anterior and posterior circulation were included. A fiber optic probe was placed on the cortex associated with the distal branch of the aneurysmatic vessel. Blinded measurements by combined laser-Doppler flowmetry (rvCBF) and photospectrometry (Srvo2, rvHb) were performed before and after surgical clipping or trapping of the aneurysm. Data were correlated with postoperative imaging and neurological outcome. RESULTS Cortical measurements could be successfully performed in all patients. Significant increase (>25% change from baseline) or decrease (<25% change from baseline) of rvCBF, Srvo2, and rvHb was detectable in 33 to 46% of patients after surgical intervention. Severe decrease (>50% change from baseline) of all parameters or solitary of rvCBF was correlated to reduced cerebral perfusion and neurological deficits in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and photospectrometry provides real-time information on cortical microcirculation. Intraoperative alterations of parameters (rvCBF, Srvo2, rvHb) might reflect changes of cerebral tissue integrity during intracranial aneurysm surgery.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",QiA3t3

medical,"Commercial milk formula for pregnant women (CMF-PW) is an expensive, ultra-processed food with a high concentration of sugar, the consumption of which may be linked to negative health outcomes. However, CMF-PWs are promoted as beneficial for pregnant women and lactating mothers as well as their children. To date, little is known about the factors associated with the use of CMF-PW among pregnant women. We performed this analysis to examine the association between the use of CMF-PW and related beliefs and norms among pregnant women in Vietnam. We interviewed 268 pregnant women in their second and third trimesters from two provinces and one municipality representing diverse communities in Vietnam. Multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression, structural equation modeling (SEM), and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis were used to examine associations between beliefs and social norms related to CMF-PW and reported consumption, characterized as occasional, recent, and never during the current pregnancy. Overall, 64.6% of pregnant women reported using CMF-PW during the current pregnancy and 34.7% consumed CMF-PW on the day prior to the interview. Strong beliefs that CMF-PW will make a child smart and healthy (53.7%) and the perception that use of CMF-PW is common (70.9%) were associated with increased use on the previous day (beliefs: aOR: 3.56; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.65, 7.71; p < 0.01 and social norms aOR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.66; p < 0.05). SEM and PSM analyses confirmed these findings for both occasional and regular CMF-PW use. Results are consistent with observations of CMF-PW product labels and marketing tactics in Vietnam. The prevalent use of CMF-PW in Vietnam is associated with the belief that these products make children smart and healthy and the perceived social norm that most mothers use these products, which mirrors marketing messages and approaches employed by the CMF industry.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ja3CWo

These are primarily petroleum-derived plastics but the contribution of bio-based plastics estimated at the level of 1% in the plastic market in 2019 is expected to be increasing. Simultaneously, the significant part of plastic waste is still disposed improperly and pollutes the environment making a threat to all living organisms. In this work three plastic materials, two bio-based biodegradable: polylactide (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and one petroleum-derived non-biodegradable polypropylene (PP) were studied towards their effects on seed germination and early growth of higher plants. The following plants were used as bioindicators: monocotyledonous plant - Sorghum saccharatum and two dicotyledonous plants: Sinapsis alba and Lepidium sativum. Plastics did not affect seed germination of higher plants even at the highest concentration tested (11.9% w/w) but their presence in soil acted in various ways on growth of the plants. Either no or inhibitive or stimulation effects on growth of roots or stems were noticed. It depended on the concentration and chemical composition of the plastic tested, and plant species. PHB and PLA more often caused to the inhibition of root growth than PP did. This phenomenon was observed in particular with regard to the dicotyledonous plants. Moreover, in the tests with the dicotyledonous plants (S. alba and L. sativum) the dose-response relations were usually determined as statistically relevant. Among these plants cress (L. sativum) occurred to be more sensitive and allowed for obtaining the dose-response dependence for both root and stem length, and, what is important, it took place in the case of each of materials tested. Therefore, cress is recommended to be used as a bioindicator in the assessment of the effect of plastics (petroleum-derived and bio-based plastics) on the early stages of growth of higher plants.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",pO59Ty

medical,"OBJECTIVE: High-quality longitudinal evidence exploring the mental health risk associated with low-quality employment trajectories is scarce. We therefore aimed to investigate the risk of being diagnosed with common mental disorders, substance use disorders, or suicide attempt according to low-quality employment trajectories. METHODS: A longitudinal register-study based on the working population of Sweden (N=2 743 764). Employment trajectories (2005–2009) characterized by employment quality and pattern (constancy, fluctuation, mobility) were created. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models for first incidence (2010–2017) diagnosis of common mental disorders, substance use disorders and suicide attempt as dependent on employment trajectories. RESULTS: We identified 21 employment trajectories, 10 of which were low quality (21%). With the exception of constant solo self-employment, there was an increased risk of common mental disorders (HR 1.07–1.62) and substance use disorders (HR 1.05–2.19) for all low-quality trajectories. Constant solo self-employment increased the risk for substance use disorders among women, while it reduced the risk of both disorders for men. Half of the low-quality trajectories were associated with a risk increase of suicide attempt (HR 1.08–1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality employment trajectories represent risk factors for mental disorders and suicide attempt in Sweden, and there might be differential effects according to sex – especially in terms of self-employment. Policies ensuring and maintaining high-quality employment characteristics over time are imperative. Similar prospective studies are needed, also in other contexts, which cover the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the mechanisms linking employment trajectories with mental health.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",OELopH

METHODS: Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) (n = 229) employed at 7 fire stations operated by the North Chungcheong Fire Service Headquarters, South Korea were trained to use ICT-EMS devices prior to a 1-month implementation period. System Usability Scale (SUS), Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), and Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) questionnaires were conducted in the 4th week of the 1-month implementation period to assess the perceived usability, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the ICT-EMS systems. RESULTS: Among a total of 229 EMTs, 187 EMTs (81.7%) completed the survey. The overall SUS score was significantly low (score of 35.6) indicating an overall negative perception of the ICT-EMS systems. With regard to the feasibility, acceptability, and intervention appropriateness of ICT-EMS, roughly 50 (26.7%) participants agreed that ICT-EMS implementation was possible, appealing, and suitable.

medical,"As the incidence of COVID-19 increases with time, more and more efforts are made to pave a way out for the therapeutic strategies to deal with the disease progression. Inflammation being a significant influencer in COVID-19 patients, it drives our focus onto the signaling cascades of the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK phosphorylation mediated by cytokine receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of STATs that translocate into the nucleus to translate for inflammatory mediators. The SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins like spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins along with the non- structural proteins 1-16 including proteases like 3CL (pro) and PL(pro) promote its entry and survival in hosts. The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammation via the JAK/STAT pathway leading to recruitment of pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells progressing towards cytokine storm. This produces various inflammatory markers in the host that determine the disease severity. The JAK/STAT signaling also mediates immune responses via B cell and T cell differentiation.With an attempt to reduce excessive inflammation, JAK/STAT inhibitors like Ruxolitinib, Baricitinib, Tofacitinib have been employed that mediate its actions via suppressors of cytokine signaling, cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein, Protein inhibitor of activated STAT and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Even though they are implicated with multiple adverse effects, the regulatory authorities have supported its use, and numerous clinical trials are in progress to prove their safety and efficacy. On the contrary, the exact mechanism of JAK/STAT inhibition at molecular levels remains speculative for which further investigations are required.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",t0upXx

This period was fraught with uncertainty for those in the affected areas. The present investigation examined the role of two potential coping resources during this stressful period of uncertainty: flow and mindfulness. Participants in Wuhan and other major cities affected by COVID-19 (N = 5115) completed an online survey assessing experiences of flow, mindfulness, and well-being. Longer quarantine was associated with poorer well-being;flow and mindfulness predicted better well-being on some measures. However, flow—but not mindfulness—moderated the link between quarantine length and well-being, such that people who experienced high levels flow showed little or no association between quarantine length and poorer well-being. These findings suggest that engaging in flow-inducing activities may be a particularly effective way to protect against the deleterious effects of a period of quarantine.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",RQZ6Jz

medical,"Negative symptoms are core features of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders that are frequently observed across all phases of illness. By their nature, COVID-19 social isolation, physical distancing, and health precautions induce behavioural aspects of negative symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these prevention measures also lead to increases in experiential negative symptoms, whether such effects are equivalent across individual negative symptom domains, and if exacerbations occur equivalently across phases of illness. The current study compared negative symptom severity scores obtained during the pandemic to pre-pandemic assessments in two samples: (1) outpatients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ: n = 32) and matched healthy controls (CN: n = 31) and (2) individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR: n = 25) and matched CN (n = 30). Pre-pandemic ratings of negative symptoms were clinically elevated in SZ and CHR groups, which did not differ from each other in severity. In SZ, ratings obtained during the pandemic were significantly higher than pre-pandemic ratings for all 5 domains (alogia, blunted affect, anhedonia, avolition, and asociality) and item-level analyses indicated that exacerbations occurred on both experiential and behavioral symptoms of anhedonia, avolition, and asociality. In contrast, CHR only exhibited increases in anhedonia and avolition items during the pandemic compared to pre-ratings. Findings suggest that negative symptoms should be a critical treatment target during and after the pandemic in the schizophrenia spectrum given that they are worsening and critically related to risk for conversion, functional outcome, and recovery.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ETI_kr

medical,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To characterize adult Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. DESIGN: We encountered an adult patient with severe bronchiolitis in the absence of pneumonia due to M pneumoniae. To determine the relative frequency of such a condition, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adults over a 4-year period with a hospital discharge diagnosis of “bronchiolitis” from a university hospital. SETTING: University Hospital of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. STUDY SUBJECTS: From 1994 to 1998, 10 adult inpatients were identified with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. There were two with respiratory bronchiolitis, one with panbronchiolitis, one patient with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and six with acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. Including the initial patient, three had a definitive clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis. RESULTS: The three adult patients with bronchiolitis due to M pneumoniae are unusual because they occurred in the absence of radiographic features of a lobar or patchy alveolar pneumonia. Hospital admission was occasioned by the severity of symptoms and gas exchange abnormalities. One patient had bronchiolitis as well as organizing pneumonia (BOOP) that responded favorably to corticosteroid treatment. The other two had high-resolution CT findings diagnostic of an acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. One of the patients with inflammatory bronchiolitis had an unusual pattern of marked ventilation and perfusion defects localized predominantly to the left lung. All three had restrictive ventilatory impairment on physiologic testing. CONCLUSIONS: In adults, Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis without pneumonia is rarely reported, but in hospitalized patients, it may be more common than expected and may be associated with severe physiologic disturbances.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",ktyp6_
medical,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We aimed to compare the performance of the ZeroGravity (ZG) system (radiation protection system composed by a suspended lead suit) against the use of standard protection (lead apron (LA), thyroid shield, lead eyeglasses, table skirts, and ceiling suspended shield) in neuroangiography procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Radiation exposure data were prospectively collected in consecutive neuroendovascular procedures between December 2014 and February 2015. Operator No 1 was assigned to the use of an LA (plus lead glasses, thyroid shield, and a 1 mm hanging shield at the groin) while operator No 2 utilized the ZG system. Dosimeters were used to measure peak skin dose for the head, thyroid, and left foot. RESULTS The two operators performed a total of 122 procedures during the study period. The ZG operator was more commonly the primary operator compared with the LA operator (85% vs 71%; p=0.04). The mean anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and cumulative dose area product (DAP) radiation exposure as well as the mean fluoroscopy time were not statistically different between the operators' cases. The peak skin dose to the head of the operator with LA was 2.1 times higher (3380 vs 1600 μSv), while the thyroid was 13.9 (4460 vs 320 μSv), the mediastinum infinitely (520 vs 0 μSv), and the foot 3.3 times higher (4870 vs 1470 μSv) compared with the ZG operator, leading to an overall accumulated dose 4 times higher. The ratio of cumulative operator received dose/total cumulative DAP was 2.5 higher on the LA operator. CONCLUSIONS The ZG radiation protection system leads to substantially lower radiation exposure to the operator in neurointerventional procedures. However, substantial exposure may still occur at the level of the lens and thyroid to justify additional protection.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",DZ69YU

medical,"The WHO has highlighted the technical challenges of assessing immunity status, cautioning against immunity passports. Similarly, the ECDC indicated that “current scientific knowledge that exists on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 (quality, quantity and duration of human antibodies) or the available testing methods (laboratory based and point-of-care)” does not support their use. Accordingly, the European Commission has emphasised the risks compulsory testing, noting that “border control [is not] an effective measure to limit the transmission of the virus, while the Council of Europe raises awareness of the interference of SARS-CoV-2 measures on human rights, underlining that “the major social, political and legal challenge facing our Member States will be their ability to respond to this crisis effectively, whilst ensuring that the measures they take do not undermine our genuine long-term interest in safeguarding Europe's founding values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law”. Nevertheless, immunity passports and immunity registries are being discussed more than ever before, with governments under pressure to find a viable solution. This presentation will examine the GDPR, and current legislation protecting rights vs. legislation allowing testing, quarantine, administration of medicines, recording of immunity vs. vaccination. It will debate the legal nature of immunity passports and the relevance to fundamental European freedoms, linking key concepts to global public health law. Implications regarding the personal right in Health/right of Public Health and legal substance and human rights limitations will also be examined. Criteria and the use of immunity passports as limitations of human rights -prescribed by law, legitimate aim and necessary in a democratic society- with extrapolation in terms of discrimination will be discussed.

medical,"Computer vision has advanced greatly in the last years, providing a useful tool to extract information from images and video streams, enhancing the capabilities of classical video detection algorithms. In the transport field, it may be used in many applications, like information systems (for people and vehicle count, identification of lost objects, etc.), but is mature enough to be trusted also safety systems (monitoring rails for foreign objects, illegal crossings, and many more). In this article, the authors present a solution to detect crowdedness in public transport stations, that can be helpful for local authorities/public transport operators to make proper decisions regarding anti-Covid measures, but also enhance the response of the public transport system. © 2021 IEEE.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",txK0_I

medical,"Job satisfaction is determined as the measure to know the individuals’ feelings toward their work. The working conditions that can affect satisfaction and performance of the call center agents have received particular concern. This study aimed to determine the role of remote call center working on agents’ satisfaction compared to onsite workers. A cross-section study was conducted between December 2020 and April 2021 that include 124 agents working in a governmental medical call center in Saudi Arabia. Each agent was receiving a questionnaire that investigates his/her satisfaction with the job nature, supervisor support, job autonomy, job productivity, and performance. Seventy-seven physicians working onsite were compared to forty-seven physicians remotely working in the medical call center. The mean age of the physicians included was 43.17 ± 8.4 years, and most of them were male (>70%), married (>85%), and family medicine specialists (>50%). The mean years of experience in the medical field of the physicians included was 16.87 ± 8.07 years, and the mean years of experience in the medical call center was 1.44 ± .97 years. Onsite agents were more satisfied concerning job nature, supervisor support, productivity, and performance compared to remote agents (70.82 vs 53.47%, 63.38 vs 55.05%, and 66.51 vs 56.03%, respectively). However, onsite agents were less satisfied regarding job autonomy than remote physicians (46.81 vs 53.19%, P-value = .128). Overall, general satisfaction was more seen in physicians working onsite as opposed to remote workers in the medical call center in Saudi Arabia (64.90 vs 54.25%, P-value < .01).",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",yQY6HS

medical,"The current pandemic of SARS-CoV‑2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a particular challenge for diabetes patients. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to a particularly severe course of the disease and doubles the COVID-19 mortality risk due to pulmonary and cardiac involvement. In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes. Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly. On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies. Hence, the opportunity of the COVID 19 crisis should be taken to make a significant step forward in the care for diabetes patients.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",_7I5fR

medical,"Inspired by Fiset-Laniel et al.’s (2020) article entitled “Public health investments: neglect or wilful omission? Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada”, we assessed public health investments since the establishment of the Nova Scotia provincial health authority in 2015. We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015−2016 to 2019–2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5–6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015–2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health work, and the need for a pandemic recovery plan that prioritizes investment in all areas of public health in Nova Scotia.",Malikeh1375/medical-question-answering-datasets,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",jF9cH1

medical,"Q:A 49-year-old woman presents to her physician with a fever accompanied by chills and burning micturition since the past 5 days. She is an otherwise healthy woman with no significant past medical history and has an active sexual life. On physical examination, her temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse rate is 90/min, blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Examination of the abdomen and genitourinary region do not reveal any specific positive findings. The physician orders a urinalysis of fresh unspun urine for this patient which shows 25 WBCs/mL of urine. The physician prescribes an empirical antibiotic and other medications for symptom relief. He also orders a bacteriological culture of her urine. After 48 hours of treatment, the woman returns to the physician to report that her symptoms have not improved. The bacteriological culture report indicates the growth of gram-negative bacilli which are lactose-negative and indole-negative, which produce a substance that hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia. Which of the following bacteria is the most likely cause of infection in the woman??
