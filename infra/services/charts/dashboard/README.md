## Templating Support in Values File

> See the [Values](#values) section for more information on the values that
support templates.

### Overview

This Helm chart provides advanced support for templating directly
within the values.yaml file. By leveraging Helm's powerful templating engine,
users can dynamically generate values based on their deployment context. This
allows for flexible, context-aware configurations that automatically adapt to
the specific environment, release, or other settings defined during chart
installation.

### How Templating Works Templating within the values.yaml file works similarly
to templating in Helm chart templates. You can use Go templating syntax to
dynamically generate values based on the built-in Helm objects like .Values,
.Release, .Chart, and more.

For example, you can use templating to automatically inject the release name,
set image tags based on a commit SHA, or dynamically generate labels and
annotations based on the environment.

### Usage Examples Here are a few common use cases where templating in the
values.yaml file can be particularly powerful:

- **Dynamic Image Tags**:

  Automatically set the image tag based on the commit SHA, branch name, or other
  Git metadata.

    ```yaml
    image:
      repository: "registry.gitlab.com/whylabs/<CHARTNAME>"
      tag: "{{ .Values.commitSha }}"
    ```

- **Conditional Environment Variables**:

  Set environment variables based on conditions, such as the deployment
  environment.

    ```yaml
    env:
      MY_ENV_VAR: "my env var value"
      MY_TEMPLATE_VAR: "{{ if eq .Values.instance \"main\" }}true{{ else }}false{{ end }}"
    ```

- **Dynamic Labels and Annotations**:

  Use templating to dynamically generate labels and annotations based on the
  release or environment.

    ```yaml
    commonLabels:
      template.example.com/env: "{{ .Values.environment }}"

    podAnnotations:
      template.example.com/sha: "{{ .Values.commitSha }}"
    ```

## User-Defined Supplemental Kubernetes Manifests

### Overview

The extraManifests field in the values.yaml file provides a flexible way to
include additional Kubernetes resource manifests as part of your Helm release.
This field is designed to accept a list of Kubernetes manifest definitions,
allowing you to specify any arbitrary Kubernetes resources that should be
deployed alongside the standard resources defined in the Helm chart.

### How It Works

The extraManifests field is a list where each item represents a complete
Kubernetes resource definition, written in YAML. These resources are processed
and deployed as part of the Helm release, just like the chart's built-in
resources. This functionality is particularly useful when you need to deploy
custom resources, additional ConfigMaps, Jobs, or other Kubernetes objects that
aren't covered by the main chart templates.

### Templating Support

Like other parts of the values.yaml file, the extraManifests field fully
supports Helm's templating engine. This means you can use templating syntax to
dynamically generate values within your custom resources based on the deployment
context. For example, you can inject the release name, environment-specific
settings, or other dynamic values directly into your additional manifests.

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the extraManifests field to include additional resources
with your Helm deployment:

```yaml
extraManifests:
  - apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: "{{.Release.Name }}-job"
      annotations:
        "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: "{{ .Release.Service }}"
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
            helm.sh/chart: "{{ .Chart.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
          - name: example-job
            image: "alpine:3.3"
            command:
              - "/bin/sleep"
              - "10"
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-config"
    data:
      my-config-key: "my-config-value"
```

In this example:

- The first item adds a Kubernetes Job to the deployment, which will run as a
pre-install hook, executing before the main resources are deployed.

- The second item adds a ConfigMap to the deployment, allowing you to define
configuration data that can be used by other resources in the cluster.

### Why Use extraManifests?

- Flexibility: Deploy any Kubernetes resource alongside your Helm release,
whether it's a custom resource (CR), additional service, or any other Kubernetes
object.

- Centralized Management: Manage all related Kubernetes resources in a single
Helm chart, reducing the need to deploy additional manifests separately.

- Templating: Use the power of Helm's templating engine to create dynamic,
context-aware resources that automatically adapt to your environment or release
settings.
