# WhyLogsV1 Parser

This package includes a Java WhyLogs V1 format parser.  It can read WhyLogsV1 `bin` files and parse them into WhyLogs metrics in a memory-efficient manner.

## TODO
* [ ] Finish implementation of WhyLogsMetrics for complex (non-scalar) types
* [ ] Reconcile this codebase with Mellie's work on the JVM WhyLogsV1 producer
